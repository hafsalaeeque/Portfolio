# SAT Score Exploratory Analysis

In my first weeks study data science I did some exploratory analysis of SAT Scores across the United States.

Some of the descriptive analysis was done using python and a little bit of visual analysis was conducted using Tableau.
A few of the visualizations are embeded in the iPython Notebook, additionally the link to the Interactive Tableau Vizualizations is below.

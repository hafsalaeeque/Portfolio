0,Fiola Mare,"Italian, Seafood",$$$$,"With Fabio Trabocchi’s ascent to the top spot on our list—almost a decade after he wowed us with the late Maestro—it seems an apt time to retire the standard description of Fiola Mare as Italian. It’s not. It’s Trabocchian. The chef, now in his forties, has evolved a style all his own, one informed by his food-rich upbringing in Italy’s Marche region but not beholden to it—a style that embraces influences from France, Japan, and America. No chef in our area is cooking with more subtlety or power or with more expressive range. Take his filet of poached cod, paired with puréed artichoke and chickpea crema—it’s a trio that feels both unexpected and inevitably right. Or his Japanese madai tartare, with its perfect embellishment of grapefruit and paddlefish roe. This is a luxury restaurant, and it’s extravagantly expensive. But the quality of the fish is extraordinary (on par with New York City’s Le Bernardin), and no restaurant in the area will spoil you more.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-fiola-mare
1,Komi,"Mediterranean, Modern",$$$$,"How a room of such quiet minimalism can feel so warm and embracing is among the dining scene’s enduring mysteries. But that’s Komi’s magic, no tricks required. The seeming effortlessness of the pacing is a credit to one of the region’s best staffs, a group of earnest folks expert in reading tables and moods, who don’t merely keep the water glasses filled but—corny as it sounds—endeavor to make memories. Johnny Monis’s cooking—nominally Mediterranean but drawing on a range of global influences—never fails to surprise, and not just because the absence of a menu keeps you from knowing what’s coming. The night starts with a procession of bites that eschew cleverness in favor of flavors that are pure and clear—none so memorable, perhaps, as a date stuffed with mascarpone and roasted until it takes on the umami richness of foie gras. From there, it’s on to hand-rolled pastas, then a lusty portion of, among others, crisp-skinned goat or baby pig, meant to summon a communal feast along the Mediterranean coast. Desserts, a weak link in the past, have improved and provide a fittingly glorious finish.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-komi
2,Little Serow,Thai,$$$,"If you’ve been to Johnny Monis and Anne Marler’s English basement turned Thai restaurant in the last couple of years, you’ll likely be familiar with many of the plates on the seven-dish family-style menu. But like a band deep into its tour, the set list has become tighter and the chords more masterful, even if the songs are well known. The fabled fieriness has been finely tuned, too. Rather than making diners beg for palate-soothing glasses of full-fat milk from the start, the spicing now slowly builds, crescendoes (with a sweat-inducing tofu salad), then abates with a plate of mild pork ribs marinated with Mekong whiskey and strewn with dill. The servers, all got up in oxford shoes and dresses that could be called schoolmarm-chic, possess a genuine warmth and excitement—they seem as in love with the place as we are.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-little-serow
3,Convivial,"American, French",$$,"It’s not as if Cedric Maupillier were an unknown—his creativity and skill have been on vivid display at Mintwood Place for years—but with his first restaurant as both owner and chef, he’s a chef unleashed. A protégé of Michel Richard, Maupillier sometimes channels his mentor’s wit and precision: Witness his fried-chicken coq au vin, which combines the rustic depth of the French country staple with the supernal crunch of the Korean shop Bonchon. There’s reverence, too, for tradition, and the menu, more French than American, abounds in the kind of patiently developed flavors you might not find so easily in Paris these days. Maupillier’s ravioli is one example: filled with an earthy boudin noir and paired with both a chestnut purée and a mushroom fricassee. Like many dishes on the menu, it was conceived with wine in mind, the flavors intensifying further with a sip of Syrah or Bordeaux. Justin Guthrie’s list contains a number of good ones, and also some bargains. Convivial itself deserves credit for being such a value—it could easily charge more for cooking of this excitement and quality. That it chooses to be accessible just makes it that much more lovable.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-convivial
4,Rasika and Rasika West End,Indian,$$,"Restaurateur Ashok Bajaj and chef Vikram Sunderam have been repeatedly solicited to bring Rasika to New York and other dining-destination cities. Though Bajaj has no plans to expand outside of DC—he prefers to make daily rounds to his eight restaurants—it’s a testament to how special the Indian restaurant remains ten years into existence, not only in Washington but also on a national stage. Sunderam, who garnered his first James Beard Award in 2014 for best chef in the Mid-Atlantic, continues to helm the kitchens of the Penn Quarter original and younger West End sibling with a consistency and creativity that are rare. (Picking between the two is mostly a preference of neighborhood, though we’re partial to the original’s recently refreshed design.) His menu mixes traditional tandoori meats and curries with such inventive creations as snapper over creamy coconut noodles or braised lobster in a dough-encrusted vessel. Knowledgeable sommeliers are quick to recommend spice-friendly wines.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-rasika-rasika-west-end/
5,Plume,American,$$$$,"It’s not just the sumptuous elegance of the space that envelops you in a fantasy. It’s all the many appurtenances that reinforce the air of tasteful luxury—the upholstered stools for purses, the thick linen napkins, the silver domes to keep plates hot, the elaborate amuse-bouche to start, the petits fours to finish. The cooking, under the direction of Ralf Schlegel, avoids the pothole that fine dining at the highest levels is surprisingly prone to: the tendency to deliver technically perfect but soulless food. Schlegel brings imagination as well as rigor, most notably in a preparation of salmon poached tableside in liquefied beeswax (the filet emerges as succulent as a piece of chu-toro), and his more classical treatments (a seared breast of duck or loin of venison) sing with the quality of his saucing. The sommelier, Jennifer Knowles, is your ally—capable, with one daring wine pairing, of turning a very good dish into something magical.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-plume
6,Bad Saint,Filipino,$$,"Yes, another DC restaurant where you have to show up, put your name on a list, and wait. And what do you wait for? Not a table, most likely. (Most of the 24 seats are stools.) Here’s why it’s worth the hassle: because this nouveau Filipino kitchen is cranking out some of the most exhilarating, interesting dishes in all of Washington. You can smell the garlic and vinegar hitting the wok from down the block. If your experience of Filipino food is limited to tastes of sisig and adobo, you’re in for an awakening. But even if you’re well acquainted with the cuisine, you may be in for one, too. Witness chef Tom Cunanan’s shrimp-and-sweet-potato fritter, teased into an unruly mass that calls to mind Questlove’s spiky fro—the crunch is glorious. Likewise, he transforms a workmanlike breakfast of meat, egg, and garlicky rice into a composed dinner plate of unexpected intricacy and balance. Note to our fellow over-35s: You might not fit in among all the cool kids here, but co-owner Genevieve Villamora and her staff will see to it that you’re made to feel like family.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-bad-saint
7,The Inn at Little Washington,"American, Modern",$$$$,"Turning the big 4-0? Celebrating an anniversary? There are few more over-the-top occasion markers in the country than Patrick O’Connell’s baroque Rappahannock County getaway. The grande-dame decor, with its mauve silk lampshades and tapestries, isn’t for every taste, but the place somehow doesn’t feel stuffy. Credit O’Connell’s seamless fusion of folksy and fancy. Each of the three five-course menus—one seasonal, one vegetarian, one comprising the kitchen’s classics (you can mix them up)—kick off with an array of perfect amuse-bouches, including a shot of red-pepper soup, one of the best bisques we’ve tasted, and a tiny potato chip stuffed with pimiento cheese. (One thing we’d avoid: having them with the bill-jacking cocktails, which include an unfortunate $25 mix of Champagne and root-beer-flavored liqueur.) What’s that mooing sound? That would be Faira, a cow/cheese cart that makes the whole place break out in laughs every time she rolls in.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-the-inn-at-little-washington
8,Casa Luca,Italian,$$$,"This was supposed to be Fabio Trabocchi’s simplest, most accessible restaurant. Oh, some dishes are served family-style and meant to evoke the Italian countryside, and nearly every one is carried off with a minimum of fuss. But there’s a rigor and a passion that lift the place above a casual trattoria. The fish has always shone here—don’t miss one of the area’s best tuna tartares—but lately the strength of the pastas (including a beet-stuffed casonsei and a spinach pappardelle) have been making it difficult to decide what to order. The quality of the cooking alone would be enough to earn the place a spot on the list. But add in a savvy staff, a sinuous soundtrack of Sinatra and other oldies, and a crackerjack wine list, and you have what the place was never intended to be: a culinary statement.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-casa-luca
9,Izakaya Seki,Japanese,$$,"The Japanese izakaya trend has taken off in Washington, but there’s nothing scene-seeking about this spare gem. Father/daughter team Hiroshi and Cizuka Seki quietly conduct one of the most impressive dining experiences in town. He stays behind the kitchen counter—among the best seats in the bilevel house—while she roams the dining rooms, often guiding guests to the best sake and soju pairings. Part of the thrill arrives with the illustrated specials menu, which lists assortments of sashimi flown in from Japan and might include fried or grilled delicacies such as custardy barbecue eel. That’s not to say you should disregard the regular menu, which highlights dishes Hiroshi has honed to perfection—the scallop carpaccio remains one of our favorite bites anywhere.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-izakaya-seki
10,The Source,"Chinese, Pan-Asian",$$$$,"The turnaround-of-the-year award goes to Wolfgang Puck’s DC satellite, which got both a renovation and a serious jolt of energy in the kitchen, still overseen by longtime deputy Scott Drewno. The menu is now almost exclusively Asian fusion, and you’ll hardly miss the Kobe sliders. The duck for two is transcendent, with lacquered skin and tender meat served with bao buns and a bevy of condiments. To start, get dumplings in any and all forms—steamed and filled with shrimp and scallop, fried and stuffed with pork and chive. Even better, order them on a Monday, when they’re discounted to five bucks a plate.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-the-source
11,Masseria,Italian,$$$$,"Hiding along a block that fringes Union Market is one of the most seductive restaurant spaces around—with a pool-blue patio in front and a warmly lit raw-brick dining room inside. You can choose among three-, four-, and five-course tasting menus, and whatever you opt for, make sure pasta plays a role. Chef/owner Nick Stefanelli came up in some of the area’s top Italian kitchens (the late Laboratorio del Galileo and Maestro), and his sophisticated compositions—linguine with salty, garlicky XO sauce, penne with cauliflower and raisins—are among the city’s best. The cocktails, including a fuchsia Negroni tinted with beet juice, are just as dreamy.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-masseria
12,Garrison,American,$$$,"You might recognize the name Rob Weland from his stints at Poste and at Cork. Or not. Weland keeps a low profile, choosing to spend his time in the kitchen, cooking—quaint thought! The great benefit of this single-minded devotion is that every dish is carefully wrought, with none of the sloppiness that can creep into a kitchen with an absentee chef. Weland works closely with a local farm, and the bounties are prominently featured (more in spring and summer, when the chef showcased a stunning heirloom-tomato salad). Pastas remain his signature. There are only two, but both are gorgeous testament to the art. Beware the mind/body split that results after just one taste: The body wants to devour the entire plate; the mind wants you to savor each remarkable bite.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-garrison
13,Vin 909 Winecafe,"Italian, Pizza",$$,"If you came only for the pizzas, you’d leave happy. Unlike most boutique pies in the area, these are cooked in a brick oven and topped with a hand more indulgent than judicious. With crusts this good, you can feel confident in trying a combination that lesser places could never pull off—say, foie gras and truffles. Small plates are just as worthy: Chef Justin Moore has a keen imagination and a refined palate, and the selections on this menu-within-the-menu—a soft mound of mozzarella with gelatin-molded pearls of balsamic vinegar, a plate of gorgeously fresh steamed clams—are rendered with care. Add in the Craftsman-bungalow setting and the nightly party the dining room and patio become, and you have not just a wonderful culinary destination but a getaway and respite.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-vin-909-winecafe/
14,Proof,American,$$$,"Steadiness is not one of the sexier virtues in the restaurant world. But settle into this dark-lit lair and you’ll appreciate what so many flashy newcomers lack: a maturity and poise that are evident at the outset, with a warm welcome and expert cocktails. It’s a wine bar, but without the preciousness of many others in the genre—a testament to the haimish sensibility of late owner Mark Kuller as well as the fact that it sits steps away from the Verizon Center. Haidar Karoum’s menu suits a range of needs and tastes. You can graze on cheeses and charcuterie, colorful salads, and flatbreads, or delve into a tasting menu of plates that blend rusticity with refinement. The wine list is one of the best in the area, full of crowd-pleasers and interesting finds. Jaded palates might not be tempted—nearly ten years on, the lineup no longer surprises—but then, you don’t come to Proof for the shock of the new; you come for the shock of the familiar done right.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-proof
15,Maketto,"Cambodian, Taiwanese",$$,"Erik Bruner-Yang’s indoor/outdoor space functions as a skate-culture-obsessed shop (hawking $184 hoodies and Brooklyn-made graffiti pens), a coffee bar, and a restaurant, where the tangy, spicy flavors of Cambodia and Taiwan are on full blast. It’s hard to turn down the insta-classics that have always been on the menu—fried chicken with fish-sauce caramel, pork buns—but the menu keeps evolving. Our latest obsession? Gruyère dumplings over zesty braised beef that has the texture of a great chili. For dessert (or breakfast), be sure to try the homey wonders from pastry chef Erica Skolnik.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-maketto
16,Blue Duck Tavern,American,$$$$,"How does a decade-old farm-to-table restaurant still feel exciting when tavern-chic concepts abound and bone marrow feels about as edgy as a kale Caesar? It recruits fresh talent, as this Park Hyatt dining room did last year. Chef Franck Loquet and pastry chef David Collier have taken on the kitchen with vigor. The marrow—on the menu since day one—now arrives crusted with everything-bagel seasoning that complements the unctuous center, while Collier’s “Nutella breakfast” dessert transports us to a dreamy weekend morning. Talent isn’t limited to the kitchen—try the exquisite blends from the tea cellar.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-blue-duck-tavern
17,Bistro Bis,French,$$$$,"Three decades ago, the French ruled the city’s restaurant scene. Today the Gallic presence is mostly confined to casual restaurants. This veteran from one of Washington’s most respected chefs, Jeff Buben, is among the few remaining bastions of the destinations of yore. It might call itself a bistro, but its intention is to woo you with the kind of elegantly sumptuous cooking that inspired countless cookbook writers to pen love letters to French cuisine. There’s nothing innovative about this approach, but to take a first, swooning bite of snails in garlicky butter, or fried sweetbreads so light they might as well be dumplings, is to feel gratitude for rear-guard stubbornness.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-bistro-bis
18,Central Michel Richard,"American, French",$$$,"Michel Richard is one of the most important chefs ever to run a kitchen in this city—or, for that matter, this country. But scan the menu at this warm-toned roost and what jumps out? The burgers, fries, and fried chicken—yes, the junk food among the honor roll of bistro classics. If you have a discerning eye, you’ll understand the process that went into them, but the marvelous thing about Richard’s cooking—as rendered by protégé David Deshaies—is that you don’t need to: These are complex dishes that taste simple. Dessert is a must, whether exquisite tarts or ice creams of liqueur-like intensity.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-central-michel-richard
19,Marcel's,French,$$$$,"At this hushed, dove-gray dining room—which last year underwent a $350,000 facelift—the solemn-toned servers wear black suits, not Chucks, and the maître d’ and team of captains make sure everything runs smoothly. It might feel like food church to some diners, but not to those who mourn a time when patrons still dressed for dinner. Chef Robert Wiedmaier’s menu honors canonical French preparations—a stunning veal-and-pheasant sausage is his signature—yet stays attuned to the culinary times: Mole powder adds depth to elk loin, while ponzu gel enlivens perfect slices of yellowtail crudo.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-marcels
20,Rose's Luxury,American,$$$,"The line still snakes down the block at Aaron Silverman’s no-reservations dining room, though the reward doesn’t quite inspire the sheer joy it used to. A once-airtight menu of knockout dishes now yields the occasional dud (a ho-hum Peruvian chicken). Still, to put things in perspective, we’re comparing what was a near-perfect dining experience with one that’s currently very, very good. We’ll continue to brave an hour-plus wait for, say, a meltingly tender goat confit. And, of course, for the warm welcome. Silverman’s rowhouse exudes hospitable charm, and this is still one of DC’s most happening parties.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-roses-luxury
21,Minibar,"American, Modern",$$$$,"José Andrés’s dining experience is both the most expensive dinner in DC ($275 a pop just for food) and probably the coolest science class you’ve ever been to. At a bar-for-12 fronting a bustling kitchen, you’ll not only eat your way through a set menu of 25 to 30 surrealist courses; you’ll learn how each is made—how, say, a corkscrew, a syringe, gelatin, and liquid nitrogen can create a knockout fusilli with pesto. Many dishes in the lineup these days are more about brow-raising wizardry than deliciousness—get ready for a lot of gelatinous textures—and the whole production feels more rushed than it has in years past. Still, for the food-obsessed, there’s no better show in town.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-minibar
22,Fiola,Italian,$$$$,"Fabio Trabocchi’s Penn Quarter flagship may not grab the same attention these days as its seafood-minded Georgetown sister, Fiola Mare (number one on our list this year). Still, it remains a power-dining paragon. Pastas are lovely across the board, whether delicate ravioli stuffed with lobster or pappardelle with deeply flavorful wild-boar ragu. As at Fiola Mare, fish is handled particularly well. During a year when tuna tartare is all over menus, the generously portioned ahi version here—done up with olives, Meyer lemon, and creamy sorrel sauce—stands out as one of the area’s best.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-fiola
23,Estadio,Spanish,$$,"If you ever want to convince brunch-haters that there’s more to the scene than tepid Benedict and flat mimosas, take them to this tapas house. We can’t think of a happier way to start a morning than with its toasted country bread with honey butter and Maldon salt, or some of the creamiest scrambled eggs we’ve tasted. There’s plenty more at dinnertime, when the no-reservations-after-6 dining room fills up fast—tiny, crusty sandwiches filled with oil-slicked chorizo and nutty Idiazabal cheese, plancha-grilled calamari doused with lemon, a cheesecake made with Manchego, and, to go with it all, killer gin-and-tonics and seasonal “slushitos.”",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-estadio
24,Sushi Capitol,"Japanese, Sushi",$$,"It doesn’t look like a top-tier sushi restaurant—it looks, in fact, like the kind of place you drop by for takeout: seven tables, little in the way of decor. Many who patronize the place don’t choose to stick around, but here’s why you should. The service is warm and inviting, the soundtrack will remind you why you need more Thelonious Monk in your life, and the fish sparkles— quite literally: The cut surface of the chu-toro and salmon were almost gleaming. Load up on rolls if you must, but this is a place to come and appreciate the subtlety and delicacy of the various white fishes that the Japanese—including chef Minoru Ogawa—prize. The $50 omakase remains one of the most underrated dining values out there.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-sushi-capitol
25,Jaleo,Spanish,$$,"We take Jaleo for granted. We do. Chew on this for a second: Jaleo has been around almost a quarter century. And how about this? The small-plates craze that you’ve maybe grown tired of but can’t possibly ignore? Jaleo birthed it. But the Dorian Gray of restaurants is still youthful and lively, with a menu that evolves in exciting ways. If you haven’t been in years, you’ll find an excellent selection of Spanish hams (including Ibérico, the ultimate in depth of flavor), along with several shiny new baubles (among them, a dish of uni with trout roe, a delicious means of conveying the salinity and sweetness of nature’s custard). As for the old standbys, such as garlic shrimp or fried cod fritters? Good as ever.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-jaleo
26,Preserve,American,$$$,"The mom-and-pop is ordinarily a simple place, humble and homey. And by one measure, this one, across from the legendary diner Chick & Ruth’s Delly on Annapolis’s Main Street, obeys convention. It doesn’t take long to discover, however, that what young vets Jeremy and Michelle Hoffman have come up with is a sophisticated, smartly run operation that belies its low-key intentions. Jeremy—an alum of the kitchens at Per Se, Nobu Fifty Seven, and Restaurant Eve—has crafted a small, focused menu that showcases both his global training (in particular, a facility with Asian flavors) and his Pennsylvania Dutch heritage (say, a lusty plate of pork with sauerkraut). His rendition of a tandy cake, the packaged chocolate/peanut-butter cookie-cake he and many Pennsylvanians grew up snacking on, is the best kind of upscale homage: as delicious as it is affectionate.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-preserve
27,The Riggsby,American,$$$,"Hidden in a hotel that resembles your average Dupont Deco apartment building is a keyhole-shaped doorway. Walk through and you’ll discover a place that transports you, Wes Anderson–style, to another time. The dining room looks late-’70s swank and celebrates cocktail-party relics such as the stuffed mushroom and the Harvey Wallbanger. But chef/owner Michael Schlow, also behind Tico in Logan Circle and a handful of well-regarded Boston-area restaurants, isn’t operating strictly within the realm of the nostalgic here. He and deputy Philippe Reininger also put forth lovely fish dishes—including a cut of striped bass with tangy squash purée and pancetta granola—that feel squarely in the 21st century.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-the-riggsby
28,Clarity,American,$$$,"The debut of this Vienna restaurant was among the most feel-good stories of the year. It marked the return of local boy Jonathan Krinn, once the wunderkind chef at 2941. When Krinn left to open the glitzy Inox, in Tysons, he failed—and failed big: a victim of the times (Inox opened in 2008, when the market crashed) and his own bloated dreams. Clarity is a more modest venture, a neighborhood restaurant first and foremost. Ambition has shrunk, to be sure, but the classical chops are still there, and it’s not hard to see that Krinn, working with ex–Central chef Jason Maddens, is relaxed and cooking with passion. Actually, you can taste it in dish after dish, from seared foie gras with blackberries to a rich two-patty burger that ought to come with four napkins. But among the most appealing aspects of the place are small flourishes—the freshly baked breads and happy-making desserts.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-clarity
29,Le Diplomate,French,$$$,"Washington’s buzziest, red-leatheriest French bistro is still jammed many nights, thanks to its no-surprises approach to Larousse Gastronomique–style cookery. This is the place if you’re in the mood for a strapping beef bourguignon, or an onion soup that tastes as if its broth has been simmering for days, or a perfectly brittle-crusted crème brûlée. But the magic of Le Dip comes from more than that—the lovely little cocktails (we’re currently hooked on the Clouseau, with bourbon, fig, and plum bitters), fresh breadbasket, and smart service all work to create one of the most harmonious dining experiences around.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-le-diplomate
30,Bibiana,Italian,$$$,"The departure of chef Nick Stefanelli—who left to open his own venture, Masseria—has brought fresh energy and talent to Ashok Bajaj’s stylish osteria. Chef Jake Addeo arrives by way of notable Italian restaurants in New York and Hong Kong, including stops with Mario Batali and Lidia Bastianich. His kitchen shows deftness with crudos—try hamachi drizzled with fruity olive oil, preserved citrus, and pink peppercorns—and more robust dishes, such as dry-aged duck breast with Italian prunes or velvety noodles in a classic Bolognese. In a hurry? Seek out the warm-hued bar, which pours tasty cocktails mixed with Italian liqueurs and serves a pasta lunch with wine and sorbetto for $18.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-bibiana

These are simple dishes that rely on top-quality ingredients and studious technique. Grazers and adventurous eaters rightly swear by a meal from the changing small-plates roster, such as grilled peppers and anchovies with a glug of olive oil or braised beef meatballs crisped in the fryer. And don’t ignore the beautifully charred pizzas, best ordered with a side of tangy tomato sauce for dunking. Kids and families abound in the downstairs dining room. There’s a quieter space upstairs for stroller-free adults.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-2amys
32,Ananda,Indian,$$,"You’ll have to work to find the place, housed in an unmarked building. The reward is worth it—a grand retreat complete with nine fireplaces and a veranda. What the kitchen is up to isn’t immediately obvious, either. The MO of brothers Keir and Binda Singh is to infuse a farm-to-table ethos into the Indian curry house. That means more herbs, less ghee and yogurt, and lighter, clean flavors.

33,Rice Paper,Vietnamese,$,"Washingtonians are used to waiting in line for places like Rose’s Luxury or Bad Saint. But how about Rice Paper, in the Eden Center? On a recent visit, the line was out the door. On a Monday. At lunch. One of its secrets: about ten cooks in the tiny kitchen—twice as many as that of some similar-size restaurants. The degree of detail in these dishes is testament to the depth of the brigade—the complex saucing in a short-rib clay pot, or the lacy crunch of a rice crepe.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-rice-paper
34,Obelisk,Italian,$$$$,"Today’s dining scene often favors the adventurous (edible insects!), so there’s much that’s deeply pleasurable about Peter Pastan’s 29-year-old tasting room. Tricks are few—plates of burrataare set out for maximum room-temperature creaminess—and hassles are none, thanks to a poised waitstaff who leisurely pace the five-course meal. Linger over the antipasti (also a Pastan strong suit at 2Amys and Etto), the generous wine pairings, and the pastas, such as house-made noodles with squid. To say the cooking is simple doesn’t give the kitchen its due—sourcing the best ingredients and showing skillful restraint is a talent in its own right.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-obelisk

Now get a load of the gyro at Mike Isabella’s Kapnos Taverna—thick slices of roasted lamb, dripping with juice and singing of garlic and fresh oregano, tucked into a flatbread fresh from the grill, and slathered with tzatziki so thick and rich you could envision eating it by the tubful. Isabella is Italian, not Greek, but he got his start at José Andrés’s Zaytinya, and his affection for the cuisine is evident in the bright, zesty dishes that fly out of these kitchens. At Kapnos, meat is dominant. At Kapnos Taverna, in Ballston, fish is the center of the menu. What unites them, however, is more important than what divides them: The ingredients are first-rate, the presentations are dramatic, the flavors pop.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-kapnos-kapnos-taverna/
36,DBGB Kitchen and Bar,"American, French",$$$,"Daniel Boulud hasn’t gotten the wild attention that some of his CityCenterDC neighbors have, from either the press (in the case of Momofuku CCDC) or the Department of Health (Fig & Olive). And despite his sterling reputation, the French-born New York chef’s bistro here opened with more of a flicker than a blaze. Turns out it was just taking its time to settle in. The glassy room still feels more tightly controlled than laissez-faire, but that’s a good thing when it comes to the food, which is more confident than ever. French classics—a textbook coq au vin, a quivering Grand Marnier soufflé—are handled beautifully. But it speaks to the kitchen’s versatility that a link of Thai pork sausage is as much of a pleaser as a fat boudin blanc.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-dbgb-kitchen-bar/
37,Mintwood Place,"American, French",$$$,"Cedric Maupillier led 2015’s most exciting restaurant opening (that’d be Convivial, number four on this list), but his original Adams Morgan bistro isn’t suffering from inattention. This is strapping Franco-American comfort food executed with immaculate care—as evidenced by his burnished, beautifully crisp escargot hushpuppies. The menu changes just enough to keep things interesting. Still, we’re glad Maupillier doesn’t seem willing to part with the stacked beet-and-goat-cheese salad and bacon cheeseburger that have been around since day one. The loud room—woodsy and lined with antique farming tools—has a wonderfully enveloping quality, especially in the dead of winter.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-mintwood-place
38,The Red Hen,Italian,$$,"There’s a wonderful story about Rodin—that when his apprentices praised the hands on one of his sculptures, Rodin proceeded to hack them off. The piece was thus left handless, and declared finished. The moral? No single element should predominate. So it goes here, where the only thing that stands out is the seamlessness with which food, service, and ambience are integrated into a thriving whole. Yes, the pastas are both imaginative and fulfilling, but get a load of the wooden tables and chairs, the most handsome pieces of restaurant furniture in the area. And although the wine list is full of fascinating finds, the dark, laughter-filled room is its own narcotic. Some inconsistencies have cropped up of late, probably a function of the owners’ split attention as they debut another restaurant. We don’t foresee a long-term problem—the place has been too consistent for too long.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-the-red-hen
39,Iron Gate,"Italian, Mediterranean",$$$,"A couple decades ago, the Iron Gate Inn, as it was called, was known for its lovely date-night space and not much else. Now, two years after it was taken over by the Neighborhood Restaurant Group, it’s a destination for its cooking, too. Anthony Chittum excels with the peasanty sides of Greek and Italian cuisine. On the wisteria-covered patio (one of the most romantic spots around, even in winter, when fire pits warm it up), you can graze on small plates such as maple-roasted squash with yogurt, as well as platters of roasted meats. In the dining room, choose from four- and six-course tasting menus. NRG employs a dream team of cocktail and wine gurus, and what’s in your glass is given just as much thought as what’s on your plate.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-iron-gate
40,Ray’s the Steaks,Steaks,$$,"The robust rope of hanger steak at this no-frills steakhouse was the single best steak we’ve had all year. It’s telling that Ray’s puts just as much effort into its cheapest cut as it does into its most expensive, an exceptional 60-day dry-aged côte de boeuf. In business speak, Ray’s is a disruptor, except that 14 years after it sought to break the mold of the bloated, overpriced steakhouse, nobody else has followed. No matter—that just makes Ray’s more singular. In a genre in which spinach and mashed potatoes are costly sides, owner Michael Landrum offers them free of charge. It seems unfathomable that a twosome could leave a steakhouse for less than $100, but it’s eminently possible at Ray’s. And yes, that includes a wedge of the tart Key-lime pie.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-rays-the-steaks
41,Del Campo,"Peruvian, Steaks",$$$$,"Some restaurants have a feminine air, all warm hues and soft textures. Some are decidedly masculine—dark dens where business is transacted. Del Campo is a macho preserve. The sensibility is swaggering—the leather-bound menu, the gargantuan steaks, the confident air of the staff. Heck, even the small plates are big. The name refers to the rustic culture that is to Peru and Uruguay what cowboy culture is to America: a mythos, and a culinary world unto itself. The chef, Victor Albisu, doesn’t merely pay homage to that world—he aims to thread its fireside essence through every item on the menu. The cocktails whisper of smoke, and even the desserts are torched. In between, you can count on strong, assertive flavors to stand up to the char of the grill.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-del-campo
42,The Bombay Club,Indian,$$$,"Ashok Bajaj’s stately first restaurant wears its 28 years well, thanks to stellar service and a genteel ambience, plus touches that are just throwback enough to fit the vibe (tunes from a white piano). Still, for all the supper-clubby qualities, chef Nilesh Singhvi’s cooking tastes present tense. A variety of curries and artful thali tastings proffered on silver trays join seasonal specialties such as squash-stuffed samosas or vigorously seasoned ground-duck kebabs. Even carnivores shouldn’t ignore the vegetarian section, where mushrooms braised in cashew curry and 16-hour dal makhani reinforce the notion that great things develop with time. Desserts run overly sweet, even by Indian standards—try a sorbet or hard-to-find Amrut whisky instead.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-bombay-club/
43,Inferno Pizzeria Napoletana,"Italian, Pizza",$$,"What’s a three-star chef doing running a pizza joint in a Gaithersburg shopping plaza? Having a blast. Tony Conte may have abandoned his post at the Oval Room, but he hasn’t ditched his commitment to top-quality ingredients, nor has he tossed aside his essential approach, which is to create intricate dishes of varying textures and popping flavors. His sunchoke appetizer is deserving of white-glove presentation—the vegetables roasted until they take on the softness of baked potatoes, then hit with Parmesan sauce and toasted hazelnuts. He brings this same care to his thin-crust pizzas. A version with soft egg and truffles is both indulgent and made for quick devouring.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-inferno-pizzeria-napoletana
44,Sushi Sono,"Japanese, Sushi",$$$,"If you’d never been and decided to chance dropping by here on a weekend night without a reservation, you’d encounter a line out the door and you’d probably begin looking around the lakefront complex at other options. The reason to stick it out—or make a reservation—is the consistently high quality of the fish and the skill of the veteran sushi chefs. This is special-occasion sushi, but you might not know it, given the lack of trappings and the absence of ceremonial hush. But one look at the rolls ought to persuade you. Yes, rolls. At most places, they’re convenient excuses to use up tougher, chewier parts of the fish; here, they’re conceived as showstoppers. Pay attention to the specials posted over the sushi bar, where you’ll find rarities and choice cuts.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-sushi-sono
45,Woodberry Kitchen,American,$$$,"The lone Baltimore restaurant on the list is here for a bunch of reasons. These are the big ones: No space in Washington is as charming as this firewood-stacked former mill, and no chef is as fixated on uncovering the culinary histories and honoring the traditions of the Chesapeake region as Spike Gjerde. Many restaurants have latched onto the farm-to-table movement, but Gjerde is a model for it. His kitchen handmakes everything it can, including things you can’t show off in pretty jars, like cornmeal. The menu leans hard on nostalgic kitchen-table fare (chicken and biscuits, turkey pot pie) but it often does so with a wink—the “adolescent greens” salad is served with “keys to the car, broken curfew,” and an Irish coffee arrives with a glassy brûléed-sugar top.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-woodberry-kitchen
46,Thip Khao,Laotian,$,"It’s not as if you have to like insanely spicy food or off-cuts to come here, but you’re going to have a more exciting time if you do. And if you happen to go for both at once, then few restaurants are going to make you happier. Thip Khao is the second restaurant from Seng Luangrath (also behind Bangkok Golden) and intended as a showcase for the pungent, sour, spicy, bright flavors of her native Laos. Laos borders Thailand, but that’s not to say your Thai restaurant experiences will prepare you for this food, particularly those dishes from the “jungle” section of the menu. Offal remains trendy in fine-dining circles, a chance for chest-flexing chefs to show they’re badasses, but we doubt you’ve ever seen the likes of pig ears and intestines so richly exploited for their intensity and depth of flavor.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-thip-khao
47,The Ashby Inn & Restaurant,American,$$$$,"Don’t be fooled by the well-worn beams and creaky wood flooring. The food at this 19th-century inn in the Blue Ridge foothills is thoroughly modern, thanks to chef Patrick Robinson, who recently arrived from Table in DC. Focus on his charcuterie, in the form of razor-thin duck prosciutto and earthy chicken-liver mousse with shallot jam—they pair nicely with the standout list of wines and ciders. At the same time, his kitchen dazzles with more serious fare such as roasted meats and fish. The taproom, with its crackling fireplace, is coziest in winter; the porch dining room’s sweeping meadow view calls in summer. People-watching—Ashby is a favorite hangout for the horse-country set—is fun anytime.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-the-ashby-inn-and-restaurant/
48,Osteria Morini,Italian,$$$,"The Capitol Riverfront area has grown significantly since New York restaurateur Michael White opened a branch of his SoHo osteria there two years ago, though it’s far from fully developed. No matter—Morini possesses the spirit of a full-fledged neighborhood Italian joint. Groups crowd the bar for superb cheese and charcuterie, while the window-wrapped dining room is the place to tuck into executive chef Matt Adler’s robust cooking from the Emilia-Romagna region. Spring for the shareable antipasti—mortadella meatballs are a classic for a reason—though it pays to be selfish when it comes to fresh pastas such as butternut-squash-stuffed pillows with braised-lamb ragu. Homing in on the carbs often yields maximum enjoyment, especially when you include pastry chef Alex Levin’s fabulous desserts or weekend-brunch pastry basket, filled with warm Danish and speck-flecked brioche.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-osteria-morini
49,Restaurant Eve,"American, Filipino",$$$$,"Digging into Filipino “street barbecue” seems odd at Cathal and Meshelle Armstrong’s Old Town restaurant, given its decade-old reputation as a fine-dining destination for Continental cooking with a locavore bent. Still, sisig and kinilaw are all part of the new Eve, which has melded its tasting room and bistro and now serves both à la carte and prix fixe menus—half Filipino and Asian, half Modern European—throughout the jewel-toned 17th-century rowhouse. The split speaks to the owners’ heritages—Meshelle comes from a Filipino family; Cathal, the chef, is from Ireland—and serves as a preview of the pan-Asian restaurant they hope to open in Southwest DC. Though Cathal’s passion for both cultures comes through on individual dishes, the collision of cuisines gave us whiplash when it came to ordering. Our advice: Stick to one side of the menu. Tables can contentedly linger over a family-style Filipino tasting ($65 a person) or equally delicious Western dishes, such as squash agnolotti with smoked ricotta and sage. Co-owner, sommelier, and cocktail man Todd Thrasher deftly pairs beverages with both.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-restaurant-eve
50,The Dabney,American,$$$,"Few kitchens are equipped with 19th-century cookbooks or a Colonial-style hearth, but that’s just part of the reason the Dabney has set itself apart in its three-month existence. Chef Jeremiah Langhorne—who left Charleston’s lauded McCrady’s to build his Shaw restaurant—aspires to do for the Mid-Atlantic what mentor Sean Brock has done for Southern cuisine. We’ve found the greatest satisfaction in exploring the smaller plates, including toasty sweet-potato rolls with pepper jelly, Duke’s mayo, and pork belly, or buttermilk biscuits stacked with fried eggs and foie gras. Langhorne does double duty as pastry chef with aplomb, leaving us to wonder why no one thought of an apple crumble with Angostura-bitters ice cream sooner.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-the-dabney
51,Momofuku CCDC,"American, Pan-Asian, Ramen",$$,"No restaurant opening of 2015 was more anticipated than this spinoff of David Chang’s Momofuku brand. It would be hard for any restaurant to live up to such immense expectations, particularly an outpost of empire with an absentee chef/owner. And while there are dishes that will have you marveling at Chang’s ability to make fast food feel like fine dining, you’ll also encounter the rough edges endemic to high-volume operations where the boss isn’t always looking—a dish that needs more fine-tuning, a presentation that comes across as more tossed off than labored upon. But Chang, a Northern Virginia native, is often maniacal in his quest for perfection. So keep an eye on the place over the coming year as he introduces new dishes and phases out some of the sure things associated with his other spots. In other words, as in 2015, no restaurant will be more talked about.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-momofuku-ccdc
52,The Restaurant at Patowmack Farm,"American, Modern",$$$$,"A visit to this Loudoun County farm isn’t a grand getaway in the vein of say, the Inn at Little Washington. That’s not a knock—instead, this is a more low-key place, a chance to ascend a hill; breathe in the clear, country air; and watch the sun slip over the horizon. It’s also, and not least, an opportunity to sample Tarver King’s experimental tasting menus, often constructed around the bounties of the farm. (On Thursdays, a simpler à la carte menu is served.) If some of the tricks seem extraneous—burning an autumn leaf to give a soup the scent of the woods—and the cooking tends to put too much of a premium on the pig, King is nearly always interesting. And when he finds expression in dishes conceived to deliver visceral pleasure, as in a fried hen with creamed rice, the drive seems well worth it: creativity and comfort, when so often these days you’re asked to choose.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-the-restaurant-at-patowmack-farm
53,Etto,"Italian, Pizza",$$,"Celery salad. It sounds like the opposite of fun, right? But leave it to Peter Pastan—a master of elevating even the simplest ingredients at 2Amys and Obelisk—to make it the thing we can’t stop coming back for at this pine-floored slip of a pizza place. The secrets? Three kinds of celery, which make for fantastic crunch, plus a hefty dose of pecorino and lemon. Your best move is to treat dinner as a snackfest of cured meats, cheeses, and small plates from the chalkboard menu (such as a fabulous eggplant Parm or a bowl of clams in sherry butter), then maybe finish with a pizza. The hearty crusts are made with house-milled flour, lightly charred, and sparingly topped.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-etto
54,Zaytinya,"Greek, Lebanese, Turkish",$$,"It’s been 14 years since José Andrés opened his Mediterranean mezze house, though you wouldn’t guess it from the crowds that still pack the lofty space. Chef de cuisine Michael Costa keeps palates engaged with the roster of creative Greek, Turkish, and Lebanese dishes. The menu of more than 60 small plates can make for a generous or slightly uneven dining experience, depending on how you order, though real misfires are rare and tables can forgo decision-making altogether and opt for the chef’s tasting ($55 a person). Our à la carte approach: Start with the stellar spreads and breads—try hummus scattered with ground lamb and pickled vegetables—and touch down at least once in each section, feasting on, say, crisp mussels dunked in walnut sauce, juicy kebabs, and local chard stewed with nutty green chickpeas. Peppercorn-scented Zarabanda saison ale, which Andrés helped create, makes a refreshing pairing across the board.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-zaytinya
55,Green Pig Bistro,"American, Southern",$$,"“Play with your food” seems to be the mantra at this Clarendon restaurant tricked out with concrete and brightly colored casserole pots. Many of the exuberant Southern-meets-French-or-Latino dishes are best eaten with your hands. Wedges of custardy cornbread, steamy in their iron skillet, are waiting to be dipped in maple butter. Buffalo ribs get swiped in rich blue-cheese sauce. And a ramekin of snails and mushrooms arrives with toast for sopping the juices. If you’re missing your knife and fork, a good New York strip with marrow butter and a crispy pork shank with plantains can get you reacquainted.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-green-pig-bistro
56,Ghibellina,"Italian, Pizza",$$,"The secret is out about this darkly minimalist restaurant’s happy hour, which lasts from 4 to 6:30 weekdays and starts at 3 on weekends. It’s not limited to booze: You can dig into the kitchen’s terrific thin-crust pies at a deep discount. Perhaps because of this, Ghibellina’s dining room is comparatively under the radar. That’s your gain on busy 14th Street nights or anytime you have a hankering for simple, olive-oil-and-herb-heavy Italian fare. Grilled meats come out particularly well, and the half chicken—cooked under a brick until its skin is extra-crispy—is worth a visit all by itself.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-ghibellina
57,Baby Wale,American,$$,"This is where Tom Power lets his hair down. His neighboring Corduroy is formal and elegant, with nary a note to be heard over the sound system. Here, in this high-ceilinged den, go-go music percolates and the chef works in a playfully casual vein, turning out, say, a foot-long griddled hot dog tucked into a seeded roll and draped with sauerkraut. There’s finesse to go with the fun. Power is a master soup maker, and if his elegant tomato version is on the menu, you’d be remiss for not starting there. The signature among the big plates is his faux rib eye, fashioned from a cut of beef shoulder and napped with a classical reduction of Burgundy—a.k.a. the best steak sauce around.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-baby-wale
58,Nido,Mediterranean,$$,"Fed up with noisy restaurants? This newcomer has departed from the herd, forgoing exposed brick and dangling bulbs in favor of a warm and soothing dining room pulsing with gentle bossa nova. The mood of a casually sophisticated dinner party is reinforced by Aaron Wright’s Mediterranean dishes, many of which—such as his chicken thigh with lemon, olives, and jus—consist of no more than three elements on a plate. Some, including a luscious Sicilian chickpea purée, might look like something you could whip up at home, but there’s more process to them than you can see. The less-is-more approach might not yield a host of discoveries at the table, but you’re almost assured of a relaxing and rewarding meal. Stick around for dessert.

The menu boasts smartly turned out classics including foie gras terrine, pommes Anna, and duck-leg confit. Apéritifs (like the pleasantly bitter, acid-yellow Suze d’Autrefois) and a long list of French wines with excellent by-the-glass offerings mean the crowd at the bar is often three deep.

60,Smokehouse Live,"American, Barbecue",$,"How does a barbecue joint crack the top 100? Start with the bark on the ribs, roasts, and short ribs—thick, and black as cinder: a sign of real skill on the pit master’s part. The interiors are just as impressive: the rosy pink of these luscious meats evidence of a deep, slow penetration of smoke. Many ’cue-joint sides are afterthoughts; not these. When it comes to the pickles (cured in Catoctin Creek Distillery whiskey barrels), collards, and baked grits, you see the same pride and know-how that distinguish the meats. Washington might never become a stop on the barbecue circuit, but in Smokehouse it has a place, like the best nationally, worth the drive.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-smokehouse-live
61,Graffiato,"Italian, Pizza",$$,"When it opened, it was mobbed nightly—more club, it seemed, than restaurant. Now Mike Isabella’s maiden venture has settled into life after stardom. The bad news first: It’s prone to unevenness, and the prices can get up there in a hurry. But there are more than enough thrills to make it worth seeking out. From one direction, the small-plates menu looks to be Mediterranean, from another, Italian—more specifically, Joisey Italian, an idiom that supplies many of the best moments, from a plate of chicken in pepperoni sauce to a pizza topped with provolone and fried calamari. No one would ever confuse Graffiato with a pizzeria, even a boutique one, but the pies are among the finest in the area.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-graffiato

Mine the Korean offerings and you’ll be rewarded with such gems as foie gras dumplings with slow-roasted duck or a wild-boar bowl laden with pork-kimchee rice, filaments of seaweed, and funky gochujang. Over in Cajun country, come-hithers include fried catfish with pickled peppers, Old Bay, and rémoulade plus a fiery jambalaya with cracklings and house-made sausage.

Frying is at a level far above other Thai restaurants (and other restaurants in general). The famed yum watercress salad—with its crispy bits of greens, shrimp, squid, cashew, and shallot tossed with spicy lime juice—tastes like a fritto misto gone Southeast Asian. Yum pla korb ramps up shards of crunchy fish with scallions, lemongrass, and lime. And boneless duck with a shower of chilies and basil is beautifully caramelized.

But why think only oppositionally? Hank’s is also pretty great for a light meal after a movie, or when you happen to have brought together a group of varying tastes and needs and find yourself desperate. The selection of oysters changes daily, the clam chowder rings true, the po’ boys overflow with beautifully fried shrimp and oysters, and the crabcakes (at a time, unfortunately, of diminishing returns on the scene) are reliably light and sweet. The best approach is to cobble together a meal from parts rather than order an entrée—big plates are iffier bets—and to drink with gusto (the bartenders know their stuff, and the beer list is stocked with goodies).",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-hanks-oyster-bar

Customers hunker on box-like benches, sipping beer to the tune of Jay-Z and a constant sizzling from the kitchen’s woks, which sear vegetables or add a roasted flavor to broth swirled in the pan. You won’t go wrong with any of the five styles of ramen, including a delicate shio (salt broth) and an earthy mugi-miso, swimming with springy noodles, bean sprouts, scallions, soy-marinated egg, and roasted and ground pork (the meatless version is excellent, too).

None, however, is quite like Crane & Turtle, which might easily have been an exercise in hipster self-congratulation—an expensive French-Japanese restaurant in a formerly working-class neighborhood—but instead seems so genuine and charming that you root for it. Makoto Hamamura’s brand of fusion, weaving the flavors and traditions of his native Japan with French techniques, is oddly (and unfortunately) out of fashion in this mash-up-mad food culture of ours. Occasionally, a dish comes across as more idea-in-process than fully realized vision, but the best plates feel both creative and rewarding.

But a generation of chefs apprenticed under his watchful gaze, among them his most recent protégé, Amy Brandwein, who learned more than a thing or two about pasta making. Let other chefs send out the expected tagliatelle and chittarra—Brandwein’s lineup includes such obscurities as reginette (crown-like cups containing various stuffings of seafood, including, in her rendition, scallop and cod) and casonsei (small, Lombardy-style ravioli filled with beef, chard, and raisins). The impressive thing is that she can take a pasta you might never have heard of and turn it into something just as comforting as a soulful bowl of spaghetti.

Number one: soups such as the Toki Classic, packed with noodles, mustard greens, pickled ginger, a sous-vide egg, and an unapologetic quantity of pork. Though bowls are beyond filling, don’t ignore starters like the fried-chicken bao buns.

The menu can be tricky to navigate—it throws together Peruvian standards such as lomo saltado with dishes that bear a heavy Chinese or Japanese influence. Our advice: Get one of the excellent (and massive) fried-rice bowls and accent it with an array of dumplings, ceviches, and sushi rolls made with potato instead of rice.

At night, the lights go down (though the sound system stays tuned to ’90s hip-hop and metal) and chef/owner Mike Isabella’s crew cranks out a more ambitious roster of Italian pastas and roasts. The $40 prix fixe menu—which begins with a generous meat-and-cheese slate—is a killer deal, but you can go à la carte as well. Even if you have kale fatigue, don’t overlook the cavolo nero salad, softened with tangy yogurt-tahini dressing. It’s one of the best plates of greens we’ve had in months.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-g-by-mike-isabella
72,Chez Billy and Chez Billy Sud ,French,$$$,"Eric and Ian Hilton’s sibling bistros look completely unrelated. The original Petworth location is cozy and creaky, while Georgetown’s Chez Billy Sud possesses an airier elegance, all pale-green walls and gilded mirrors. Though the Hiltons are masters of creating alluring ambience at places that include the Brixton and the Gibson, chefs Brendan L’Etoile and Lawrence DiJoseph bring delicious substance to the equation, too. Their menus convey a passion for the classics, including snails in garlic-parsley butter, crisp-skinned duck confit, and bright-tasting trout grenobloise. Though the offerings vary—Petworth leans rustic, Sud draws more from the sea—plenty of crossover exists, including one can’t-miss dessert: Paris-Brest, a confection of praline cream sandwiched between swirls of pastry.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-chez-billy-chez-billy-sud/
73,Peter Chang,Chinese,$$,"The Szechuan master chef who inspired a Deadhead-like following as he hopscotched from restaurant to restaurant in the American South has settled down and built an empire. These two dining rooms represent his incursion into the DC market. Chang’s greatness is not in doubt, but with expansion comes a streamlined menu for easy replication and a fleet of chefs who lack his deftness. Will you taste the magic that turned Chang into a kind of culinary folk hero? Some nights yes, some nights no. Stick to the greatest hits—the bamboo fish, cumin-scented and tucked into a woven basket; the mapotofu—and you improve your odds of getting a Szechuan meal of unparalleled lightness, depth, and punch.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-peter-chang/
74,Sushiko,"Japanese, Sushi",$$,"A vegan omakase tasting is one of many signs that Washington’s oldest sushi spot has evolved and is flourishing at its Chevy Chase location. (The Glover Park original, which opened 40 years ago, has shuttered.) You’ll still find immaculate sushi and sashimi—note the specials flown in from Japan—plus chef’s tastings at the sushi bar and excellent soups such as smoked-mussel miso broth. It’s worth exploring the expanded small-plates menu. We’re fans of the yellowtail crudo with grapefruit, miso-mustard duck, and addictive popcorn-style shrimp with yuzu aïoli.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-sushiko
75,Equinox,American,$$$$,"Time was, big chunks of protein were an emblem of upscale cuisine. These days, though, famous chefs are moving away from meat and toward vegetables: Witness the popularity of José Andrés’s Beefsteak (named for the tomato). Now Todd and Ellen Gray are getting into the act at their 17-year-old restaurant—roughly half the dinner menu is now vegan. And it works, most of the time. Even carnivores should explore the creative “plant-based selections” —we loved crispy sherry-glazed cauliflower with roasted spaghetti squash and a wild-mushroom pot au feu. Then again, soy-based chestnut velouté doesn’t have the same ethereal quality sans cream, and other options beckon from the menu’s omnivorous side, such as perfectly seared scallops or pappardelle in a lustrous Bolognese. Thankfully, all dishes can be ordered in half or full portions, inviting diners to dabble where they please.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-equinox
76,Et Voila!,"Belgian, French",$$,"Cheek-by-jowl tables and the happy buzz of conversation give this dining room the feel of a Montparnasse hangout. And while the menu includes nods to the City of Light such as duck confit and profiteroles, it skews toward the native cuisine of Belgian chef/owner Claudio Pirollo. That means mussels are reliably plump (we like the version with garlic and saffron) and frites nicely crunchy. Despite the cramped quarters, there’s a sense of wit to the place. Oversize cutlery doubles as art, and that luminous clock is actually a projection.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-et-voila
77,Trapezaria,Greek,$$,"In an unabashedly white-collar city like Washington, there aren’t a whole lot of blue-collar restaurants of worth—places with good food, moderate prices, and little pretense. The appeal of Trapezaria is that it occupies a point on the spectrum almost equidistant from fine dining and diner. Tablecloths grace the tables, but none of the plates that find their way to those tables is particularly pretty. And that’s as it should be—you’re here for rib-sticking satisfaction, not style. The dips, such as the taramasalata, all pop; the avgolemono is lemony and comforting; and the bigger plates, including the marvelous fried cod with skordalia—a kind of Greek fish and chips—have an assured simplicity.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-trapezaria
78,Ardeo & Bardeo,American,$$$,"DC’s dining scene would be stronger if there were more neighborhood restaurants like this Cleveland Park bistro. It’s casual enough to drop into for a solo glass of wine and a juicy burger, buzzy during prime time when you want to split some charcuterie with a date before hitting the Uptown Theater, and well suited to impressing food-loving friends (try the pasta with tender lamb-neck ragu). Though candlelit and moody at night, the space brightens for weekend brunch, still a top option with two courses and unlimited bubbles for $29.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-ardeo-bardeo
79,Wildwood Kitchen,Mediterranean,$$$,"Robert Wiedmaier has gone Mediterranean at this upscale-strip-mall bistro, the coziest dining room of the 11 in his empire. Retro lamps give off a rosy glow, while images of lush leaves provide a vivid pop of color. “Vivid” describes the cooking, too. Merguez is punctuated with spiced chickpeas and chermoula, an herby condiment from North Africa. And the beef carbonnade of Wiedmaier’s Belgian eateries morphs into an exotic dish of harissa-glazed beef enlivened with black garlic. It’s enough to make us wish we could talk him into opening a Wildwood in our neighborhood, too.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-wildwood-kitchen
80,L’Auberge Chez François and Jacques’ Brasserie,French,$$$$,"French bistro classics are having a moment, but it’s tougher to find the more opulent showpieces—Châteaubriand, Dover sole—that once defined Washington-area fine dining. Unless, that is, you’re at Jacques Haeringer’s cottage in Great Falls. His menu, which includes many nods to his late father, François, who founded the restaurant in 1954, dazzles not with innovation but with small comforts: The toasty garlic bread that kicks off the meal. The powdered-sugar-dusted soufflés that wind them down. In between, six-course parades of soul-satisfying cooking. In the event you’re not celebrating an anniversary or promotion,—which might place you in the minority at L’Auberge—Jacques’ Brasserie offers an à la carte menu and doesn’t require reservations or a coat and tie.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-lauberge-chez-francois-jacques-brasserie/
81,The Partisan,American,$$$,"The menu says “serves 4 to 6,” but what’s a number when you and a pal are bent on getting the pig feast this dining room is known for? Roasted pig’s head, sausage, smoked bone marrow, pig-ear salad—it’s all part of the bacchanal. (Just take home lots of leftovers.) Still, there are plenty of other ways to partake in the meaty thrills. Dabble in Nathan Anda’s charcuterie menu—we go for the bacon liverwurst, Negroni-inspired salami, and beef heart with bourbon-soaked peppercorns. Or head for bigger plates such as mezcal-braised lamb ribs and pork-shank confit. Don’t overlook the vegetables and smattering of seafood—a welcome counterpoint to all the fatty stuff.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-partisan/
82,Urban Butcher,American,$$,"A decade ago, the only time you ever saw charcuterie was in a French bistro. Now curing meats has become one of the ways talented chefs demonstrate their chops. This combination butcher shop/restaurant from Raynold Mendizabal has emerged as one of the area’s foremost destinations to sample the art—take a bite of coppa or bresaola from one of his marvelous boards and you’ll have tasted more flavor than some restaurants can pack into an entire meal. The surest route to a good time is to order a selection of meats to start, linger over them with a glass of wine, then return to the menu to accessorize your meal.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-urban-butcher
83,Brasserie Beck,Belgian,$$$,"Robert Wiedmaier’s soaring space is as charming as ever, from the clocks evoking European rail stations to the gorgeous display of fresh catches from around the world. The kitchen privileges familiarity over novelty, while the strapping portions of bistro cooking speak to Belgian traditions—as does the hearty rusticity of this sprawling menu of carbonnades, braised meats, and mussels. The moules frites come drenched with a rich Bolognese—a brilliant stroke. The wine list is excellent, but the emphasis is on beers, and the list of Belgian tripels, sours, and the like is encyclopedic.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-brasserie-beck
84,Pearl Dive Oyster Palace,"American, Seafood, Southern",$$,"With its chipped-paint walls, this weathered dining room looks as if it’s been here for decades. In fact, it’s only five years old, but when it comes to the rapidly changing scene along the 14th Street corridor, that practically makes it a granddaddy. The menu hasn’t changed much along the way—the barbecue shrimp are as buttery as ever, the frying for po’ boy fillings is expert, and the boozy pecan pie remains the best around. True to the place’s name, oyster fans will find much to like. The list culls the best varieties from both coasts (including sweet Kusshis from British Columbia and bracing Beavertails from Rhode Island) and serves them on ice and in decadent preparations such as the Tchoupitoulas, with tasso ham, corn, and crab.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-pearl-dive-oyster-palace
85,PassionFish,Seafood,$$$,"Jeff Tunks’s Reston seafood palace has a shimmering new sibling inside a downtown Bethesda condo building. Few other restaurants in the area serve pescatarians so well, and the kitchens at both locations—overseen by longtime chef de cuisine Chris Clime—excel with a wide range of styles, including New England-inspired fry-ups, ceviche, and sushi. (In Bethesda, a dedicated sushi chef turns out terrific rolls.) The raw bar is a particular strength. The Big Daddy—a three-tiered tower overflowing with Wellfleet clams, oysters, jumbo-lump crab cocktail, and a whole lobster—is one of the best excuses there is to celebrate.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-passionfish
86,La Limeña,"Peruvian, Seafood",$,"Sure, you can find a very good lomo saltado, that happy pileup of marinated tri-tip, onions, and tomatoes over a mound of French fries, and the pollo a la brasa is good, too, but do yourself a favor and suspend your meat-centered menu-gazing when you drop by Emma Perez’s strip-mall storefront. The measure of any good Peruvian restaurant—and this is one—is not in the meats; it’s in its preparations of seafood and potatoes. The best reason to come here is to sup on ceviches and tiraditos—bright, clean treatments of fish and shellfish cooked only with lime juice so as to emphasize the freshness and texture of the product. As befits a culinary culture with more than 700 kinds of potato, the humble spud is well represented, from causa, a kind of potato napoleon, to the papa rellena, an oblong ball of mashed potatoes encasing an empanada-like filling.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-la-limena
87,Doi Moi,"Thai, Vietnamese",$$,"Thip Khao’s green-papaya salad and Little Serow’s fried tofu are well-known bucket-list items for capsaicin addicts, but the tear-inducing mushroom-and-herb salad at this bright-white Thai/Vietnamese small-plates hangout deserves a spot right alongside them. Much of the menu is singeing, and the trick is finding a good balance—knowing that fluffy mounds of crab fried rice and giant pork buns are your friends next to the curries and chili-laced larb salad. So, too, the wine list, which is packed with tongue-soothing values from Germany and Austria. We just wish we could say the same about the servers, who during multiple visits ranged from unhelpful to absentee.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-doi-moi
88,Ripple,American,$$$,"Chef Marjorie Meek-Bradley has expanded her presence well beyond Cleveland Park in the past year, competing on Top Chef and preparing for an upcoming sandwich joint at DC’s convention center. Thankfully, her home-base kitchen doesn’t feel forsaken and is producing a lively lineup of dishes suited for a range of dining experiences. Settle into the bar/lounge for a smoky mezcal cocktail and the extensive variety of cheeses and charcuterie (try the house-made rabbit rillettes) or take a table in the red-hued, pleasantly hushed dining room. Oft-changing plates run eclectic—we fell hard for the excellent Indian-spiced carrot soup, roasted bone marrow with chimichurri, and best-of-both-worlds chicken (it’s roasted and fried). Still, it was tough not to fill up on the complimentary milk bread dusted with everything-bagel seasoning.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-ripple
89,Taqueria el Mexicano,Mexican,$,"Okay, so the dining room looks about as inviting as a 7-Eleven. But so what when the mole tastes this rich with nuts, chilies, and dark chocolate? The rojo for the adobo pork is nearly as good—slice off a hunk of the tender rib meat, tuck it into a nubbly, from-scratch corn tortilla, and drizzle on some of the hot sauce. The sopes, too, are made in-house—order one with braised tongue and savor the way the texture of the thick tortilla and the soft meat nearly approximate each other. Don’t be tempted by the typical Tex-Mex fare, such as tacos and enchiladas, which tend to evince less conviction than the authentically Mexican stuff that owners (and proud Puebla natives) Bernardo and Clara Vargas opened the place to showcase. If there’s a cream pastry in the case up front, grab it when you place your order—the Vargases own the bakery a couple of doors down, and the sweet might not be there when you’re ready for dessert.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-taqueria-el-mexicano
90,BlackSalt ,"American, Seafood",$$$,"Long before market/restaurant hybrids became trendy, chef Jeff Black’s seafood shop and dining room was a destination in the Palisades. Eleven years in, the crowds haven’t waned, though the space has been refreshed with bar-area banquettes and a brighter palette. Seafood—including specialties you can select from ice-laden cases for chefs to prepare—remains the main draw. Chef Mike Huff, who has spent time cooking in Italy’s Campania region, has added a few daily-special fresh pastas to the menu; they join a global lineup that’s strong when touching down in Europe (wood-grilled sardines with garlic-parsley sauce) and Asia (Skuna Bay salmon atop a rice tower). Portions run large and flavors tend to be rich, so it’s worth skipping a small plate and saving room for longtime pastry chef Susan Wallace’s retro sweets.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-blacksalt
91,Lyon Hall,"French, German",$$,"This jammed Clarendon brasserie gracefully straddles the territory between bar and restaurant. There are plenty of twentysomethings here to sip from the groaning roster of boutique wines, Belgian and German beers, ciders, and cocktails. But it’s also a family destination, with swing-set-friendly fare—giant pretzels, terrific house-made hot dogs in poppy-seed buns—that tends to show up on a lot of grownups’ plates, too. House-made charcuterie and mussel pots are ideal for communal eating, as are platters of sausages and pork belly piled on top of kraut and spaetzle and garnished with tart lingonberries. In the mood for something lighter? Go for the grilled sea bass, boosted by zippy green-olive vinaigrette.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-lyon-hall
92,Compass Rose,International,$$,"Rose Previte’s cozy joint is just half a block off 14th Street, but it feels like a respite. She and her waitstaff—who look imported from the set of Girls—create a friendly, cozy vibe in the elbow-to-elbow rowhouse dining room. (Recently, the back area has been tricked out with a sunset-hued Bedouin tent, where a separate Moroccan menu is served.) In the kitchen, chef Sam Molavi has tightened up a once-scatterbrained small-plates menu devoted to street snacks from around the world. He’s as deft with turning out creamy Japanese octopus fritters as he is with Colombian lamb-neck arepas. To drink, there are bracing cocktails made with obscurities like génépy, an Alpine apéritif.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-compass-rose
93,Nostos,Greek,$$,"Tucked away in a Tysons office park, this white-on-white Greek restaurant runs traditional, which is in many ways an asset—wine-braised lamb shanks are meltingly tender, spreads including smoky eggplant feel light, and fresh catches such as branzino arrive moist and simply dressed with fruity Greek olive oil. The kitchen’s particular strengths come forth in seafood small plates such as sweet shrimp stewed in tomatoes and feta. Don’t be shy about asking for guidance when it comes to the extensive list of Greek wines, yielding a lush Peloponnesian rosé, among other delicious finds.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-nostos
94,Republic,American,$$,"Takoma Park has long been known for loud and lively debate, but until Jeff Black’s Republic arrived two years ago, it had never been known for loud and lively restaurants—the kind where people crowd the bar and the din approximates that of a party at full volume. Few restaurants, including the other five places in Black’s portfolio, have even half as much character as this one, with its boudoir-like red booths, antique brass lamps, and a box radio by the host stand. The greatest rewards are the simplest—a tray of perfectly shucked Skookum oysters from Washington state, a bowl of mussels (its divine tomato broth could stand alone as its own dish, to be soaked up with crusty bread), a shrimp po’ boy to make a New Orleanian forget home. With bigger plates, the cooking tends to lose its clarity. As at all of Black’s restaurants, desserts are a highlight, delivering homey satisfaction.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-republic
95,Ser,Spanish,$$,"The crisp-skinned suckling pig at this Modern Spanish spot is one of the most compelling dishes around. Not just because it’s tasty but because it’s “carved” with the edge of a plate instead of a knife. Co-owner Javier Candon (his partner is Josu Zubikarai, formerly of Taberna del Alabardero) does the deed with both nonchalance and flair. Other offerings—charcuterie and cheese, tapas, and larger plates—don’t have the pomp of the pig, but there are pleasures to be found. Classic small plates such as shrimp with a hit of garlic and cayenne or fried baby eels evoke tapas crawls in Madrid. So, too, the list of wines and sherries and a dining room splashed in Mediterranean oranges and yellows.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-ser
96,Black Market Bistro,American,$$,"Jeff and Barbara Black’s bistro isn’t far from Bethesda, but it has an out-in-the-country vibe. And though it’s a neighborhood gathering spot, it’s also a destination for those seeking a tête-à-tête rather than a scene, along with easy-to-like food. Crackly-crust pizzas (the mushroom-pecorino is terrific) share space with Modern American plates such as a chewy-in-a-good-way hanger steak with chimichurri. Cake lovers will find their happy place—especially if the blackout cake is on the menu. Even though it’s mated with Chantilly cream and chocolate sauce, we amp it up with ice cream.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-black-market-bistro
97,Rus Uz,"Russian, Uzbek",$$,"It’s hard to resist the Vodka Roulette at this Russian-Uzbeki restaurant: ten blind shots, randomly culled from house-infused vodkas. (We’re hooked on the horseradish variety.) But share with friends—otherwise you might have to bail on chef/owner Bakhitiyor Rakhmatulleav’s robustly satisfying cooking. Among the many savory meat-in-dough starters—including good versions of bun-like pirozhki and fried half-moon chebureki—the flaky samsa with spiced lamb is the clear favorite (the restaurant has been known to run out). Uzbeki dishes tend to outshine the Russian offerings, which means that among the bigger plates, you’ll want to focus on manti, pillows of thin dough filled with minced lamb and drizzled with yogurt, or plov,a long-cooked rice dish studded with tender lamb, raisins, and carrots. For those inspired to DIY, the market next door carries many of the fixings for the food—and for infusing vodka.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-rus-uz
98,Passage to India,Indian,$$,"Allow us a moment, please, to praise the thoughtful civility of this dining room: the soft ragas on the sound system, the tables laid with crisp cloth, the sense that you’ve gotten away from it all. None of this would mean very much if it weren’t for the quality of the food, which, when the kitchen is on, has a subtlety and nuance missing in the competition. A curry here isn’t merely an excuse to bring the heat but to treat you to the full range of effects that come from proper, layered spicing. And there are flavors and combinations you simply won’t find anywhere else in the area, with dishes drawn from all across the subcontinent.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-passage-to-india
99,Lupo Verde,Italian,$$$,"With its tucked-away alcoves and ruddy brick walls, this rowhouse is one of the more romantic addresses in the 14th Street corridor. But it’s not just about atmosphere. There are excellent cocktails, especially if you’re a fan of herbal flavors and amari; a prodigious roster of Italian meats and cheeses, including obscurities such as salty Moliterno cheese from Basilicata; and a wealth of fresh pastas. We like to kick things off with cipolla, a grilled onion stuffed with a gooey “fondue” of cheeses studded with olives. Bread comes with it, but it’s the sort of thing that begs for a spoon.",https://www.washingtonian.com/food/restaurantreviews/100-very-best-restaurant-2016-lupo-verde

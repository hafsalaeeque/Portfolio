0,Mela Tandoori Kitchen,Cuisine Indian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"If ""mela"" means ""fair"" in Hindi, then Tandoori Kitchen is aptly named. As fun and lively as a carnival, this welcoming spot sports brightly striped walls and colorful splashes of paint set aglow by stylish pendant lights. Its menu displays a vast litany of eats, and obliging servers are happy to lend a hand with useful recommendations. The overwhelming lunch buffet is a hit among office workers for hot, crispy samosas with sweet tamarind chutney, or fiery tandoori wings baked until smoky and juicy. The area takes a bit of a dive at sunset, but that doesn't curb this kitchen's appeal. Families keep coming to devour huge portions of aloo gobi in an onion-and-tomato masala along with intensely spicy lamb vindaloo-and inevitably leave toting leftovers.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94102-Mela_Tandoori_Kitchen-369063-41102
1,Pläj,Cuisine Scandinavian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"NorCal is short on the Scandinavian-inspired fare that's all the rage right now, so it's no wonder why Bay Area foodies flock to this upscale spot. Steps from the opera, symphony, and ballet, Plaj has caught on like wildfire with the pre-theater crowd, who congregate at the linen-topped tables and cozy bar for a taste of Californian cuisine mingled with Nordic flair. Swedish-born Chef/owner Roberth Sundell offers smart riffs on classic dishes, from a tender duo of potato dumplings accented with brown butter, caramelized onions, and bacon to deep-red seared elk medallions set in a woodsy juniper jus and accented by tart lingonberries. For dessert, a parfait-like take on princess cake, with layers of raspberry, sponge cake, and marzipan, is worthy of royalty.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94102-Plaj-372858-41102
2,Jardinière,Cuisine Californian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"For a memorable night on the town, don your best dress, find a hand to hold, and head to this longtime favorite-tinged with a sense of bygone romance. Stop off at the circular bar and join the well-heeled couples sipping cocktails pre- or post-opera. Prime seats on the upstairs balcony overlook the bustling lower level, and stunning arched windows show off views of the street. Approachable, seasonal dishes abound on Jardinière's menu, from tender tajarin pasta with morel mushrooms and butter to a Mediterranean-inspired duo of lamb belly and shoulder with fresh fava beans and smoked yogurt sauce. Indecisive sweet tooths will thrill to the bonne bouche, an array of candies, cookies, small cakes, and profiteroles that makes a striking conclusion.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94101-Jardiniere-121888-41102
3,Brenda's,Cuisine Southern,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Big portions and even bigger flavors are the draw at this taste of New Orleans, helmed by Louisiana-bred Chef/owner Brenda Buenviaje. Chicken étouffée offers a smoky, dark roux packed with vegetables, while a flawless muffuletta is packed with savory meat, provolone, and spicy olive salad (it's great with an ice-cold Abita beer). Sweet and salty golden beignets, filled with cheesy crawfish or molten Ghirardelli chocolate, could be a meal on their own. The Tenderloin address is rough around the edges, but Brenda's interior is quite lovely, with a light-filled dining room, bright murals, and high ceilings. Count on a wait here now that the secret is out, particularly at lunch and brunch. Or, check out the equally delicious sequel, Brenda's Meat & Three.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94102-Brenda_s-436461-41102
4,Boxing Room,Cuisine Southern,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"A trip to the real-life Big Easy may be short on veggies (unless fried okra counts), but northern California balances the Cajun and Creole indulgences on offer at this lively restaurant, leading to dishes like a spicy-sweet fig and arugula salad with spiced pecans and pan-seared goat cheese. Casual and sleek, it draws business types for lunch and happy hour, when they cluster around the oyster bar with beers and boiled peanuts. All the classics can be found here including gumbo, fried alligator, and a perfect jambalaya studded with spicy andouille and tender roasted duck. The simple and high-ceilinged dining room encourages lingering-as does the airy angel-food ""strawberry shortcake"" with lemon verbena ice cream and tangy whipped yogurt.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94102-Boxing_Room-338320-41102
5,Absinthe,Cuisine Mediterranean,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"The original colonist of Hayes Valley's now-bustling restaurant row, this ""green fairy"" still has plenty of sparkle, thanks to its timeless brasserie atmosphere and classic French- and Mediterranean-inspired menu. Even a lowly chicken breast gets the magic treatment here, with crunchy skin, perfectly wilted lacinato kale, and swirls of luscious Bourbon-yam purée. The same goes for a little gem lettuce salad with fine herbs dressed in a red wine-shallot vinaigrette. Perched between formal and casual, the restaurant draws relaxed alfresco lunchers with dogs by day and stylish symphony or opera patrons by night. In either incarnation, it's a lovely place for a cocktail-a few may earn you a wink from those fairies, flitting across the dining room mural.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94102-Absinthe-121884-41102
6,Monsieur Benjamin,Cuisine French,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Chef Corey Lee's take on timeless bistro cuisine is as sleek and striking as the space it's served in. Fit for the cover of a magazine, this black-and-white dining room's minimalist, yet intimate décor is trumped only by its piece de resistance: an exhibition kitchen where you'll find the meticulous brigade of cooks hard at work, producing impressively authentic French food. Begin with the pâté de Campagne, enhanced with liver and shallots and presented with strong mustard, cornichons, and country bread. The Arctic char amandine is excellent, dressed with fragrant beurre noisette and served over a bed of crispy haricot verts and sunchoke. For a sweet and fruity finish, purists will delight in the dessert menu's crêpe façon gâteau.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94102-Monsieur_Benjamin-445370-41102
7,Alta CA,Cuisine Californian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Though this hip techie gathering place is relaxed at lunch-it wouldn't be uncommon to see diners pecking away at their laptops-it's the place to be after work. There, in the shadow of the Twitter building across the street and beneath a massive floor-to-ceiling shelf loaded with bottles, sharply attired CEOs and hoodied engineers congregate for cocktails at the triangular bar. The Eastern European-influenced menu kicks off with drinking snacks like wispy, savory beef tendon puffs, then moves into hearty plates like pierogies, beef stroganoff, and house-cured pastrami stuffed inside soft, chewy bialys. And when it comes to dessert, even the most plugged-in programmers will put away their iPhones for a bite of the creamy lemon and poppy seed sundae.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94102-Alta_CA-436460-41102
8,Rusty's Southern,Cuisine Southern,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"In the hard-charging techie wilds of San Francisco, homesick transplants can find Southern comfort at this Tenderloin newbie, which eschews fine-dining frills for rib-sticking simplicity. Its environs are a bit sketchy after dark, but that doesn't deter the young and stylish crowds, who swill craft beers at the front bar and congregate in groups in the casual, wood-accented dining room. Rustic and homey treats arrive in abundant portions: tangy, smoky Brunswick stew is loaded with pork, chicken, collards, lima beans and tomatoes, while expertly brined fried chicken is encased in a crunchy, golden-brown breading. For a snack, the fluffy fried hush puppies come equipped with a decadent pimento-ranch dipping sauce, and pair nicely with an icy sweet tea.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94109-Rusty_s_Southern-471901-41102
9,Rich Table,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","Its rustic-chic décor, highlighting reclaimed and raw wood, gives Rich Table a farmhouse feel, and the crowds that pack it are equally shabby-sleek. Reserve early or expect a long wait, as there's serious competition for seats that quickly fill with young professionals in designer casualwear. The contemporary American food from Chef/owners Evan and Sarah Rich is highly engaging with menu mainstays like crispy sardine chips and porcini-salted doughnuts set alongside a warm raclette dip. Snap peas are arranged beside grapefruit segments, pecans, and nasturtium blossoms; while seasonal mains include a tangy strawberry gazpacho topped with crunchy chicken skin and burrata. Also irresistable is a smoky pork chop posed atop wheat berries and pork-garum jus.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94102-Rich_Table-401078-41102
10,Domo,Cuisine Japanese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"This Hayes Valley sushi joint is roughly the size of a shoebox, with only a dozen stools and a pair of sidewalk tables to choose from. Reservations aren't accepted, which means there's almost always a wait (make the most of it by perusing the daily specials on the mirror). Once seated, you'll likely have a few hungry diners eyeing your spot, so don't bring a group or plan to linger. For your trouble, you'll be rewarded with straightforward, high-quality sushi, whether you opt for simply prepared salmon and albacore nigiri (with well-seasoned rice) or the elaborate Domo roll, a baked California version with salmon, scallops, mayo, unagi glaze, tobiko, and scallions. To spice things up, try the lemon juice- and jalapeño-spiked hamachi maki.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94102-Domo-233156-41102
11,Huxley,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Tattooed industry types can't get enough of this itsy-bitsy Tenderloin bistro, where the industrious young chef prepares every plate herself in the slip of a kitchen. With its warm wood surfaces, art deco accents, and vintage etched mirrors, it's an engaging place to pull up a counter seat-you'll feel like she's cooking just for you. The menu is all about high-quality American comfort fare, like avocado toast with a creamy uni mousse and umami-rich nori powder; tender, caramelized pork belly tossed with sprouted lentils and pea tendrils; and a superb chicken pot pie, its flaky, buttery crust infused with black pepper. Desserts are limited, but a simple buttermilk-vanilla ice cream with caramelized honeycomb candy hits all the right notes.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94109-Huxley-471904-41102
12,Tadu,Cuisine Ethiopian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"Strength in numbers is the way to go when planning a visit to this charming Ethiopian newcomer: its neighborhood is one in which you won't want to walk alone, and besides, you'll need all the help you can get to tackle the hearty portions, all served family-style here. Despite its bleak environs, Tadu's cheerful décor and friendly, engaging staff make for a very warm welcome. Rev up your palate with the spicy, golden-brown sambussas, filled with earthy lentils and caramelized onions. Then go full-throttle with the kitfo, a zippy mixture of ground beef, onion, jalapeño, and Ethiopian spices. There's plenty of fluffy, slightly sour injera to mellow the burn: you can even enjoy it cooked with spices and vegetables in the delightful firfir.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94102-Tadu-471902-41102
13,Zuni Café,Cuisine Mediterranean,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Over thirty years young and still thriving as if it were newborn, locals and visitors remain drawn to this SF institution, famous for its laid-back California vibe and great, locally sourced eats. This iconic space embraces its unique shape, and is styled with bold artwork-covered walls, a copper bar counter, and wood-burning oven sending out delightful pizzas and filling the room with mouthwatering aromas. Given its ace location, Zuni makes for a divine lunch destination-and proof is in the many business folk, trendy ladies-who-lunch, and tourists that fill its tables midday. Menu treasures include sliced persimmon scattered with shaved Jerusalem artichoke and baby arugula leaves, tailed by toothsome artisanal rigatoni clutching fragrant lamb sugo.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94101-Zuni_Cafe-121890-41102
14,Tycoon,Cuisine Thai,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"Its location in the gritty Tenderloin doesn't offer much in terms of ambience, but this Thai newcomer makes up for it with flavorful, fragrant cooking that's a cut above the standard pad Thai racket. You'll swoon for the utterly perfect sai ua, juicy, smoky pork sausages bursting with the aromas of makrut lime, lemongrass, and chili, and the delectable pad ped, a spicy coconut-milk curry loaded with piquant green peppercorns, tender tofu, eggplant, and bell pepper. For true culinary adventurers, there's a small selection of Laotian dishes, like pad mee lao or thin rice noodles with chicken, fresh mint, and a splash of earthy black bean sauce. Also notable is the unusual and authentic drink selection, which includes vibrant pandan and chrysanthemum juices.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94109-Tycoon-471903-41102
15,AQ,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Like its once-sketchy, increasingly tech-centric SoMa corridor, this chic Californian restaurant is aiming for the stars-and even if it doesn't always succeed, it's certainly never a dull ride. Whether you opt for the four-course or tasting menu, you'll be wowed by flavor combos that are always intriguing and often breathtaking: think silky-sweet scallop crudo with white sesame and pineapple, earthy beets with snap peas and lavender ice cream, and black cod with clam butter. AQ's hyperseasonal menus are gently accented by a quarterly décor shakeup; depending on the time of year, you'll find cherry blossoms or fall leaves accenting the sleek, neutral space. Be sure to come early to enjoy one of the exceptional cocktails at the front bar.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94103-AQ-365867-41102
16,Una Pizza Napoletana,Cuisine Pizza,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"In keeping with owner Anthony Mangieri's monastic devotion to the perfect pie, Una Pizza Napoletana is a spare space, housed in a chilly former garage on an industrial corner of SoMa. The vibe is completely casual yet alluring with crowds riveted by the altar-a tiled turquoise oven, where Mangieri stretches dough and deftly coaxes the crackling wood fire to produce his perfect pies. Their blistered and puffy crusts sport a delicious char as well as an addictively chewy texture thanks to tangy fermentation. Waits are long, but the hassle is well worth it after one bite of the Filetti, slathered with creamy buffalo mozzarella and juicy cherry tomatoes. Mangieri is unquestionably a master of his craft, and his pies are a cut above local competition.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94103-Una_Pizza_Napoletana-325326-41102
17,Modern Thai,Cuisine Thai,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"""Modern"" is a bit of a misnomer, as this tropical Thai retreat actually feels like a step back in time with its whitewashed colonial façade, linen-topped tables, and rattan chairs. But the anachronism also applies to the portions (incredibly generous) and prices (incredibly reasonable), making it a favorite for nine-to-fivers seeking an affordable lunch break. Sweet and spicy Thai flavors abound here, from warm salads of glass noodles and minced chicken with a fish sauce-lime vinaigrette to comforting noodle soups like the khao soy, with chicken and egg noodles in a rich yellow coconut curry. And the MT sundae, a combo of coconut ice cream, sugar palm fruit, red beans, and jackfruit, is a refreshing dessert perfect for lunchtime dining.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94109-Modern_Thai-271330-41102
18,1601 Bar & Kitchen,Cuisine Sri Lankan,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","The flavors of India and Asia infuse the creative dishes at this quiet winner, which blends Eastern and Western ingredients to arrive at its very own delicious concoctions. A decidedly untraditional lamprais might stuff a classically French bacon-wrapped rabbit loin, toasted buckwheat, and eggplant curry into a banana leaf. Meanwhile, the halibut ""ceviche"" is more like a flavored sashimi, with hints of coconut milk and rings of serrano chilies. The sleek, contemporary space with its wraparound windows, lovely art, and slate walls, is a perfect showcase for the food. Dine solo at the bar with a bittersweet Dubonnet sangria, or come with a group to share dishes and bottles of wine at the communal table-the polished staff makes either experience enjoyable.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94103-1601_Bar_Kitchen-401080-41102
19,Pampalasa,Cuisine Filipino,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"""Pampalasa"" is Tagalog for ""to add flavor,"" and that's precisely what this new Filipino restaurant has done to this industrial stretch of Folsom Street. With sunny yellow walls and lots of Filipino artwork, it has a casual, island-party vibe. Adding to the fun, you're encouraged to dine kamayan-style (with your hands); there's a sink in the center of the room for easy cleanup. Kick things off with the tocino sliders, rich vinegar-soy marinated pork topped with garlicky lechon sauce on a pillowy pan de sal bun. From there, the savory, moist chicken adobo awaits, atop garlic rice with tiny dried shrimp. (Ask for a side of hot sauce and banana ketchup for even more flavor.) Deep-fried banana spring rolls with calamansi coconut cream are a sweet finish.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94103-Pampalasa-477465-41102
20,Kiss,Cuisine Japanese,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Simple standard.,"In a sea of trendy and flashy Japanese restaurants, this mom-and-pop standby sometimes gets drowned out-but one taste of its top-quality fish will have you hooked for life. Traditional nigiri, ranging from giant clam and halibut to bluefin tuna, arrives minimally dressed and served atop excellent rice. Appealing non-sushi options include a delicate chawan mushi filled with flaky white fish and buttery ginkgo berries, with an umami-rich dashi. Adjacent to Japantown's Peace Plaza, tiny Kiss is easy to miss (look for the sign on the door), and reservations are recommended. Expect a quiet, sparse, and decorous atmosphere, with polite service from the husband-and-wife owners. The contemplative vibe encourages savoring each delicious morsel.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94115-Kiss-253808-41102
21,Liholiho Yacht Club,Cuisine Hawaiian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard. Our best addresses.,"This charming, highly personal newcomer delightfully reflects Chef/owner Ravi Kapur's patchwork upbringing-blending Hawaiian, Indian, Asian, and Californian influences into its own unique cuisine. Blue entryway tiles spelling ""ALOHA"" lead to a bustling bar, a sunny-yellow exhibition kitchen, as well as a sleek dining room, all attended to by exceptionally hospitable servers. A refreshing Clifton special cocktail (with genever and coconut water) is the perfect counterpart to intriguing snacks like silky tuna poke atop crunchy nori crackers, smoky beef tongue wrapped in fluffy clamshell buns, and Flintstone-sized beef ribs in a sweet-spicy red chili sauce. Be sure to save room for the tangy, dense cardamom cheesecake with pistachio and Cara Cara oranges.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94109-Liholiho_Yacht_Club-471911-41102
22,Octavia,Cuisine Californian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Good standard.","Chef/owner Melissa Perello, already a local culinary personality with Frances, shines even brighter at this new sequel in the tony Lower Pacific Heights neighborhood. Packed with a dynamic and diverse group of diners, the airy and open space is designed with a minimalist-chic eye, from the white-tiled kitchen to those raw-wood benches lined with wool-encased pillows. Service is enthusiastic and genuinely hospitable. Chef Perello has a gift for elevating straightforward dishes through the use of pristine ingredients and technique, and her magic is in full force here with dishes like golden saffron fettuccine twirled with caramelized garlic, wilted fennel, and roasted tomatoes. Luscious roasted king salmon with fingerling potatoes in a dill-infused crème fraîche sauce may seem basic, but in her hands, it's anything but. Even a simple grilled toast, with warm, creamy house-made ricotta and charred spring onion, is revelatory. At Octavia, the golden touch extends to the exquisite desserts, which might include a nectarine ""float"" with nectarine ice cream and soda, mint, and lavender, and the thoughtful wine list brims with unusual options. With food and furnishings this captivating, tables fill early, so be sure to reserve well in advance.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94109-Octavia-471905-41102
23,Aveline,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Snap-happy Instagrammers will delight in this contemporary stunner in the Warwick Hotel, where the Hollywood Regency-style room and exquisitely arranged plates are picture-perfect. Located steps from the busy shopping corridor of Union Square, it's a great spot to unwind with a refreshing, bubbly cocktail-either over a full meal or a snack at adjoining bar, The European. The kitchen's artful creations include a spiraling arrangement of house-smoked salmon with ribbons of lightly pickled vegetables and avocado purée, or a crispy duck leg resting atop charred Brussels sprouts, cherry, and parsnip. Don't miss the menu's chief attraction: delicate, buttery crab ""macarons"" or tiny sandwiches filled with an ample portion of creamy, herb-flecked crab salad.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94102-Aveline-445269-41102
24,Kin Khao,Cuisine Thai,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Simple standard.","Don't let its covert location fool you-Kin Khao is a flagrantly delicious and very distinctive dining room. The décor is unexceptional by no uncertain terms, but really nobody seems to care, as the cooking-punctuated by Californian elements and welcome seasonality-is the real deal. Northern Thai is what this kitchen is all about and pad Thai-loving palates should vacate these premises...pronto. Of course, the unique menu reads like a veritable thesis on Isaan food mingled with California love. Then there's the easygoing and chill staff who never miss a beat-as they bestow tables with vibrant, product-driven plates. These have included crispy lima beans tossed in nam tok followed by crunchy albeit not as ""hot"" chicken wings massaged with tamarind and chili. Pork meatballs seasoned with garlic and lemongrass (laab tod) are enriched by a phenomenal chili (jaew) sauce; while a gorgeous platter of crunchy vegetables is accompanied by a jar of the incredible nam prik (potent with shrimp paste) layered with caramelized pork jowl, fried catfish, and a salted duck egg. Panang curry with tender-braised duck is a champ among palates less valiant. Closing arguments may reveal that this is a truly Thai kitchen turning out insanely memorable food. All objections overruled.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94102-Kin_Khao-445271-41102
25,54 Mint,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"With its largely Italian waitstaff and clientele, a meal at 54 Mint is the next best thing to a plane ticket to Rome. A happy respite from the neighborhood's hustle and bustle, the space boasts a contemporary dining room stocked with shelves of Italian ingredients and a surprisingly tranquil front patio facing Mint Plaza. The food is an authentic culinary journey through the Eternal City, with favorites like perfectly al dente bucatini all'amatriciana, twirled with smoked pancetta, sweet onion, tomato, and chili. The must-order suppli, fried balls of tomato risotto stuffed with smoked mozzarella, are best described as arancini on steroids. For dessert? The buttery, dark chocolate-flecked ricotta tart will leave you feeling molto buono.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94103-54_Mint-259835-41102
26,Manora's Thai Cuisine,Cuisine Thai,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"A firmly rooted dining destination in this otherwise underdeveloped part of town, Manora's has been a source for authentic Thai dishes since the '80s.

The pace at dinner is more relaxed, with endearing service that makes customers truly feel at home amid the wood carvings of the dining room.

27,Bar Agricole,Cuisine Californian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Cocktails and conversation are always a pleasure at Bar Agricole, which is known for having one of the city's best drink programs. Its narrow, industrial-modern dining room boasts soaring ceilings from which huge acrylic sculptures hang, while mod concrete booths line the side wall. An outdoor patio, with plant beds and a trickling fountain, is particularly popular for brunch. The menu is thoroughly Californian and loaded with the season's best, showcased in dishes like a frisée, arugula, and radish salad with a citronette dressing; halibut brandade with asparagus; as well as roast pork leg and belly with Canario beans, greens, and horseradish. At brunch, opt for flavorful, tender, and homemade lamb sausage served over fried eggs and wilted kale.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94103-Bar_Agricole-325323-41102
28,The Progress,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"The sequel to mega-popular State Bird Provisions, located right next door, has retained all of its sibling's inventiveness while moving things forward (hence the name) in a more restrained, elegant way. Set in a 100-year-old former theater, the retro-industrial space is a real looker, with attentive, thoughtful service and exceptional wine and cocktails to boot. Diners are encouraged to team up to savor the ""choose-your-own-adventure"" feast, which allows a choice of six courses from a list of about 20.

Good standard.","The crowds start queuing up long before State Bird Provisions swings open its doors, with excited guests hoping to score one of their few dozen walk-in spots (you can also make reservations, but the process is still a coup). The buzzing and open kitchen located up front is the focal point of the space. The energy is palpable, and a night out at this popular spot can feel (in the best way possible) like you've scored a ticket to a very cool party. The bright, industrial-chic dining room features countrified yet sleek wooden tables; and playful pegboard walls showcasing intricate wire sculptures. The easygoing army of servers roll the kitchen's seasonal American small plates around dim sum-style on trolleys (or carry it by foot), showcasing each menu item with an accompanying price tag. It's hard not to want a taste of everything on offer, which is probably even more reason to come with as many friends as you can rally. A quenelle of rich squab liver pâté is spread on sweet almond cakes; while plump Guinea Hen dumplings are served in a fragrant hen broth. Then, a flaky, croissant-like wheat bread gets a creamy hit of burrata and thump of crushed black pepper; and ultra-fresh sweet peas are paired with spicy horseradish cream and fried parsnip chips.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94115-State_Bird_Provisions-365863-41102
30,398 Brasserie,Cuisine French,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Skip the Union Square tourist traps and head for this newcomer in the Hotel G, where the French-accented fare is a step up from the neighboring options. Distressed pillars and ceiling panels give the interior a demolition-chic vibe, but contemporary chandeliers, sleek furniture, and a gleaming exhibition kitchen make the chaos feel flashy, not funky. The cocktail crowd descends early here, and for good reason: the drinks are outstanding, and pair well with the kitchen's Euro-American cuisine. Try the classic Lyonnaise salad of frisée, poached egg, crisp bacon lardons, and duck prosciutto, or the tender duck confit with cremini mushroom fricassee. If it's available, the wood-roasted calamari with smoked peppers and chorizo is not to be missed.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94012-398_Brasserie-468657-41102
31,The Cavalier,Cuisine Gastropub,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard. Our best addresses.,"One of the city's high-profile openings, this is the third effort from the team behind Marlowe and Park Tavern. Everything here has a British bent, echoed in the hunting-lodge-gone-sophisticated décor with red-and-blue walls accented by taxidermied trophies and tufted banquettes. Across-the-pond classics have Californian twists like a deep-fried Scotch duck egg wrapped in truffled duck rillettes. The restaurant has quickly become a see-and-be-seen haunt of the tech oligarchy (complete with a private club). However, the food is comforting and homey as seen in a caramelized roast chicken set atop horseradish mash. Though reservations are a must, its location in Hotel Zetta means service runs from morning to night, giving diners plenty of options.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94103-The_Cavalier-437012-41102

Pastas must not be missed, such as the lobster-filled raviolo in smoked butter-lobster jus. Decadent risotti may arrive topped with Taleggio, velvety egg yolk, compressed radicchio and herbaceous nasturtium leaves to cut the richness. A perfectly pink duck breast with sunflower seed-huckleberry relish, Nantes carrots, and pink peppercorn-duck jus adds just the right note of rusticity.

Spicy tuna gets a run for its money from the impressive spicy tofuna rolls, with chili-inflected minced tofu and cucumber crowned with creamy avocado and dusted in chili ""tobiko."" A yuba salad with miso dressing and tempura-battered shiitake mushrooms stuffed with faux-crab are equally compelling.

Simple standard.","Formerly an izakaya, this elegant Japanese restaurant has changed chefs and focus, offering delicate Washoku-style fare (read: no sushi). A meal might begin with thin slices of lightly torched mackerel, artfully arranged on shiso leaves; then transition to tender Wagyu beef tataki, airy shredded vegetable and shrimp tempura, and a delicate sundae of azuki beans, mocha, and kelp gelée over vanilla ice cream. With Tartine Bakery and other great gourmet spots sharing its block, there's no denying the fact that Yuzuki has a lot of competition. But with such an exquisite array of plates, not to mention outstanding organic sake and nutty buckwheat tea for sipping, it will transport you to Japan-provided you can snag a tough-to-get reservation.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94110-Yuzuki-372862-41102
63,Aatxe,Cuisine Spanish,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"The name is pronounced ""ahh-chay"" and the food is pronounced ""delicious"" at this Spanish charmer, where pintxos like boquerones with green olive, smoked salmon deviled eggs, and chanterelle croquetas taste straight out of San Sebastián. Keep it classic with shrimp al ajillo, bathed in sizzling garlic-chili oil, or try the adventurous ""Spanish fried rice,"" a take on paella packed with smoky chorizo, tender cuttlefish, and nuggets of tortilla Española. Set in the historic Swedish-American Hall, the small, modern art-packed space has an open kitchen and a thumping, clubby vibe-it's not the place for quiet conversation. But thanks to the well-curated menu of gin and tonics (a Spanish favorite), it's ideal for letting loose and having fun.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94114-Aatxe-477455-41102
64,Lord Stanley,Cuisine Californian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Good standard.","You'll feast like a very refined lord at this outstanding newcomer, which, like its husband-and-wife chef/owners, is half Californian, half European. The West Coast vibe comes from the outstanding local ingredients and airy, light-flooded contemporary space, while across-the-pond touches (both chefs trained in the UK) include tip-free dining with all-inclusive dish prices and an intriguing wine list offering unusual Eastern European vintages. Like its space, Lord Stanley's food is approachably refined, with stunning creations like a summer squash tart with almonds, summer squash, and herb aïoli. Silky black cod, pan-seared in butter and served in a spicy fava bean- and avocado-studded broth, is a showstopper. Even a seemingly simple dessert of grilled peaches with white Lillet sorbet and fruity olive oil gets an intriguing touch from slivers of Castelvetrano olives that add just the right amount of vibrancy. In keeping with its San Franciscan ethos, Lord Stanley is a laid-back spot: the crowd of yupster couples often arrives on foot to the central Polk Street location, attired in casualwear. Be sure to quiz the attentive staff on the dishes-they'll happily explain each intricate layer.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94109-Lord_Stanley-477461-41102

Good standard.","A little bit Eastern European, a little bit Californian, and a whole lot of delicious, this is a favorite among local gourmets. Now chef-owned and with an impending name change, the intensely satisfying menu continues to sate with everything from falafel-like sprouted lentil fritters with kefir and beet sauce, to roasted carrots with sumac yogurt and sunflower tahini. Wood-smoked, flash-fried potatoes, served with earthy black garlic aïoli and an herb salad, are unmissable. The hearty, homey vibe extends to the rustic dining room, with well-worn floors and simple wood furnishings, as well as the gracious staff, who makes diners feel right at home. Be sure to sample the tasting menu, which shows promise of great things to come, along with a house-made soda, tea, or creative cocktail.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94110-Bar_Tartine-122614-41102
66,Locanda,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This chic Roman-style osteria packs in the hipsters with a lively scene, killer cocktails, and inspired pastas, like radiatore tossed in tomato-lamb ragù with pecorino and hints of fresh mint. None of this is surprising, considering Locanda is from the team behind Mission favorite, Delfina. Classic chicken under a brick is characteristically on-point: smoky, tender, and served with a squeeze of lemon over nutty farro, Umbrian lentils, and red quinoa salad. Reservations here are a tough ticket, but the attire and vibe are casual and welcoming (if noisy). Can't get a table? Seats at the bar, where the full menu is served, are a solid backup. Locanda's ultra-central address makes parking a challenge, so plan on using the valet or allotting extra time.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94110-Locanda-338321-41102
67,Akiko's,Cuisine Japanese,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Simple standard.,"Akiko's is hard to find. In addition to sharing a name with a lesser nearby sushi bar, it's hidden just off an alleyway and has no sign. The cool clientele is probably happy to avoid any more competition for the mere handful of tables and seats at the small sushi bar. Arrive at dinner, sit at the counter, toss aside that à la carte menu, and opt for an omakase feast created by the very talented chefs. Expect them to take liberties and leave tradition behind; yet the quality remains high with pristine nigiri featuring fluke, scallop, or geoduck clam minimally garnished and perched atop rice with a touch of nutty red rice vinegar. Bookend the meal with rich tuna poke with sesame, or a lightly torched slice of A5 Wagyu beef with black truffle shavings.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94108-Akiko_s-439932-41102

Sister to Cal-cuisine icon Nopa, Nopalito is so beloved that an equally good and popular Inner Sunset location is thriving. The small, cheerful space with reclaimed wood and bright green accents doesn't take reservations; call ahead to get on the list, or try takeout. Once seated, friendly servers will guide the way with house-made horchata for the kids and an extensive tequila selection for grown-ups. Both groups will certainly agree on a sweet finish: Mexican chocolate and seasonal fruit paletas are a favorite.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94117-Nopalito-257769-41102

It's the kind of place where you'll see FiDi brokers rehash deals over pre-dinner cocktails, before being joined by their well-dressed dates for a swanky dinner party upstairs. The menu of French brasserie favorites is prepared with skill, from grand plateaux of fruits de mer to a perfectly cooked flatiron steak with well-seasoned pommes frites and red wine bordelaise. Don't miss the outstanding Paris-Brest, golden-hued pastry filled with creamy rose-mascarpone and juicy raspberries.

70,Omakase,Cuisine Japanese,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Good standard.","An ""omakase"" places the guests in the hands of the chef-and indeed the only dining option at this tiny new Edomae-style restaurant are three chef-designed tasting menus, clocking in at $100, $150, or $200. Sound risky? It isn't: trust us, this is an experience worth relinquishing all control for. Housed in an area of SoMa popping with big tech companies and modern lofts, Omakase is a quiet little oasis of elegant minimalism. The tiny dining room consists of an L-shaped counter offering 14 seats (so yes, you'll definitely want to make reservations) facing the chefs. But, while all eyes are focused on the food, you won't get the impression these chefs think they're rock stars. On the contrary, it's not uncommon for them to inquire if the size of the sushi rice is appropriate for each guest's mouth; and the chefs and servers both bow profusely and offer their gratitude upon exit. A night in their capable hands will reveal plate after plate of fresh sushi and sashimi (flown in three times a week from the Tsukiji fish market) and unique little dishes like a seaweed and fresh herb salad, laced with lovely strands of Okinawan sea grapes, served over cured whitefish and accompanied by white tuna temarizushi.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94103-Omakase-477464-41102
71,L'Ardoise,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Local couples do date night in high Parisian style at this long-running Duboce Triangle bistro, where a largely French staff serves up classics like coq au vin and steak frites. The seafood cassolette brings together plump prawns, huge mussels, and flaky fish over a bed of mashed potatoes, then swaths them in a velvety lobster bisque reduction. A floating island of caramelized meringue is especially indulgent, when served in a pool of crème anglaise with strawberries and caramel sauce. Set on a charming, tree-lined block, L'Ardoise's secret weapon is its softly lit back area, whose rich burgundy walls draw in diners. Given their compact space and subdued ambience, save this one for a tête-à-tête, not a big group.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94114-L_Ardoise-257768-41102
72,Saison,Cuisine Californian,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"Three MICHELIN stars: unique cuisine. Worth a special trip! 





Very good standard. Our best addresses.","No expense has ever been spared in this massive wow-inducing space. There are enough shining copper pots to supply a village of restaurants in France; wood tables, smart chairs, and faux-fur rugs mean that someone has recently been to Scandinavia. There is also a refreshing breakdown of traditional barriers between the kitchen and dining areas-underscored by the chefs' visits to each table, personally presenting and describing dishes. Dining here is gorgeous; some find the service personalities to be pompous, while others regard them as warm and convivial. However, the blaring 80's soundtrack (if indeed that is your era) keeps the mood lively. One thing that is undeniable is the level of extraordinary skill and detail that Chef Joshua Skenes uses to craft each item on his spontaneous menu. Expect cultured butters and cream, light and infused broths, as well as the smoke of a wood-fired oven to feature prominently. Meals may highlight luscious white sturgeon caviar with crisp potatoes tourné and a dab of cultured cream. Then, sample sweet, tender lobster barely warmed over coals with a savory seaweed dressing and rich lobster-brain sauce. Dry-aged duck is grilled ""near the fire,"" served with giblet-confit ragù, wood-roasted date, a dark jus, and is absolutely delicious.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94107-Saison-293069-41102
73,Pesce,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Like any good SF renter, when Pesce saw an opportunity for more space, it made the move and uprooted from Polk Street to the Castro. Its commodious new home is minimalist yet warm, with wood tables, bistro chairs, and a pressed-tin ceiling. But some things stay the same, namely, the Venetian-inspired, seafood-heavy cuisine and wonderfully warm service for which it's known. As the Market Street crowds pass by, groups of friends sip wine and share small plates like fritto misto; or caramelized potato gnocchi with shreds of milk-braised pork, sage, and crispy pancetta. The silky hamachi crudo is a must-order, accented with citrus-infused olive oil and a tangle of micro greens. Creamy, none-too-sweet panna cotta is a comforting conclusion.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94109-Pesce-436459-41102

Very good standard.","With the debut of this glamorous outpost at the base of the PacBell building, Aziza Chef/owner Mourad Lahlou has become a big-city slicker. The area's young, food-obsessed techies practically flock to this grand space, replete with soaring ceilings, glowing central columns, and a glass-enclosed wine cellar catwalk. Chef Lahlou's food retains the influence of his Moroccan upbringing, with dishes like duck confit basteeya rolled in thin sheets of flaky pastry. However, diners can also look forward to new levels of creativity using ingredients from around the globe. Even a simple dish of carrots gets unexpected heft from meaty dates and crunchy pecans, not to mention a hit of spice from urfa pepper. Then a wreath of eggplant packs a punch of texture and flavor into one beautiful dish; while tender, smoky octopus, served in a spicy lamb merguez broth with chickpea purée, is Californian and Moroccan all at once. The visionary chef's attention to detail extends to the exceptional drinks. But, those travelling in groups may also want to consider the larger La'Acha menu, which offers family-style Moroccan dishes. Imagine roast chicken or lamb shoulder, rife with sides and sauces, and you'll get the picture.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94105-Mourad-468674-41102

They're perfect palate-cleansers for the expansive and delightful house charcuterie like rich duck pâté with plum and Armagnac or garlicky finocchiona kissed with fennel seeds. While their salumi and selection of spirits are huge draws, Trou Normand is an all-day menu of shareable French- and Italian-leaning plates. Come for a croque madame with ramps and locally roasted coffee at brunch, sausage sandwiches with homemade sauerkraut at lunch, and pastas or roasted meats at dinner.

The rustic décor features white subway-tile walls, an open kitchen, and wood and metal furniture. Be warned: the noise level can be a bit high for any intimate conversation. The highlight here is pizza, with creatively topped pies like summer squash with pesto, burrata, and Calabrian chili, or sausage, broccoli, leeks, pecorino, and olives. They're pricey, but worth it. A selection of salads and antipasti make for great starters. Otherwise, opt for rigatoncini in a meaty pork ragù with fresh, creamy ricotta and more Calabrian chili.

The stylish occupants, from tech millionaires to white-haired society matrons, stream into the light-filled dining room where they angle for a seat at the semi-private banquette facing the street or in the front room at the marble bar. The menu is prepared with skill and top-notch ingredients, and includes a note-perfect fried chicken and caramelized Alaskan halibut with grated cauliflower and peperoncini. The burger, served on a pretzel bun with smoked tomato, is also a terrific choice.

The slate-gray dining room is serene with clean lines drawing the eye across the meticulous design, while the staff is impressively warm and relaxed for a restaurant of this caliber. Chef Corey Lee's nightly tasting menu is a unique marriage of contemporary American and Korean influences and Master Sommelier Yoon Ha oversees an exceptional beverage program. Dishes promise a fascinating interplay of ingredients, as seen in the potato salad crowned with mirin-glazed anchovies and spirals of mild red chili. Find subtlety and elegance in raw fluke seasoned with sesame oil and sandwiched between crisp sesame leaves; while sea bream served in an aged tangerine jus with black trumpet mushrooms is royally decadent. Rich, marbled beef reaches a new height of excellence when prepared with charred scallion sauce, ramps, and meaty morels.

Or try the fried pancakes, loaded with kimchi and onion. On the lighter side, there's a great salad with large cubes of tofu and crisp greens topped with tangy vinaigrette and dollops of chili sauce. With this booze-friendly menu, great drinks are paramount, and Janchi's list brims with Korean beers, soju, sake, and cocktails to prime your palate for the next bite.

Equal parts industrial loft and swanky Prohibition-era club, Per Diem is a vision of rich wood surfaces, dramatic pillars, exposed brick, and concrete. It's a sleek atmosphere for a sleek crowd-but the real draw here is the food. A new chef has taken the menu in a seasonally inspired direction that's at once refined and approachable. Of-the-moment delights include a salty, smoky flatbread topped with slices of roasted porcini and hon shimeji mushrooms, shaved prosciutto, and crescenza cheese. This may be tailed by an equally impressive spinach-ricotta ravioli with roasted squash, a soft-poached egg, and sprinkle of lemon gremolata.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94101-Per_Diem-468656-41102

Its terra-cotta floors, yellow walls, and chunky wood tables have a Mediterranean air, but the menu is more eclectically American, with a sizable beer and wine selection that makes the front bar great for a spur-of-the-moment drink and bite. Clever takes on approachable dishes abound on the menu, from ""toad in the hole"" lasagna with a poached egg at dinner, to asparagus and duck confit hash at brunch. The creamy smoked salmon mousse, with bagel chips and crème fraîche, is rich and delicious. And pillowy doughnuts, topped with PB&J at dinner or pumpkin spice and pumpkin butter at brunch, are a delightful surprise.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94109-Stones_Throw-437008-41102

Highlights include tender, smoky grilled octopus with spicy romesco and salsa verde; a delectable trio of heirloom carrots (caramelized, shaved, and pickled); and moist, flaky white bass with roasted artichoke purée, artichoke chips, and briny olive tapenade. While Reverb's menu has shifted, its hip space was left mostly untouched, with dramatic antique wood doors, soaring ceilings, and a glowing tower of back-lit jars of homemade pickles.

The well-appointed interior is worlds away from the busy thoroughfare's steady stream of traffic, with linen-draped tables, big blue-cushioned armchairs, and warm, inviting service. Every meal here kicks off with a basket of fluffy flatbread, served with three irresistible dipping sauces. The kaddo, caramelized baby pumpkin and ground beef in a garlic-yogurt sauce, is a perennial favorite, as is the chapendaz, marinated beef tenderloin over a tomato-pepper purée, rice, and lentils.

Even veggie-centric celery Victor gets a meaty spin, its tangy vinaigrette accented by crisp chicken-skin chicharrónes. Thanks to the hearty menu and location in a tech-centric corridor, Cockscomb draws a mostly male crowd that packs in for shellfish platters and intense, boozy cocktails named for SF landmarks.

Though the crowd is decidedly non-Chinese with more than a few tourists mixed in, the food isn't overly Americanized and covers a range of regional specialties. Commence your culinary tour of China with an order of barbecue spareribs, lacquered on the outside and exceptionally tender on the inside, or a piece or two of dim sum. Then dive into the Chiuchow-style marinated duck, a plateful of sweet-and-salty meat beneath crisp, golden-brown skin.

Start with the tasty calamari à la plancha-its topping of briny black olives and sliced jalapeños clearly differentiates Fringale from its tired bistro competition.

Frascati's fare may not be the city's most innovative, but it is very satisfying, thanks to well-made classics like tender potato gnocchi with asparagus and peas in thyme-white truffle butter, or grilled duck breast in pomegranate sauce over hearts of palm and herb spaetzle.

Instead of relying on the bold, spicy approach of local taquerias, Regalito takes a milder, ingredient-focused path, infusing dishes like chicken enchiladas with new life via handmade corn tortillas, fresh roast chicken, and a delicate green chili sauce. Familiar Mexican favorites get an upgrade here, from the super-sweet, fresh corn on the cob elote with tangy chili-lime mayo and cotija, to that silky vanilla flan bobbing in a pool of caramel sauce.

Inside, the dining room nails that Nordic-Cali sensibility with sleek filament light bulbs, bare wood, and frosted glass that allows sun but shields guests from the bustling (read gritty) surrounds. The hospitable team of servers shares that same informal style. And their long counter is the absolute best place to drink, dine, and chill with a few friends. À la carte offerings are a welcome alternative to the fixed menu, and light portions encourage ordering four or more courses. The full tasting though lets guests thoroughly explore the kitchen's adept contemporary cooking. However, this meal may not be for everyone as the chefs' creativity can be more eclectic than crowd-pleasing. Begin with a lush, layered presentation of decadent sea urchin with creamy cauliflower pudding, fennel, and trace of popcorn powder and kale juice. Then remarkably tender pork cheeks are infused with wood smoke and served with Brussels sprout leaves, shaved apple, and crisp daikon in a fermented chili-miso broth.

Even an old-school sticky toffee cake is elevated with fresh Medjool dates and tangy mascarpone. A nexus of the Castro social scene, the cheerful, wood-paneled space is always full of locals hopping from table to table to greet their friends, and the back patio (heated and sheltered when it's foggy) is an appealing refuge.

Here, old architectural and botanical sketches as well as vintage maps abound; and the staff is attentive, efficient and kind, never fussy or intrusive. The unique food has a strong Persian influence that is showcased in tender meatballs with harissa, pomegranate, and pistachios. But even the more contemporary fare boasts a nuanced blend of spices, like the black cardamom in a braised short rib with quinoa, cranberry beans, and salsa verde. A tangy goat cheesecake with eggplant jam may sound strange, but is utterly satisfying.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94107-Fly_Trap-257779-41102

But even with this rarefied competition, Delfina books up well in advance and draws lines for its few walk-in seats. The simple, yet lively dining room is attended to by a warm staff, and the bill of fare shifts with the seasons. Soul-satisfying dishes include house-made fazzoletti with garlicky basil pesto, tender potatoes, and crisp green beans, as well as a perfectly roasted half-chicken in a richly caramelized jus. For dessert, one spoonful of the creamy, delicate fig-leaf panna cotta, accented by macerated pluots, will have you floating home on a cloud.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94110-Delfina-122601-41102
94,Leopold's,Cuisine Austrian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"The boisterous spirit of an Austrian gasthaus is alive and well in Russian Hill. All thanks are due to Leopold's, which draws a young crowd to its slice-of-Vienna dining room, adorned with wood booths, deer antlers, and attended to by cheerful female servers in dirndls. If dinner alone is your goal, go early; convivial groups lend the space a communal mien, but also get larger and louder as the night wears on and the boots of beer are drained. The carte du jour is rife with well-executed classics like golden-brown pork wiener schnitzel with a cucumber salad, vegetable strudel, and delectable raspberry Linzer torte. If you've got a group in tow, the choucroute garni platter, laden with pork ribs, sausage, potatoes, and sauerkraut, is a crowd-pleaser.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94109-Leopold_s-338326-41102

Nearly every dish is crowned with chilies, from the huge mound of dried peppers that rest atop tender, garlicky bites of fried chicken to the flaming chili oil anointing tender, flaky fish fillets in a star anise-tinged broth with Sichuan peppercorns aplenty. The well-worn dining room may seem unremarkable and the service perfunctory, but the crowds are undeterred. Plan to wait among eager fans for a seat, but then settle in for delicate pork-and-ginger wontons swimming in spicy peanut sauce and more chili oil.

Chic, cozy, and perpetually packed, it's as perfect for a low-key date night as it is for dinner with the kids. And while reservations are a nigh-impossible score, the gracious staff saves ten counter seats for walk-ins-and serves every diner with equal aplomb. Perello eschews trendy powders and foams for hearty, seasonal fare, like bacon beignets with maple-chive crème fraîche, vibrant spinach and green garlic soup with black pepper cookies, and pan-seared wild trout with sunchokes and spiced yogurt. An array of exquisite desserts, like buttermilk panna cotta with strawberries, offers a fresh, light conclusion.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94114-Frances-271318-41102

Good standard. Our best addresses.","Communal dining is the name of the game at this white-hot restaurant. Billed as a fine dining dinner party, Lazy Bear is an underground phenom ""gone legit,"" meaning your average Joe can now score a seat. That is, if they can jump through a few hoops: you'll need to buy a ticket in advance, and once you do, you'll be e-mailed a list of house rules you should read in earnest. Fortunately, this hip hottie delivers. The nightly tasting menu is dished out in a cool, bi-level warehouse and starts with aperitifs served alongside small bites upstairs in the loft, before moving downstairs to a dining room that boasts two giant tree slabs as communal tables, each lined with 20 chairs. Diners are given a pamphlet with the menu (there's space for note-taking underneath) and are invited to walk into the kitchen to chat with the cooks themselves. The young crowd loves this kind of chef worship, and digging into David Barzelay's luscious fare, we're inclined to agree. A saffron dish of creamy Anson Mills grits arrives with fresh lobster, pickled chard, Tokyo turnips, and prawn roe crisps; while tender caramelized squab is paired with lightly roasted sweet pear, a reduced jus, and crushed spices for dipping.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94110-Lazy_Bear-468662-41102

Nonetheless, it's become a standby for business types doing deals or enjoying post-work cocktails. Complete with dark wood and leather furnishings, a private billiards room, and bustling bar, Wayfare Tavern has the air of a gastropub-turned-private club. Hearty Americana with seasonal accents defines the menu, like a take on biscuits and gravy that integrates plump dayboat scallops and spicy chili oil. Buttermilk-brined fried chicken, grilled hanger steak, and baked macaroni and cheese are pure comfort, as is a decadent TCHO chocolate cream pie with salty caramel ganache and devil's food cake crumble.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94111-Wayfare_Tavern-293063-41102

Flatbreads and salads round things out. The Euro-café vibe is fun with red banquettes, classic bistro chairs, and marble floors to complement the big beer selection (both European and domestic) and cocktails.

As with any killer deal, there are caveats: reservations are necessary and they are hard to score, and the noise level is through the roof. But, the historic brick space is lots of fun with cool, contemporary art and a namesake central trestle table. The fact that the price is right only adds to the lure.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94133-Trestle-477457-41102

Lusk's food is American with contemporary touches, from the togarashi and carrot coulis that spikes a highbrow take on shrimp and grits, to the ginger vinaigrette that accents a summery salad of little gem lettuce and heirloom cucumbers.

The drinks at Range continue to be as notable as the eats, and diners who skip cocktail hour are missing out on smart concoctions like the rum-based Wolf Moon, which boasts spicy, nutty notes from chili liqueur and sherry.

The upstairs restaurant is simple and airy, with wood furnishings, wide windows, and engaging servers at the ready. The American fare on the menu is unfussy and skillfully prepared, from butter-sautéed wild mushroom panzanella with chunks of torn sourdough and bacon-shallot vinaigrette, to a juicy, generously portioned half roast chicken, accompanied by toast slathered in chicken-liver mousse.

Good standard.","This is a place for dedicated sushi lovers. Serene with warm wood, clean lines, and a strong sense of minimalism, Kusakabe brings distinctive creativity to this sushi-focused operation. The stunning counter is crafted from a single piece of live-edge elm. Oyster-hued leather chairs and a ceiling of wood slats complete the Japan-chic look. Of late, due to increased popularity (and ergo, demand), the nightly omakase tasting has felt more like a conveyor belt-style dining experience. However, by employing myriad cooking techniques, Chef Mitsunori Kusakabe ensures that every bite is deliciously balanced and memorable. After awakening the palate with a cup of warm kelp tea, embark on a sashimi parade starring thick slices of bluefin served over crushed ice and with a tangy yuzu- onion- and sesame oil-sauce. A soup course may feature fresh crabmeat in a delicate tai broth bobbing with mitsuba, tofu, and sweet corn-speckled fish cake. And finally, a top rendition of sushi yields shima aji with daikon as well as ayu that is torched just enough to blister the skin and impeccably contrasted with grated cucumber. A single Shigoku oyster on the half shell served with a simple brushing of yuzu juice makes for a nice opening bite.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94111-Kusakabe-439933-41102

The food is Italian-American with Bloomfield's signature meaty influences, like flavorful, gamey grilled lamb ribs that nearly fall off the bone. Pastas are strong, from creamy gemelli cacio e pepe to rich, spicy bucatini all'Amatriciana, but don't neglect their vegetables: a dish of tender cauliflower and potatoes in a rich taleggio sauce with crunchy breadcrumbs is a showstopper.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94133-Tosca_Cafe-437010-41102

If you can't choose a single dish, opt for the popular ""trilogia"" of three daily delights, then follow it with pollo ai peperoni, a delicious chicken roulade stuffed with roasted bell pepper and served over crisp vegetables.

The décor is minimal with blonde wood tables and there are always specials so listen closely to the efficient staff as they recite the bounties of the day. A versatile drinks list completes the enticing spread in addition to offering a happy reprieve to those who've endured a long wait for limited tables. Dishes like delicately prepped scallops in saffron sauce, and crispy halibut tempura propped atop roasted cauliflower may vary by the day.

While the idea of ""poetic culinaria"" may seem self-indulgent to some, this cuisine is undeniably authentic, deeply personal, and filled with brilliant grace notes of flavor and creativity. Expect dishes that are light yet complex, such as fluke that seems ready to melt over tarragon ice, amid droplets of creamy smoked sturgeon, sea-cucumber dashi, and pickled Asian pears.

Throw in a glass of their refined Italian wine along with an alluring dessert like the salted caramel apple tart, and you can see why getting a table here is well worth the challenge.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94110-flour_water-260465-41102

It's one of those magical places that linger in the memory, and now the area has yet another reason to remember it by: the lovely, urbane Nico-a relaxed and sophisticated French bistro with a distinctly Californian vibe. The space houses only a 40-seat restaurant and a small bar area, but feels wonderfully expansive with its high ceilings, gleaming glass windows, seats overlooking Sacramento Street, and intimate tables with a view of the glass-enclosed kitchen in the back. Diners at Nico can choose between a three- or five-course dinner, listed off a menu that notes only the main ingredients. Co-owners Nicolas and Andrea Delaroque are essentially asking you to play a trust game-and you should not hesitate to jump. Razor-thin slices of crispy artichoke arrive fanned over cool green herb jus and topped with delicious minced escargot; while a dish of wildly fresh peas finds perfect pairing in basil, peaches and sweet ricotta. Tender seared duck breast, duck confit roulade, and duck liver mousse are plated with lentilles du Puy, fresh cabbage, and roasted hedgehog mushrooms for an earthy finish.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94115-Nico-436462-41102

Very good standard.","Even on the eve of its tenth anniversary, Coi manages to stay as fresh as the days when it first opened its doors. Its second decade is sure to be exciting as Daniel Patterson hands off his kitchen to a new and very talented brigade. The moniker translates to ""silent"" or ""quiet""-and indeed the restaurant owns a serene, Zen-like atmosphere with branches arching across the foyer; soft grey upholstered banquettes; bare wooden tables; supple brown leather chairs; and beautiful, conversation-worthy earthenware dishes. Service here is warm, refined and extraordinarily well trained-with a nearby sommelier at the ready with an impeccable wine list and a smile. Waiters quietly attend to every need of the stylish crowd. The kitchen's contemporary cooking is a joy to experience and the multi-course tasting menu showcases both incredible technique and pristine seasonal ingredients. Picture thinly sliced geoduck sashimi paired with crunchy, seasoned cucumber, shavings of radish, and violet-hued edible flowers. Then a bright, chilled English pea soup is poured over creamy buttermilk, soft yellow nasturtium and whole spring peas picked at their peak. Tender, bite-sized slices of aged duck find perfect company in vibrant spring greens, sprouted wheat berry, and a rich duck broth.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94133-Coi-165528-41102

Go another round with the time-honored Brussels sprout chips, or sample the newer lemon chips with burrata? Whatever you decide, you're unlikely to be disappointed. Options also abound in terms of seating-the sidewalk tables, window seats, and marble-topped bar counter are equally appealing. In terms of drinking: the house-concocted cocktails, local beers, and varied global wines will each call your name.

Since the chef makes each of her creations by hand, expect to spend three or so hours at the table-it's the perfect romantic escape for couples lingering over a bottle of wine. To sate your appetite while you wait, a bowl of light carrot soup or a delicate cucumber salad in a champagne vinaigrette will do the trick. But the soufflés are the real draw, and keen diners plan on both a savory and a sweet course. For the former, a combination of flaky salmon, tender asparagus, and caramelized Gruyère is a delight.

Depending on how you order from the Mediterranean-inspired menu, your palate could land in North Africa (piquant Tunisian lamb couscous), Burgundy (rich boeuf bourguignon), or Basque country (garlicky, herbaceous ratatouille and tender stewed chicken and sausage over buttery rice).

Service is basic but very friendly, and the simple, mini space is full of natural light from the quiet tree-lined street outside.

The signature Peking duck with its lacquered skin and fluffy buns is a memorable treat, as are the equally sweet and salty char siu bao. Of course, dumplings here are the true highlight, from plump and fragrant pork xiao long bao, to paper-thin har gao concealing chunks of fresh, sweet shrimp. Don't see favorites like the flaky egg custard tarts? Just ask the cheerful staff, who'll radio the kitchen for help via headsets.

This is the kind of place where even the attentive, hospitable service manages to feel laid-back, but getting in will require some effort-If you can't score a reservation, line up early to snag a walk-in table. Start with an aperitif as you peruse Chef Brett Cooper's elegant menu, which deftly interplays sweet, tangy, earthy, and salty elements in dishes like blanched asparagus with egg yolk, grilled spring onions, and shreds of ham hock. Packets of black cod, wrapped in chard leaves and steamed until tender, arrive in a complex, smoky bone broth, while deliriously rich pork head croquettes are balanced by a zippy arugula salad with blood orange kosho.

It's an efficient, professional place, but with little warmth; the hospitality is hit-or-miss at best. Steer clear of the overpraised cellophane noodles with crab or overpriced shaking beef, and stick to more solid offerings like gau choy gow, pan-fried dumplings with Gulf shrimp and vibrant garlic chives accompanied by a zippy soy and fish-sauce dip. Half-orders are encouraged, so take advantage by sampling more than one of the delectable vegetable sides, like crisp, spicy broccoli with pressed tofu.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94111-The_Slanted_Door-122658-41102

It's so pretty that you might struggle to keep your eyes on the plate. This roast house's surroundings are no slouch either, with a clubby, leather-clad dining room leading to a terrace designed for sunny afternoons. As the name promises, meat is the big draw here, with juicy, tender cuts of everything from American prime beef to Japanese Wagyu.

A small front café serves coffee and pastries, while the marble bar lures happy-hour crowds for a lengthy choice of cocktails or glass of wine from their extensive global list. Micro-seasonal and delightfully Californian, Spruce's cuisine spotlights Mediterranean cooking that is at once simple and undeniably elegant. Rustic and homey starters may include a savory turkey soup stocked with thick, toothsome strands of tagliatelle, sliced carrots, and tender white meat. Pan-roasted black cod begins as a beautifully seared skin-on fillet, which is then topped with smoked cherry tomatoes and plump borlotti beans, further elevated with a quenelle of basil pesto and fresh herb leaves. For dessert, miniature vanilla bean-speckled panna cotta is artistically plated alongside a swipe of silky crémeux infused with Kaffir lime, a neat scoop of blood orange sorbet, granola, and pomegranate arils.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/San_Francisco-94118-Spruce-212059-41102

Seafood-centric entrées make global use of the local waters' bounty by way of tender squid almost bursting with chorizo alongside candy-like chickpeas.

Unlike the competition, Papalote doesn't have a salsa bar, but it doesn't need one: its defining feature is its gobsmackingly good, house-made roasted tomato salsa, which you'll want to slather on dishes like the pitch-perfect breakfast burrito, stuffed with scrambled eggs, chorizo, cheese, and guacamole.

The name may suggest dishes swimming in butter, but Sous Beurre's food is actually light and delicate. Silky house-smoked trout comes with a bright salad of arugula, golden beets, and shaved fennel; and spelt is dressed up with spring asparagus, creamy shallot soubise, and mint.

Simple standard.","Sushi-seekers should take a pass, but those yearning for elegant, traditional Japanese food will find kindred spirits at this precious gem. The serene, ultra-minimalist dining room isn't fancy, with only a few shelves of ceramics as décor. But, older Japanese women in traditional garb who run the show are endlessly polite and attentive so long as you're not raising a din-or requesting a spicy tuna roll. If you're able to go with the flow, you'll find much to adore on their menu, like umami-rich wilted mizuna salad with fresh fava beans and bonito sauce, or pale green edamame tofu with fresh cherries, cherry blossom noodles, and a sour-salty cherry paste.

Desco's simple offerings are full of flavor, from a house-made charcuterie board of smoked duck, roasted porchetta, and rabbit terrine to golden pappardelle bathed in a thick lamb, red onion, and tomato sugo.

218,Nido,Cuisine Mexican,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"The industrial area west of the I-880 freeway doesn't boast many good restaurants, but this hidden Mexican gem is an exception. Complete with hip reclaimed-wood décor and a local clientele of business people along with trendy foodies, it's definitely a cut above a taqueria in terms of quality and price, with fresher, lighter food in smaller-but by no means stingy-portions. At lunch, a trio of tacos includes moist pork adobado with a sweet-and-spicy pineapple salsa, grilled chicken with chamoy glaze, and smoky beef barbacoa with caramelized onions. Dinner brings pozole with chicken and chile negro, and a grilled pork chop with braised greens and almond mole.

Its environs remain a bit dicey, but once inside, the smiling servers, boisterous crowds of families and friends, and reggae beats will transport you to the Caribbean-with a dose of California-chic from the modern interior design. Boldly flavored fare includes tender, smoky jerk chicken with an intense and peppery spice rub, and a milder (but wildly delicious) curried goat stew with potato, carrots, and onion. Crisp and flaky salt-fish fritters are mouthwateringly delicious, and ideal for dunking in an herbaceous chimichurri. Skip the forgettable desserts and save your calories for a refreshing rum cocktail from the Fern Gully bar.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Oakland-94601-Kingston_11-445330-41102
222,Buckeye Roadhouse,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This Marin hideout has welcomed generations of locals through its doors since 1937, even as its location on Highway 1 gave way to the more bustling 101.

Groups of hard-drinking twenty- and thirty-something's are everywhere at Hawker Fare, sharing plates, perusing the faux-graffiti on the walls, and bobbing their heads to the beat of their own soundtrack. They come for well-made Thai like arugula salad with lotus root, jicama, and Chinese sausage; or spicy gang dang tofu curry with pumpkin over steamed rice. Indeed, rice is everywhere on the menu, from lunchtime bowl combos to a coconut pudding with banana jam and sesame-a treat that merits the long waits.A second location in the Mission is equally popular.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Oakland-94612-Hawker_Fare-338332-41102

The space, with aqua-painted walls and rope elements, is tastefully nautical and designed to cater to guests' comfort as they peel apart dinner-there are towels on the tables and a special hand-washing sink.

Bottled and sold on-site, this stellar product beams atop shavings of Prosciutto di Parma with arugula and mozzarella di Bufala. Baked sea bass fillets are spread with an herbaceous horseradish crust-big on flavor but gentle on garnishes like chive-infused olive oil. Though its proximity to Highway 101 and roadside hotels isn't pleasant, an orange-and-charcoal color scheme and lofty ceilings ensure that the surrounds become a quickly fading memory.

Bright, colorfully decorated, and flooded with natural light, it's a casual space where diners order and pay at the counter, then sip drinks from glass Mason jars under the potted palms. The outstanding Baja fish tacos are the source of Cholita Linda's reputation, but its dishes traverse Latin America, from a hearty Cubano to a plate of slow-braised, well-seasoned carnitas with black beans and fried plantains.

251,High Peaks Kitchen,Cuisine Indian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"The Himalayan-inspired name and Dalai Lama headshot might have you guessing correctly that this retreat is owned by Tibetans, but there's a twist: they were raised in India, and South Asian cooking is their specialty. The simple space, with its bright colors, small open kitchen, and inviting patio, is a cheerful setting for enjoying the delicious, affordable food. A range of well-spiced dishes boast layers of aroma and flavor, from the whole cardamom, shredded ginger, and star anise in a fiery potato vindaloo, to the potent yellow curry in a stewed chicken jalfrezi. The clientele is largely Indian, a testament to the kitchen's authenticity, and they can be found filling up on potato-stuffed naan with toasted coriander and cumin as well as smoky, moist ground lamb kebabs with mint chutney.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Oakland-94618-High_Peaks_Kitchen-468697-41102

Goat stew with tomato and an intensely-spiced gravy is another delicious option. Located on busy San Pablo Avenue, Hamro is low-key, with red, rose, and copper décor and a beautiful mural from a local Nepali artist on the wall. It attracts a steady stream of regulars, particularly families, making it an excellent choice for a casual meal with kids in tow.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Albany-94706-Hamro_Aangan-361085-41102

But, after settling into a cozy wood table or perhaps at the granite bar, a lively, very communal vibe will ease any irritation. Forty-plus wines offered by the glass augment the appeal. The seasonal menu has a French affect, discernable in plump fava bean falafel set atop tart tahini and pickled turnips; or green-garlic soup with a fromage blanc crouton. Entrées like seared yellowtail Jack brightened with asparagus, spring onion, and a Meyer lemon-blood orange relish perk up the palate; while a wood-fired oven and heated patio provide comforting warmth for indoor and outdoor meals.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Oakland-94618-A_Cote-122457-41102

Nothing about Oliveto screams ""Italian,"" from the décor to the all-American staff; yet its menu is completely authentic.

You'll want to dress up and bring a date to match its stylish décor, all hammered copper bar, oversized framed windows, and patterned banquettes. Most dishes come straight from the wood-fired oven, including a lighter take on moussaka, with nutmeg-infused Greek yogurt béchamel baked over ground beef and eggplant; or a roasted red bell pepper stuffed with ground beef and rice. The htapodi, tenderly grilled octopus over shaved red onion and fried capers, is another hit for its full, smoky flavor.

Chewy, springy noodles and fresh vegetables like maitake mushrooms and tomato confit fill each bowl, with a choice of rich, savory pork or veggie Meyer lemon broths. With only three rotating ramens on the menu, appetizers actually make up most of the offering, and boy, they're killer-a shaved summer squash salad with creamy avocado and fried squash blossoms is to die for.

While dedicated vegans are sure to swoon, even hardcore carnivores might reconsider the lifestyle after a dose of Chef/owner Eric Tucker's culinary creativity, showcased best on a five-course ""Taste of Millennium"" menu.

Sichuan influences abound, but chili-hounds beware: the cooking is more about flavor than fire.

Fresh and flavorful meat and produce set Great China's food apart. And while it's not super-spicy, it's also not reliant on chili oil and Sichuan peppercorns to mask low-quality ingredients.

Bring the gang for an insanely affordable spread: start with thin slices of kabocha squash, battered and deep-fried until tender and served with a sweet-sour dipping sauce, or a tangy green papaya salad with fresh shrimp and a spicy chili-lime vinaigrette.

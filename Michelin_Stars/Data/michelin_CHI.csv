861,Viceroy of India,Cuisine Indian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Good standard.,"The periwinkle and lavender walls, sky-blue ceiling painted with clouds, and steely booths lining the spacious dining room at Viceroy of India keep things cool, letting the spice-inflected cuisine churned out by the kitchen provide the heat. White linen-draped tables as well as a full bar and wine list make this West Rogers Park retreat a regal choice. Though an à la carte menu is available for those who've got to get their fill of tandoori chicken, longtime patrons and lunch regulars make a beeline for the popular lunch buffet, stocked with North Indian standards like pakoras, samosas, saag paneer, chicken makhani, and goat curry. Complimentary naan is available by the basketful. The grab-and-go café next door lets passersby get their sweet fix.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60659-Viceroy_of_India-281136-41102
1,Cochon Volant,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Though it's attached to the Hyatt, Cochon Volant is quickly entrenching itself as a favorite with Loop locals and sightseers alike for its timeless warmth. Round bistro tables and bentwood chairs are clustered across the mosaic-tiled floor, while a broad, marble-topped bar is bustling with patrons from lunch to happy hour. French brasserie favorites dominate the menu, ranging from rustic French onion soup to lavish raw seafood plateaus. Steak frites are juicy and flavorsome with a tender prime cut of bavette, offered with five sauce options like a classic béarnaise or rich Roquefort. Breakfast is delicious, but for those who don't have time to sit and stay a while, the café and takeaway bakery lets commuters snag a pastry and coffee to go.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60603-Cochon_Volant-471936-41102
2,Rosebud Prime,Cuisine Steakhouse,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"A member of Chicago's longstanding Rosebud Restaurants, this Loop darling plays the part of a throwback American steakhouse to the hilt. Crimson-hued, faux-alligator chairs and banquettes punctuate a sprawling wood-paneled dining room, where tuxedoed servers weave expertly among suited bankers. A winding staircase leads to a lofty mezzanine. Classic cuts and chops abound, but Rosebud Prime does all of its dishes with panache. Double-cut bone-in lamb chops sport a plump ribbon of fat encircling their delicate, rich centers. Two strips of grilled skirt steak remain juicy and tender, complemented by a pile of caramelized Bermuda onions; and rich beef and veal ragù makes penne Bolognese a lovely surprise, finished with a dollop of fresh ricotta.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60603-Rosebud_Prime-281103-41102
3,Atwood,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This corner restaurant's 19th century façade may be historic, but its soaring dining room is a strikingly modern vision of white marble-topped tables, glossy beveled subway tiles, and low-slung black leather chairs and banquettes. The crimson bar stools fill with patrons meeting for business and pleasure all week, while brunch gets the place buzzing on weekends. Atwood's brasserie menu isn't exactly full of surprises, but its familiar foods are given first-class upgrades-think pancetta-studded mac and cheese; lamb chops with basil and preserved lemon; and an omelet with crunchy bacon, creamy Brie, and verdant asparagus. For a real wake-up call, the Inferno Virgin Mary has more than enough of a kick (plus more of that bacon as a garnish).",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60602-Atwood-268972-41102
4,Prime & Provisions,Cuisine Steakhouse,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"Though it would also feel at home in Las Vegas, this glitzy oversized steakhouse fits right in with its swanky Chicago riverfront neighbors. The polished, masculine interior makes its priorities clear from the get-go, showcasing a two-story wine tower and a peek into the dry-aging room under bold barrel-vaulted ceilings and chandeliers. A starter of chewy rosemary-sea salt monkey bread whets the palate, while rosy pink slices of slow-roasted bone-in prime rib, rubbed with a crust of fragrant herbs, take a classic hoagie to new heights. When paired with house-cut fries and creamy horseradish dip, it's a meal to rival a Porterhouse, but save room for dessert: a single-serving banana cream pie with loads of whipped cream is a whimsical final bite.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60601-Prime_Provisions-478764-41102
5,The Kitchen,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard. Our best addresses.,"Panoramic views and eye-popping spaces are par for the course at most of the lofty spots abutting the Chicago River, but The Kitchen's farm-to-table food manages to steer the focus back to the plate. The restaurant's approachable, community-minded take on straightforward seasonal food-along with its impressive drinks program-makes it easy to please. Even if you're not attending a Monday ""Community Night"" dinner alongside many of the purveyors whose ingredients appear on the plate, you'll find a fresh, flavorful mix of dishes. Crushed white bean bruschetta is topped with a sprightly herb and frisée salad, which is in turn dressed with a blood orange vinaigrette. And wild Bristol Bay salmon is poached with care, its silkiness punctuated by garlic-chive aïoli.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-The_Kitchen-474206-41102
6,Chicago Cut,Cuisine Steakhouse,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"Chicago Cut is a steakhouse perfectly suited for the City of the Big Shoulders. The finely tailored locale bustles day and night, thanks to being wrapped in windows along the riverfront, sumptuous red leather furnishings, warm wood trim, and a crackerjack service team cementing its steakhouse vibe. Non-meat entrées include cedar-planked salmon with a sriracha-honey glaze, but make no mistake: beef is boss here. Prime steaks, butchered and dry-aged in-house for 35 days, get just the right amount of time under the flame, as is the case with the perfectly cooked-to-order Porterhouse-pre-sliced and plated for each guest. Sides are a must and should include the dome of hashbrowns, creamed spinach redolent of nutmeg, or tender stalks of grilled asparagus.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Chicago_Cut-333098-41102
7,Remington's,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This shiny gem arrives courtesy of the 4 Star Restaurant Group behind Crosby's Kitchen, Dunlay's, and Frasca. Guests can choose from a few great seating options in the enormous space: a table by the large windows up front, thrown open on temperate days for people-watching; the U-shaped bar, chockablock with televisions airing the latest games; or the intimate, glassed-in dining room lined with wine bottles at the back. The restaurant features an elevated roster of American classics including steaks, rotisserie chicken and seafood-not to mention a raw bar with Kansai-style box-pressed sushi. It's hard to go wrong here, but don't miss the No. 8 Tuna, which is a ruby-red slice of ahi wrapped in crispy nori and tempura, then paired with kimchi-studded rice.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60602-Remington_s-478765-41102
8,Untitled Supper Club,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","An unmarked entrance leads the way to this sultry subterranean lair, its various rooms pumping out music and serving up handcrafted cocktails to a young, sexy clientele lounging in tufted leather banquettes. Lights are nice and sultry; tables are low-slung and casual; and there are no less than 507 whiskeys to choose from. A charcuterie board may offer up silky duck rillettes, shot through with foie gras; textured and spreadable liverwurst; as well as thin slices of prosciutto and coppa accompanied by a house-made mostarda. Overstuffed squash blossom rellenos are filled with creamy ricotta and served over Agave-spiked corn relish and chili-lime crema. Don't miss the scrumptious meatloaf sandwich, slathered with Korean-style ketchup, and laced with rosemary-infused aïoli.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-_-Untitled_Supper_Club-373580-41102
9,The Gage,Cuisine Gastropub,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"For 10 years, this expansive, eclectic gastropub has catered to the Millennium Park crowds. Handsome banquettes and columns wrapped in celadon tiles lend a clubby allure, but the space's buzzy vibe never feels overwhelming. While a bar stretching half the length of the restaurant gets its fair share of happy-hour crowds, the rear dining rooms offer a more relaxed setting. Pub classics with flair define the menu, like malt-battered cod with creamy tartar sauce and parsley-dusted thick-cut fries-a solid rendition of fish and chips. Keep it light with crunchy watercress and sugar snap pea salad with house-made burrata, or go all out with a plate of chocolate-toffee cream puffs garnished with tender cocoa-dusted marshmallows.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60603-The_Gage-289587-41102
10,RPM Steak,Cuisine Steakhouse,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Very good standard.,"RPM Steak shares the same sleek, moneyed vibe as still-happening RPM Italian, its sister restaurant located just around the corner. Polished black, white, and wood décor speaks to the finer things in life, with a menu of succulent steaks, raw bar offerings, and sides to back it up. For the best people-watching, score one of the semicircular booths edging the room. A massive single tiger prawn, served simply on ice with lemon, is a tasty, visually stunning starter. Steaks range from petite filets to dry-aged 24-ounce cowboy cuts with a list of big reds to match. Highlights include the classic, deeply satisfying steak frites, tender and pink inside, charred outside, and complemented by truffle béarnaise for the meat and Caesar dip for the fries.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-RPM_Steak-471939-41102
11,Acanto,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard. Our best addresses.,"Overseen by Billy Lawless, this Italian reincarnation set in the former Henri space knows how to make an impression: its prime location across from Millennium Park would be a looker any day, but it goes the extra mile with style and sociability. The dining room is striking with angular light fixtures and orange banquettes; a luminous marble bar and matching tables lend a masculine, sophisticated vibe. The carte's Italian standards are amped up to luxurious levels, like the Treviso and white bean salad with fennel, golden raisins, and crispy pancetta; or house-made duck egg spaghetti drenched in cream sauce and twirled around rapini, spicy pork sausage, and caramelized onions. For dessert, a fresh ricotta tart is highlighted by bittersweet orange marmalade.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60602-Acanto-474202-41102
12,Siena Tavern,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Chef Fabio Viviani's TV-ready Italian charisma extends to every corner of this huge, lively restaurant. A mixture of funky décor elements-like cascading plants ""growing"" from filing cabinets on walls-somehow manage to work in incongruous harmony with sexy black marble and stainless steel throughout the multilevel space. Various bars offer pizza, crudo, fresh mozzarella, and house-made pasta, though even globally influenced dishes have a Mediterranean touch. The Tavern burger accompanied by parmesan-dusted fries is stacked with melted Taleggio, crispy speck, and garlic aïoli. Order the lush, creamy tiramisù for dessert, which gets a crunch from chopped nuts and crisp homemade meringues, and you'll be tempted to lick the bottom of the zinc tin.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Siena_Tavern-408501-41102
13,Bavette's Bar & Boeuf,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard. Our best addresses.,"Restaurateur Brendan Sokoloff (also of Maude's Liquor Bar and Au Cheval) breathes new life into the tried-and-true steakhouse concept with this swanky destination. The vibe inside may be dark and loud, but that only adds to the bonhomie of the chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures, and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas. Predictably, steakhouse and raw bar standards dominate the menu. Most steaks are wet-aged, and though some may prefer more funk, the cuts are expertly broiled. The kitchen deserves praise for unexpected options like creamy short rib stroganoff featuring hand-cut pasta; buttermilk fried chicken; and sides such as elote-style corn in a rich cheese sauce sparked with lime.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Bavette_s_Bar_Boeuf-399958-41102
14,Tortoise Club,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard. Our best addresses.,"Every city needs a restaurant with the word ""club"" in the title-somewhere reassuringly old-school where you'd take your future father-in-law if you want to marry his daughter. Tortoise Club fits the bill perfectly. If it was just a few years older, it would be called an institution because it also harks back to more dissolute times; order a Negroni at lunchtime here and no one will bat an eyelid. The place has an unapologetically masculine look thanks to the mahogany paneling and dark leather seating. It has a lounge bar with nightly live jazz and a familiar menu of American classics, from big plates of seafood to great steaks. Where it differs from many similar spots is that here the service is sprightly and sincere and the welcome is warm.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Tortoise_Club-399964-41102
15,Gilt Bar,Cuisine Gastropub,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","In the shadow of Merchandise Mart, it's not easy to miss the revolving door entrance to Gilt Bar, a moody and imposing River North favorite. The bar up front mixes cocktails to a metronomic rhythm, while the back is more intimate with brick walls, studded leather banquettes, and nostalgic lighting. However make no mistake: this is no Bugsy Malone speakeasy, but a grown-up version for bar-flies with astute palates. Snack on creamy burrata and shaved ham finished with a swig of extra virgin olive oil before savoring tender, flavorful pork meatballs on a bed of wilted kale with romesco and almond gremolata. In the end, gorge on an unctuous brown butter-apple cake with salted caramel and vanilla ice cream-perhaps to the dulcet tunes of Bob Dylan. Bliss.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Gilt_Bar-295699-41102
16,Travelle,Cuisine Mediterranean,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"This contemporary Mediterranean dining room shares its home-a landmark Mies van der Rohe tower completed in 1972-with The Langham hotel. Floor-to-ceiling windows on the second floor space offer views of Marina City, but with its stunning kitchen displayed behind gradient glass panels, the scene inside is equally dramatic. Creative add-ins bring flair and flavor to flawlessly executed and gorgeously composed dishes. A perfect, toothsome champagne risotto is enlivened by juicy, barely pickled grapes and toasted Marcona almonds, while a thick, creamy tranche of seared salmon rests on ""healthy"" fried green farro, finished with a tangy drizzle of spicy soy-mustard. Raspberry coulis and meringue shards are an ideal garnish for a fresh and zesty citrus tart.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Travelle-410317-41102
17,C Chicago,Cuisine Seafood,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"This spacious looker lands in River North courtesy of the team behind the popular Chicago Cut Steakhouse. At C Chicago, the focus is on fresh-make that really fresh-seafood. This is exciting news: there aren't many seafood restaurants in Chicago, and the few that exist aren't doing it like the talented Chef Bill Montagne, who hails from the piscine temple, Le Bernardin. Kick things off with a beautiful scallop carpaccio kissed with olive oil, lemon juice, basil, chives and Espelette pepper. Then nibble on an irresistibly chewy farro salad, served warm, tossed with charred corn, mustard greens, and topped with whipped feta. The baked Aleutian cod, arriving in a perfectly subtle Basquaise sauce and dotted with squid ink and red wine vinaigrette is sublime.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-C_Chicago-478767-41102
18,Celeste,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Celeste celebrates the city's close relationship with that great American institution-the bar. It is a veritable fun palace evoking the great drinking establishments of the last century and is spread over three floors. On the first floor is a bar with an abbreviated menu. On the second floor is the narrow and nominally named Deco Room where the marble-topped tables face another bar; and upstairs is reserved for private parties. The food is certainly more than a mere addendum to the terrific cocktail list and the kitchen is clearly a skilled one. Dishes are quite elaborate in their construction-order lamb and you may find it includes the loin, belly and sweetbreads- and they are as flavorsome as they are attractive.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Celeste-448336-41102
19,Slurping Turtle,Cuisine Japanese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Simple standard.","Both turtles and noodles symbolize longevity, so a meal at Slurping Turtle should add a few years to your life (and warmth to your belly). Inside the minimalist bento box of a space, diners sit elbow-to-elbow at sleek white communal tables. Boutique Japanese beverages like Hitachino Nest beer and Ramuné bubble-gum soda bring smiles to patrons in the know. Along with deep, steaming bowls of ramen and udon, the lengthy menu serves small plates, sushi, and other Japanese comfort food for snacking and sharing. Tender ribeye and chicken skewers arrive moist and glistening, straight from the binchotan charcoal grill. Deep-fried Brussels sprouts are crispy outside and tender inside without a hint of grease, topped with sliced scallions and fried shallots.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Slurping_Turtle-366460-41102
20,Paris Club,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Some of Paris Club was commandeered to create a ramen spot next door, but in return for this munificence, it got a first-rate makeover. Dressed in red leather seats, wood panelling and globe lighting, it perfectly captures the look of a traditional Parisian brasserie. The only thing missing is insouciant service and someone with a dog on their lap. The menu is unapologetically Gallic, ""Le Prime Steakburger"" notwithstanding, and all the classics are present: from fruits de mer to steak frites and baba au rhum. The pommes purée is so wonderfully buttery you'll need a defibrillator on standby. The wine list is all French too. On the second floor find Studio Paris, a proper nightclub with bottle service and celebrity DJ appearances.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Paris_Club-333101-41102
21,Ramen-san,Cuisine Asian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"Lettuce Entertain You brings you bowlfuls of ingredient-driven noodle soups served up right next door to the restaurant group's Paris Club. The menu at this Asian concept revolves around a handful of tastefully crafted broths dancing with thin, wavy noodles produced by Sun Noodle. The tonkotsu ramen is a traditional pleasure afloat with sweet slices of chashu, wakame, and molten egg. Meanwhile, the smoked brisket ramen is a novel departure defined by a black garlic-enriched chicken broth and slices of Bub City's 18-hour brisket. Ramen-san's loyal following is comprised of hipsters and suits alike, and they all seem to dig the salvaged look and booming playlist. Night owls take note: Japanese whiskies rule the bar and fried rice is served late into the night.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Ramen_san-448337-41102
22,Sixteen,Cuisine Contemporary,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"Two MICHELIN stars: exceptional cuisine. Worth a detour! 





Excellent standard. Our best addresses.","This bold setting puts the Chicago River, Tribune and Wrigley buildings at your fingertips from the sixteenth floor of the Trump Hotel. The lobby entrance is as unremarkable as the dining room is dramatic, centered around an enormous Swarovski chandelier that hangs like an inverted wedding cake over a curving wall of African rosewood. Beyond this lies a kitchen that takes itself very seriously, but that's ok. Chef Thomas Lents' cuisine is extraordinary, accomplished, and even more of a draw than the décor. Meals here are very conceptual and include head-spinning affairs that articulate a theme, like the ""Faces of Sixteen"" as an homage to inspirations and employees. This may translate as a tribute to Joël Robuchon through a pot of wonderfully smooth, raw and seasoned langoustine artfully topped with gelée and sea buckthorn. Another theme ""Food in Progress, Modern Fine Dining: Moving Forward with Respect to the Past"" ponders the emergence of the Nordic through a gently smoked oyster, flavorful potato gelée, horseradish, and caraway. Grilled lobster with uni, coffee, and rice is downright unforgettable. Desserts like lemon tart with diplomat cream and fennel are as innovative as they are delicious.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Sixteen-366459-41102
23,Hubbard Inn,Cuisine Mediterranean,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard. Our best addresses.,"Handsome from head-to-toe, the Hubbard Inn takes the idea of a classic tavern and dresses it to the nines. Brass-clad globe lights glow above lacquered plank tables in the front bar room, leading to tufted leather couches and fireplaces in the book-lined and Hogwarts-worthy library. The second floor is low-slung and loungy. A wall-sized chalkboard behind the marble bar whets whistles with descriptions of house cocktails. Shareable farm-to-table dishes appeal to nearly every appetite. Kale salad, that ubiquitous menu staple, gets a new twist when tossed with pickled blackberries, candied walnuts, and grated ricotta salata. And, a quartet of juicy, beautifully cooked lamb chops over rustic chickpea purée is brightened by a handful of chopped olives and mint.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60640-Hubbard_Inn-333099-41102
24,Bub City,Cuisine Barbecue,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Bub City isn't as far south as Nashville or Memphis, but the country music vibe comes through just the same at this barbecue- and booze-focused hang. Two bars flank the main stage that hosts nightly live entertainment. One bar is a shrine to over 100 varieties of whiskey, and the other to beer-easily identified by the American flag made from empty cans stacked behind its counter. Along with the extensive lineup of traditional smoked brisket, ribs, and fried chicken, a raw bar brings chilled seafood refreshment before spicy cheese-stuffed Texas Torpedoes and loaded hot link sandwiches. A bowl of Smokie's chili arrives with a kick from sliced jalapeño, but the caddy of barbecue and hot sauces on each table lets heat fiends intensify the seasoning.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Bub_City-399959-41102
25,Everest,Cuisine French,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Very good standard. Our best addresses.","Summit the historic Chicago Stock Exchange building via a private elevator to reach the sophisticated-though not outdated-scene at Everest on the 40th floor. The sunken-level dining room stays dimly lit by contemporary circular metal light fixtures, all the better to gaze admiringly at the views from the windows framing the formal space. Heavy white linens and abstract bronze sculptures adorn each table, at which smartly-dressed guests take it all in. Alsatian chef Jean Joho keeps to the French tradition on his degustation and prix-fixe menus, with nods to local ingredients among the classical techniques and pairings presented nightly. Where other chefs may feel the need to update and tweak time-honored dishes, Everest celebrates its classics. Subtle hints of ginger in a rich Gewürztraminer butter sauce complement succulent chunks of fresh Maine lobster. Two thick, bone-in lamb chops, ringed elegantly with flavorful fat, are tender but never too chewy, their richness amplified by delicate, silken spring garlic flan and a bed of crisp green beans that soak up the thyme jus. Cap it all off with tart and sweet pistachio vanilla succès dabbed with ruddy rhubarb jam.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60605-Everest-269317-41102
26,Bottlefork,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Bottlefork, Forkbottle-yup, we get it, it's a ""bar & kitchen"" but, in this case, a very good one. The narrow room is dominated by a 40-foot bar which morphs into an open kitchen. The lights are turned down and the music is turned up-and unless they know Big Audio Dynamite, it's not music for kids. When it comes to the food, ""locally sourced and globally inspired"" is their USP with the chef, a Four Seasons alumnus, making much of his largely European peregrinations. Expect punchy flavors, teasing combinations, clever twists, and everything from salumi and tuna crudo in a jar to ""popcorn"" sweetbreads, pastas, and Moroccan stews. The terrific cocktail and drinks list covers all bases too. And who isn't tempted to take dessert in liquid form?",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Bottlefork-448335-41102

Good standard.","This jewel in Bayless' culinary crown welcomes a rush of serious eaters and canoodlers for original south-of-the-border fare-with an upscale twist. While it may share an entrance and bar with sibling, Frontera Grill, that is where the likeness ends. Walk past a sliding door to enter this elegant, terra cotta-lined dining room, which feels worlds away from the fiesta upfront. Lunch is notably laid-back, but chatty, over-eager servers turn dinner into a more exhaustive experience. Enduring their descriptive chalk talk may feel a bit like sitting through a college lecture for some, but be patient as you will be rewarded with exceptional food boasting a panoply of flavors, colors, and textures. A trio of ceviches highlighting albacore, tomato, and olive; Yucatecan shrimp and calamari; and tuna coctel make for divine starters. And, the sopa seca de fideos, tossed in a saucy tomato-morita broth and fortified by chorizo, crema, and Brussels sprouts, is perhaps the best in the country. Desserts are flagrantly inventive and the strongest element of this epicurean show. A torta de elote or warm corn cake with golden corn ice cream, cherry preserves, and salty caramel corn is absolutey fantastic.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Topolobampo-269297-41102
28,Coco Pazzo,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Vibrant blue-and-orange awnings help Coco Pazzo make its mark among the area's stellar restaurants, though their reputation for seasonal Tuscan cuisine has been going strong since 1992. Navy velvet curtains that hang in the wide, welcoming, high-ceilinged room may dampen the din, but not the enthusiasm from regulars ready for a delicious mid-day tavolata and bottle from the all-Italian wine list. Business types fill every seat for the piatti unici, a chef-chosen lunch special that changes daily but is always made with expert care. Selections may include Rushing Rivers trout over lentils and spinach paired with speck- and mushroom-studded risotto made with Carnaroli rice. Dinner options like pancetta-wrapped quail with taleggio fondue showcase the kitchen's ambitious side.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Coco_Pazzo-281093-41102
29,Frontera Grill,Cuisine Mexican,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","The linchpin in Rick Bayless' empire, Frontera Grill is decidedly unique in its homage to regional Mexican cuisine and displays a near cult-like devotion to local product. The service at this dining room, psychedelic in its color scheme, can verge on vapid, but find a seat on the bar side for a warmer (and worthier) experience. The ever-changing menu is cohesive with a mix of classics and specialties like sopa azteca, a nourishing pasilla chile broth poured atop crisp tortilla strips, cool avocado, grilled chicken, and jack cheese. A version of the classic from Morelia, enchiladas a la plaza are first flash-fried, then folded over seasoned cabbage, potatoes, and carrots. Pair this plate with a side of spinach in green chile and you won't be unhappy. Ever.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Frontera_Grill-299124-41102

Inside, blown-glass bouquets of light fixtures hang above communal tables, and wooden screens in intricate cutout patterns divide the lofty, airy dining room and open kitchen, where Chef Mike Sheerin and his team whip up enticing Pan-Asian fare. The affordable lunch menu features dishes like carrot salad with shaved country ham, an assertively spicy togarashi dressing, and a swipe of yuzu curd; or udon in a thickened broth with diced tofu and seasonal vegetables. Dinner entrées display more ambition, as in poached halibut with coconut, hearts of palm, and mint fumet.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60661-Embeya-399966-41102
31,Sepia,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Good standard. Our best addresses.","When a restaurant's excellence is this consistent, it should come as no surprise that the First Lady names it as one of her favorites. Set inside a 19th century print shop, the historic dining room does a fine job mixing original details with modern touches. Muted tones in the exposed brick walls and custom tile flooring complement newer elements like floor-to-ceiling wine storage and dramatic smoke-shaded chandeliers that drip with crystals. Though the décor may tip its hat to yesteryear, Chef Andrew Zimmerman's cuisine is firmly grounded in the 21st century. Whether you visit for lunch or dinner, meals here always seem to reflect the amalgam of American cuisine, with hints of Southeast Asian, Korean, and Mediterranean tastes. Potato gnocchi may seem commonplace, but this version is memorable thanks to the flawless components and rich, profound flavors of lamb sugo with crunchy bits of ciabatta breadcrumbs. Chicken here is downright exciting, served tender and crisp-skinned with a supremely buttery Albufera sauce, crumbly chestnuts, caramelized fennel, and sausage. Simple-sounding desserts keep the bar high, with offerings like toffee-coconut cake with chocolate ganache and burnt caramel.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60661-Sepia-273488-41102

The massive LED-illuminated glass hood of the showstopping robata station grabs attention in the center of the vast space, with a brigade of black-clad line cooks working the flames. For a front row seat of the action, sit at the surrounding counter topped with charred shou-sugi-ban wood. With such a prominent display, guests would be remiss not to try choices from the robata. Lightly blackened lamb chops in a sweet-and-spicy glaze are tender, smoky, and ready for dipping in crimson Korean chili sauce. A starter of plump Wagyu and kimchi dumplings nearly bursting with spicy, rich beef expertly toe the line between crispy and moist.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Roka_Akor-362553-41102

Two expansive menus-one vegetarian, the other carnivorous-encompass Indian-inspired tapas and street foods. If feeling overhelmed by the choices, stick to the chef's specialties or go for the prix-fixe and let the kitchen decide. Meaty delicacies include spice-rubbed Mysore lamb chops with pink pickled onions. Gobi Portuguese lets tart tomatillo chutney and crunchy eggplant offset sweet coconut gravy and tender cauliflower. Shahi tukra pleases the palate with crisp fried semolina cakes drenched in caramel sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Vermilion-274777-41102

The beautiful people are naturally attracted to the clubby vibe Sunda radiates, complete with thumping music and a wide range of cocktail and sake selections. The seafood is as fresh as the vibe is sultry, with numerous raw and cooked options like tempura rock shrimp tossed with candied walnuts in a creamy honey aïoli; or maki like the ""tail of two tunas"" pairing yellowfin and super white tuna with pickled jalapeños and fried shallots.

Very good standard.","There's a quiet elegance to Chef Carrie Nahabedian's dining room, a sleek, window-wrapped space with contemporary accents of concrete, wood, and greenery.

If your idea of relaxation starts with pre-dinner drinks, the sizable bar and smattering of tables in the front lounge are an open invitation to begin. Despite its understated environs, NAHA's sweeping carte of seasonally driven Mediterranean cuisine is anything but. Shining starters include succulent lamb boereg, a delicate phyllo-wrapped parcel of ground meat plated with strained yogurt, juicy red pomegranate arils, and refreshing watercress salad. Perfectly toothsome and loaded with seasonal produce, the risotto is always a hit, while entrées like pan-seared Arctic char dressed with beluga lentils, mustard seeds, and savory apple-celery broth are a breath of fresh air.

Even servers get into the spirit with white coats and skinny black ties. If you can tune out the diversions, the poster-sized menu of modern Italian antipasti, snacks, and family-style plates won't disappoint.

Named after Mary and sister, Theresa Nguyen, the lofty space belies its compact size with huge glass windows and high ceilings. Simple banquettes and wood tables are a perfect canvas for the vibrant Vietnamese cuisine that comes speeding out of the kitchen. Lunch is busy with business types ordering the likes of a fragrant, satisfying, and clear pho floating with soft noodles, bean sprouts, jalapeños, and cilantro.

This Italian-American steak joint is the real thing, and those wiseguys at the bar have been clinking their ice cubes in this wood-paneled room for decades. The historic spot, founded in 1941, is boisterous downstairs with the aforementioned regulars and guys grabbing a bite; upstairs is more refined for local politico lunches and a bit of old-school romance at dinner. Gene & Georgetti is a steakhouse with an Italian bloodline, prominently displayed in the heaping helping of fried peperoncini and bell peppers with the signature ""chicken alla Joe."" The cottage fries (oversized potato planks that come with most entrées) might necessitate a doggie bag, but all the better to leave room for a slice of classic carrot cake.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-Gene_Georgetti-274764-41102

The windowed white room is mod and minimalist, allowing the artistry of the Mediterranean-influenced menu to shine brightly at each table. With Tony Mantuano overseeing the kitchen, Italian influences find their way into many seasonal dishes.

The stunning beer hall-meets-art nouveau interior (think reclaimed wood beams, stunning tiles arching over a semi-open kitchen, sky-blue tufted leather couches and Persian rugs) is worth a visit alone. No detail is overlooked. Delightfully, the food is amazingly tasty and just as pretty to look at. Don't miss the open-faced schnitzel sandwich, highlighting juicy pork over apple and kohlrabi slaw, aged Gouda, a fried egg, and drizzle of coarse mustard. Also a must do?

Mediterranean flavors factor prominently in the kitchen's stimulating creations, like a kale and carrot salad dressed with delightfully herbaceous and spicy green harissa as well as sunflower seeds for crunch.

Servers don stylish hairdos and tattoos to match the vibe while attending to the giant room scattered with seats and a coffee bar dispensing excellent local brews. Meanwhile, the menu veers from creative to quirky with pleasing results. A spring pea soup highlights aroma, flavor, and texture when shot with mint, ricotta, and croutons.

Though Benny's steaks are the draw, those prime cuts of filet mignon and ribeye are matched by fresh seafood like simply roasted bone-in halibut fillet and classic raw bar towers, along with a variety of pastas and salads.

Good standard.","The bright, very contemporary boxy white façade is a brilliant contrast to its somewhat missable street-just as it has been since its 1997 opening. Inside the white and steel space, find clean lines and a modern aesthetic that moves from the black-and-white artwork to the bare tables and vases that seem to pop with colorful flowers. Service can be brusque, but that never seems to deter the crowds from packing in. Expect a wait. A strong sense of style extends to the cuisine; this is a serious kitchen with an eye on artistic detail and elegance. The à la carte menu may offer dishes like duck rillettes spread on a sunflower seed cracker studded with poppy, raw sesame, and pumpkin seeds as well as compressed apple for a tart counterpoint to the rich duck. Meaty abalone mushroom confit is served with tiny and delicate sweet potato tortellini, braised mustard greens, and green apple in a soy-kissed broth.

Live lounge music may take the level of conversation up a notch, but sip on a shaken martini to blank out the surrounding din. Steaks on screaming hot platters come unadorned unless otherwise listed, and servers will happily rattle off recommendations for toppings, sauces, and crusts. Salads like Mastro's house version, a local favorite stocked with chopped jumbo shrimp and a giant steamed prawn, are hearty (read: oversized), but smaller portions are on offer so you can leave room for the renowned butter cake.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Mastro_s-333100-41102

Good standard.","Quaint seaside shacks have nothing on this urban spot that exudes nautical chic. A boomerang-shaped communal table by the raw bar makes a perfect oyster-slurping perch. Lead fishing weights keep napkins in place on nautically styled, brass-edged tables, lined up under an enormous chalkboard-style mural of a jaunty swordfish skeleton. Pescatarians savor the numerous seafood dishes meant for sharing, but those who forego fish are limited to three meat options. Rectangular crab cakes, stuffed to the gills with sweet meat, get a crunchy sear on all sides. Salade Niçoise spotlights pristine slices of fresh tuna and snappy green beans in a cider-mustard dressing. Key lime pie, a traditional meal-ender, is transformed into light layers of curd and cake in a glass jar.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-GT_Fish_Oyster-337554-41102

Hushed and intimate, the dining room is awash with a palette of soothing greys and dressed up with herringbone floors along with black-and-white photography. Brindille's menu isn't a sequel to NAHA's contemporary Mediterranean fare, but instead bears a strong Parisian accent influenced by the chef's love of French cuisine. Roasted chestnuts are whirled into a creamy soup and poured over compressed apple, wild mushrooms, and puffed rice. Spot-on Dover sole meuniere is plated with a purée of watercress and golden-crisp pommes rissolées.

This eponymous diner is by no means an elegant affair, but thanks to its delicious omelets and iconic crowd, it has been on the Windy City's must-eat list since 1923. Don't panic at the length of the lines: they are long but move fast, and free doughnut holes (one of the restaurant's signature baked goods) make the wait go faster. Back to those omelets: they may be made with mere eggs, like everyone else's, but somehow these are lighter and fluffier, almost like a soufflé, stuffed with feta, spinach, onions, or any other ingredients of your choice. They arrive in skillets with an Idaho-sized helping of potatoes. The best part?

Excellent standard. Our best addresses.","Ask a passing foodie to name one of Chicago's most elegant and sophisticated restaurants and they'll probably say Grace.

You'll be presented with a choice between two seasonally changing menus: ""Fauna"" or, for vegetarians, ""Flora."" Opt for the wine pairings and you're done on the decision making for the night. Trying to keep track of the ingredients of each dish will nullify the benefit of the wine, so instead just marvel at the clever presentation and dig in-because taste is what this food is all about. The dishes are intricate and elaborately constructed, with herbs playing an integral part rather than merely being a garnish. Occasionally your taste buds will get a little slap, perhaps with the odd Thai or Vietnamese flavor, and the courses will fly by.

Thanks to truly top-notch ingredients, simple dishes like poached veal tongue with spicy giardiniera and caramelized onions stand out on the menu.

Inspired by a Chicago beef, this ciabatta roll is moistened with jus, stuffed full of pork, and dressed with sweet peppers and spicy-tangy giardiniera.

A glass of Amarone with a dry-aged Porterhouse is always a slam-dunk, but the kitchen also turns out pleasing modern twists on steakhouse classics. Chicago's famous Italian beef gets an upgrade with smoked ribeye and aged provolone.

The hangar-sized space is three operations in one: a café for pastries and casual bites; a bar; and a full-scale restaurant. Though the décor takes cues from French brasseries, the menus have a decidedly Italian focus. No matter where you're seated, you can sample the quality imported salumi and formaggio selections like Parma ham and Granduca pecorino, accompanied by charred bread and sharp chutney. Neopolitan pizzas, fritto misto, and house-made pastas like bucatini all'Amatriciana don't disappoint, and tiramisù gets a new twist in a mélange of velvety smooth chocolate mousse, espresso-infused mascarpone, and coffee-soaked cake cubes.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Labriola-471940-41102

The all-American menu offers a wide selection of top-notch beef and hearty sides to match. Skewered cubes of maple syrup-smothered, black pepper-dusted bacon are a playful snack to share, a poppable prelude to the carnivorous courses to follow.

The cocktails are good, the noise levels are high, and there are more tattoos in the room than a Yakuza convention. The menu will take forever to read so just go directly to their two specialties-the assorted sushi rolls, some of which use black rice, and meats and fish expertly cooked over an open flame on the seriously hot robata. The ingredients are good and the flavor combinations don't get silly.

Late-night revelers prefer to sit at tufted leather booths or savor beers at the zinc-topped bar, rather than endure a wait for a table in the raucous space. Bartenders work just as hard as line cooks until the wee hours. The kitchen puts a highfalutin spin on simple bar eats. In-house butchers craft 32-ounce pork Porterhouses for sharing; foie gras for folding into fluffy scrambled eggs; and house-made sausages for bologna sandwiches that go well beyond a kid's wildest dreams.

Share an order of prime rib poutine among friends-it's drenched in beef gravy and pepper jack cheese-or go whole hog with the prime rib sandwich, which is hand-carved to order and presented tableside with horseradish cream and au jus.

Appropriately rustic wooden pillars and beams connect a warren of seating areas, from elevated platforms to banquettes to dim private corner nooks. A pick-your-own-protein adventure, the menu is organized by ingredient with a dedicated section for goat. Paper-thin goat carpaccio is dusted with fried capers, beads of smoked trout roe, and an olive-maple vinaigrette.

Two rooms, each equipped with a bar, make it easy to get started with a strawberry-mint margarita or Mexican beer. Don't let the name change fool you; ¡Hello Tacos! is still everything you've come to love about De Cero over the years. Tacos are made with hand-pressed corn tortillas and ordered individually, letting diners sample a range of fillings including rich duck confit and spicy corn salsa.

In addition to excellent cuts of beef, Rural Society grills up stellar Maine lobster, chicken, and chops, while the oven produces mouthwatering Argentinean pizzas and homemade-spiced sausages.

The self-described ""modern Midwestern"" menu pulls influences and ingredients from around the globe, yet maintains a distinctly American feel in dishes like cotton cake-an airy Japanese-style cheesecake kept light with streaks of persimmon jam and basil streusel. Smoky wood-grilled eggplant pairs with red pepper jam on a hearty ciabatta sandwich, with irresistibly salty homemade potato chips straight from the fryer.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Oak_Char-474207-41102

Sit at the counter to best appreciate their specialty-the Japanese art of grilling. For a good value lunch look no further than the bento boxes, but come at night and you'll be able to try a variety of grilled items where the natural flavors shine through, whether that's Wagyu beef or crab. You can also try more unusual cuts that you may hitherto have avoided, such as chicken heart or tail. The service is smiley, helpful, and sincere.

Among the terrific selection, enjoy the likes of hamachi sporting a spicy mix of shredded Napa cabbage, daikon, and red chili; or salmon dressed with a sweet ginger-soy sauce and fried ginger chips. South Pacific sea bream is deliciously embellished with a drizzle of smoky tomato and black sea salt. Those who wish to branch out from sushi should go for tako yaki (crispy fried octopus croquettes), grilled hamachi collar, or a brownie-crusted green tea-cheesecake.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Sushi_Dokku-408504-41102

Diners sup among a Disney-fied décor of faux-terraces and balconies, overhangs topped by terra-cotta tiles, and a trellised ceiling entwined with artificial greenery. The chance of a courteous someone whose name ends in ""os"" attending to you is good, but it's the food that has kept the joint hopping for more than 40 years. Salads are crisp and refreshing, pan-seared cheese is flambéed tableside, and the fresh seafood doesn't disappoint: fish are grilled whole, filleted, and dressed simply with herbs, a few glugs of olive oil, and squeeze of lemon.

The bulk of the sprawling space is devoted to Green Street Smoked Meats, a barbecue joint where crowds of cool kids sit side-by-side downing beers and heaps of pulled pork, brisket, and Frito pie. More worthy of attention, however, is High Five Ramen, a downstairs nook where the queue for one of its 16-seats starts early. Once inside, slurp a bowl of the signature, crazy-spicy broth. Loaded with thin alkaline noodles, a slow-cooked egg, roasted pork belly, locally grown sprouts, and black garlic oil, this unique rendition is worth the burn. For sweet, icy relief, sip on a slushy tiki cocktail-then wipe your brow and dig back in.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-High_Five_Ramen-474209-41102

Sit at the long wooden bar or in one of the well-appointed dining rooms for a second glass chosen from the long list of frizzante and spumante wines. Hearty dishes spanning the many regions of Italy cut through the heady bubbles. Carpaccio selections include the classic air-dried bresaola as well as whisper-thin seared rare duck breast.

Inside, splashes of red-and-white allude subtly to those classic red-sauce joints complete with checkered tablecloths, but glossy ceramic-tiled columns and Italian stone floors up the ante. Rome and its surroundings inspire the menu and all-Italian wine list. Local Slagel Family Farm's beef becomes carpaccio, shingled on the plate and drizzled with tangy mustard aïoli, fresh parsley, and celery leaves.

Consistently packed, the AvroKO-designed space boasts numerous kitchens churning out a wide range of dishes. Creative bites abound in the chef's omakase featuring torched baby squid wrapped in nori. Then a Hawaiian seaweed salad with diced nopales may be tailed by robata-grilled Wagyu skirt steak with foie gras, shisito pepper, and yuzu kosho.

Named after the villa where the Rolling Stones recorded their iconic Exile on Main Street, this West Loop rock star-decked out with a lacquered ivory bar, marble staircase, and antique chandeliers-feels like a playground for the glam. Vases of dried lavender evoke scents of the Mediterranean, as do the kitchen's creations, which feature homemade ravioli filled with favas, a poached egg, and parmesan broth. A hearty and succulent Berkshire pork chop with sweet roasted yams and spicy grated horseradish needs no sides; whereas black pepper semifreddo between chocolate shortbread is particularly memorable when paired with red wine-poached pears.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Nellcote-369072-41102

Good standard.","Don't be fooled by the aged patina of this sexy boîte: though a few items like the overstuffed curio cabinet and salvaged French metal chairs are true antiques, this chicly disheveled hang has been hiding out on West Randolph for only a few years. Contemporary and classic cocktails like a violet-tinged Aviator are served in champagne coupes, adding to the vintage atmosphere. Head to the second-floor bar to snack on oysters and frites, or fill up on Francophile comfort food under the glow of mismatched crystal chandeliers. Juicy, garlicky Toulouse-style pork sausage is served whole over bacon-stewed lentils, and smashed potatoes are rich with chicken jus.

Dramatic backlighting, colorful mosaics, and modern stained glass brighten the narrow, high-ceilinged space. The kitchen hums along in time to music bouncing off polished concrete floors. Simple comfort food goes upscale with the kitchen's cleverly deconstructed dishes. A breakfast-for-dinner twist on salmon becomes a perfectly seared fillet atop a dilled cream cheese ""schmear;"" an everything bagel tuile and onion jam drive the point home. Chicken noodle soup becomes pillowy mousseline-filled agnolotti on a bed of sunchoke purée and roasted carrots.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-_-graham_elliot_Bistro-373581-41102

The glassed-in pie kitchen in the back hints dessert won't be an afterthought. Choose your own adventure when building a burger, starting with a six- or nine-ounce grass-fed beef patty and adding toppings like Midwestern cheeses, smoked bacon, jalapeños, or homemade pickles. If a wedge of strawberry rhubarb pie or Bourbon-spiked milkshake is calling your name (especially when freshly churned ice cream is involved), go easy on those hand-cut farmhouse chili fries.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Grange_Hall_Burger_Bar-369071-41102

Good standard. Our best addresses.","The phrase ""meat market"" has many connotations at The Publican: everything about this bustling Fulton Market spot is communal, from the sprawling U-shaped table that dominates the space and the penned-in booths lining the perimeter to the sink outside the washrooms. That said, the ubiquitous pig-centric décor gives a more straightforward idea of what you'll find on the menu. As expected, pork takes precedence here with rillettes, platters of paper-thin aged ham slices, and house-made blood sausage to pair with one of the superlative beer selections. Weekend brunch gets in on the game with thickly sliced Publican bacon basted with Burton's maple syrup, or savory mushroom-and-chard French toast topped with roasted tomato and a fried egg.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-The_Publican-273498-41102

Owner Mary Beth Liccioni welcomes all as if they were old friends, seating guests among the graciously arranged fresh flowers, framed artwork, and linen-topped tables. Though the fragrant herb-loaded lavash presented at each table is good enough to make an entire meal out of, save room for entrées like grilled Scottish salmon, served medium-rare with a colorful, flavorful mélange of beets, cucumber, and black olive tapenade.

The lunch buffet lets you eat your fill for under $12, with crispy pappadum, baskets of fresh naan, and must-have curries like the Nepalese khasi ko maasu with chunks of bone-in stewed goat in a velvety cardamom- and black pepper-sauce.

Though the à la carte menu offers Northern Indian dishes brought to the table in shiny copper vessels, the lunch buffet covers all bases with vegetarian, chicken, and lamb items.

Excellent standard.","Fine dining at Tru has a strong air of formality that extends from the service team to the moneyed, well-dressed clientele. Beyond the discreet exterior, find an intimate lounge with a spotlit and vivid blue sculpture. Decorative branches and net curtains divide the cavernous space; while white walls adorned with Warhol lithographs lend a luxe-gallery feel. Leather and velvet banquettes surrounding well-spaced tables are popular for quiet gatherings or romantic interludes. The variety of dining options begins with an excellent prix-fixe, extending all the way up to a deep-pocketed caviar selection. However, the menu fulfills its literal promise of exploring Chef Anthony Martin's very modern kitchen. Superlative talent is abundantly clear in the smooth and silky foie gras covered in a thin shell of sugar and counterbalanced by segments of blood orange. Succulent and pearly white halibut is seared to perfection and seasoned with a warm, chive-infused cream sauce, while Berkshire pork is the center of an impeccable presentation of ""petit vegetables"" including brilliantly crisp and tender peas.

Despite its chi-chi surroundings at the Essex Inn across from Grant Park, this is an understated modern diner, serving up affordably priced bistro fare from morning to night. The croque monsieur is a totem of indulgence, layered with ham and béchamel, then lavishly buttered for grilling and blanketed with melted cheese. Skin-on pommes frites pair pleasantly with the sandwich, but grilled Caesar salad drizzled with a garlicky dressing is slightly more inculpable.

Exposed brick, rough-hewn wood, and wire-encased filament bulbs make it the quintessential modern tavern. Highlights of the harvest headline each course. Whole-grain mustard dresses up a vibrant (and requisite) beet salad. Nueske's bacon is the star in a rustic BLT, accompanied by Klug Farms peaches tossed with balsamic dressing.

Giordano's menu includes your typical salads, pastas, et al., but you'd do well to save room for the real star: the deep-dish. Bring backup because this pie could feed a small country. The spinach version arrives on a buttery pastry crust, filled with spreads of sautéed (or steamed) spinach with tomato sauce, and topped with mozzarella and parmesan.

A lengthy communal table and open kitchen with a chef's counter offer multiple opportunities for meeting, greeting, and eating. Cocktails like the Surfer Rosa, which balances tequila and mezcal with blood orange and chilies, loosen-up diners jonesing for big flavors. When hunger strikes, caramelized onion sabayon, potato confit, and garlicky pea shoots add depth to an Arctic char fillet. And lest you forget dessert, Bourbon-pecan bread pudding set upon flash-frozen vanilla cream and drizzled with sea salt-butterscotch sauce, is meant for sharing-or not.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-The_Dawson-436448-41102

The Peninsula people sensibly realized that honesty was best when naming this vast space which looks remarkably like...a lobby. At least the friendly staff manages to wrestle back some control, and you know your conversation won't be overheard-because there aren't any tables near you. So why the recommendation? Because the food is very good. The lunch menu doesn't really get past lobster rolls and chicken legs, but at night the kitchen's innate skill is very much in evidence. Dishes are good-looking, but also have depth and ingredients are of irreproachable quality. Flavors marry well and there are intriguing touches of originality but never at the expense of the overall balance of the dish.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-The_Lobby-399962-41102

Inside, they are welcomed by a palette of rich, cool hues, crystal-beaded light fixtures that hang overhead, and an open kitchen boasting a wood-burning oven. Piccolo Sogno's rustic, yet refined menu offers traditional dishes with a twist. A version of the ubiquitous beet salad (both red and golden) is elevated here by shaved fennel, a drizzle of bright citrus oil, and a dollop of creamy, lush buffalo milk ricotta. If you need further encouragement, let us recommend the rabbit. Braised in a white wine sauce redolent of rosemary and lemon, the tender meat is served with wilted escarole and porridge-like semolina pudding.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60642-Piccolo_Sogno-274770-41102

The affordable lunch menu features dishes like carrot salad with shaved country ham, an assertively spicy togarashi dressing, and a swipe of yuzu curd; or udon in a thickened broth with diced tofu and seasonal vegetables.

However, solo diners may rest assured as they can order personal pies from a walk-up counter. The walls, scribbled with years of graffiti, are nearly as iconic as the high-walled pies themselves, whose crusts get their signature crunch from cornmeal and searing-hot metal pans rife with two inch-high sides. Filled with heaps of mozzarella and toppings like the ""Meaty Legend"" lineup of spicy pepperoni, Italian sausage, and both Canadian and regular bacon before getting sauced, it's hard to eat more than two wedges here. Nonconformists can of course opt for thin-crust pies, gussied-up by add-ons like roasted red peppers.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Gino_s_East-436454-41102

Like a stylish private club but without the centuries of stuffiness, RL offers options for a quick solo lunch, cocktail at the mahogany bar, or full dinner. The odd Blackhawks jersey here and there doesn't detract from the overall aura. The menu is as classically American as the name, featuring bistro favorites like Waldorf salad and raw bar offerings alongside well-prepared dishes like sweet and plump pan-seared scallops with white balsamic-crème fraîche. The thin, flaky crust of a goat cheese- and caramelized onion-tart nearly steals the show from the rich atmosphere of the wood-paneled dining room.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-RL-273486-41102
97,NoMI Kitchen,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"A hushed aerie awaits on the seventh floor of the Park Hyatt at NoMI Kitchen. Let the dapper staff whisk you through the hotel lobby and elevator to a glassed-in dining room with Water Tower views. A semi-open kitchen doesn't detract from the lush but restrained décor, and a breezy terrace offers an alfresco option with a different menu. Chef Ryan LaRoche's impressive, ingredient-driven dishes are equally inspired by Eastern and Western cuisines. Fresh fish makes for a seaworthy selection of sushi and maki, while pickled pepper jam and sweet pine nut streusel pair with orbs of fried caponata-style eggplant that are crispy on the outside and perfectly silky within. End with a parade of house-made ice cream flavors like toasted vanilla marshmallow.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-NoMI_Kitchen-273481-41102
98,La Sirena Clandestina,Cuisine Latin American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"A relaxing Caribbean vibe breezes its way northward to Fulton Market and settles within La Sirena Clandestina's aquamarine walls. Languidly spinning fans, light filtered through antique etched glass panels, and an international selection of sippable rum and mezcal all conspire to bring guests' blood pressure down a notch or two. Baked empanadas rotate through a series of fillings, but these popular pockets never leave the menu. Whether stuffed with venison ragù or ricotta, hazelnut, and butternut squash, they're all exceptional. Handfuls of Manchego add decadence to plump bomba rice studded with fiery pickled jalapeño rings, toasted pepitas, and buttery white corn. Classic alfajore shortbreads filled with dulce de leche and sea salt are a memorable send-off.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-La_Sirena_Clandestina-409369-41102
99,NEXT,Cuisine Contemporary,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Good standard.,"Welcome to dinner as theater, where the only thing more radical than each new theme is the success (or failure) of the cuisine. Next's conceit is reinvention. It may begin the year as, say, a culinary homage to French ""Bistro"" cooking with hit-or-miss fare that does little to underscore the kitchen's strengths. The long, dark, windowless room reflects that theme with a smattering of typical trappings, like chalkboard specials on the wall and little ceramic roosters on the table. Some concepts may be rooted in regional innovation, offering an array of Spanish ""Tapas."" Months later, the chefs may craft small plates with an eye on wine and global ""Terrior."" This is a very unique place with an adept and dexterous kitchen, but the experience just isn't for everyone.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-NEXT-410318-41102
100,Eleven City Diner,Cuisine Deli,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"Nosh on a mile-high sandwich or chocolate malt at Eleven City Diner, a modern revival of the classic Jewish deli. Gleaming subway tiles play off retro leather booths and swiveling barstools, while jazz in the background keeps things moving with chutzpah and finesse. Diner standards include patty melts, sandwiches piled with corned beef or pastrami, knishes, and latkes. Bubbie's chicken soup comes bobbing with a fluffy matzo ball the size of a baseball; while Junior's cheesecake from Brooklyn or a triple-decker wedge of red velvet cake sates all the sweet-loving guests. A full-service deli counter offers salamis and smoked fish to-go. For a true blast from the past, stop by the candy stand near the entry stocked with Bazooka Joe and other favorites.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60605-Eleven_City_Diner-268991-41102
101,Bistronomic,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Tucked away from the buzz of the Magnificent Mile, Bistronomic is a great place to cool your tired heels. Jaunty red awnings beckon brightly, and the revolving door spins guests into a warm room that's focused on the bonhomie of dining with friends. Oxblood walls, gray banquettes, and a central bar play up the bistro feel, while the kitchen conveys creativity with fresh renditions of tasty classics. Rusticity and elegance come together in a fillet of Lake Superior whitefish that is pan-seared to golden-brown and matched with spring ratatouille, preserved lemon, and puréed eggplant. Exquisitely crisp feuilletine is a glamorous upgrade to the classic Kit Kat bar, folded with hazelnuts, bittersweet chocolate, and finished with a sweet-tart orange sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Bistronomic-333086-41102
102,La Sardine,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"In a neighborhood packed to the gills with gastronomic innovation, La Sardine may be the most daring option of all, flaunting hearty French bistro food in a warm and rustic setting. The time-tested combination of wheezing accordion music, white linens, tile floors, and pastoral murals makes it all the rage among diners craving the familiar-and a $30 lunch prix-fixe doesn't hurt either. From escargots and steak tartare to bouillabaisse and steak frites, Chef/owner Jean-Claude Poilevey nails the classic bistro dishes. Don't miss the steak haché, a patty of excellent ground beef seared to perfection, then topped with smoked goat cheese and plated with truffle-laced Bibb lettuce, a thick slice of maple bacon, and crunchy fried onion rings.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-La_Sardine-273457-41102
103,mk,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"After nearly two decades in business, larger than life ""mk"" still welcomes all to Chef/owner Michael Kornick's eponymous flagship. Rich brown tones warm up the former paint factory's lofty interior, which features a skylit space that's beloved citywide for big nights and romantic evenings. There's a seasonal dish here to sate every appetite, whether diners are seated at linen-draped tables or perched on sleek stools in the lounge area. Bar bites offer upscale indulgences like bison sliders tucked into bone marrow-buttered focaccia, while a dual preparation of tartares-yellowfin tuna with Moroccan olives complementing Scottish salmon with charred red onion-could be a meal on its own. For dessert, citrusy ""Where troubles melt like lemon drops"" is every bit as charming as its name.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-mk-269222-41102
104,Pizano's,Cuisine Pizza,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"While Chicago may be hailed as home of the deep-dish pizza, the thin-crust pies at Pizano's have justly earned their own devoted following. This refreshing and cozy local spot recalls Italian-American style without feeling like a chain-restaurant cliché; even the waitstaff's genuine warmth is palpable. Of course, the crowds come for the crust-here it is flaky, buttery, thin (by local standards), and perfectly crisp. As unexpected as it sounds, their pizzas are some of the best in town. And yet, it should be no surprise as pizza has long been the family calling: owner Rudy Malnati's father founded Pizzeria Uno. The ""thinner"" offspring at Pizano's sates its growing fan-base from three locations, and even ships to those far from the Second City.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-Pizano_s-326628-41102
105,Vera,Cuisine Spanish,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,,"Pimentón de la Vera, one of the most powerful spices in Spanish cuisine, also provides partial inspiration for this first-come, first-served wine bar in the West Loop dining corridor. (The other homage? Chef/owner Mark Mendez's grandmother.) Exposed brick walls and walnut floors are typically lovely, but do little to soften the din of a happy hour crowd after a few glasses of sherry. Classic tapas as well as ham-and-cheese flights comprise the menu, along with larger plates like a piled-high paella with rabbit, duck, and chorizo. Shell out a few extra dollars for crusty bread to sop up the garlicky, lemony olive oil that bathes their plump head-on shrimp. Grilled rounds of octopus are sweet and smoky thanks to a liberal dose of good old pimentón.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Vera-362556-41102
106,Café des Architectes,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"European sophistication lends extra polish to this shimmering contemporary spot in the Sofitel Hotel, where ""Bonjour"" is passed around freely by the mostly French staff. The dining room is just as chic, with crimson banquettes, black-and-white portraits of the city's architectural marvels, and floor-to-ceiling windows with striking steel accents. The seasonally shifting lineup of small plates is simple but creative, like a single Wianno oyster dabbed with fennel cream and crowned with spoonfuls of both sturgeon and faux citrus caviar. Market-inspired entrées include butternut squash ribbons curling over tender beef short rib and vanilla-tinged salsify purée. For a more casual, small bites affair, move to Le Bar, the hotel's chic watering hole.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Cafe_des_Architectes-268982-41102
107,deca,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Part of the Ritz-Carlton's expansive 12th floor lobby, deca is a casual haunt that still keeps a few high-end accents around. Paintings hung in gilded frames add to the attractiveness in the seated dining area; and a gently trickling sculptural fountain (illuminated by a skylight) offers an auditory escape from the lobby's background buzz. The well-edited menu features light, seasonal dishes that are skillfully prepared. Two large pillows of freshly made squash ravioli are garnished with hearty kale pistou, pickled wild mushrooms, and toasted pepitas. Wild salmon with a crunchy mustard crust is bathed in luxurious garlic-red wine jus. Finish in style with a wedge of tangy lemon tart decorated with fresh raspberries and set atop a neat pool of coulis.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-deca-289574-41102
108,Tête Charcuterie,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"No greater respect can be shown to a former meatpacking warehouse than by converting it into a restaurant specialising in charcuterie. This most ancient of culinary arts is joyfully celebrated here in all its forms-there are cured meats, wonderful glistening terrines, rich pâtés, and plump homemade sausages. This is roll-your-sleeves-up food that will put hair on your chest. The enthusiasm of the on-view kitchen team is palpable. Curing is done in-house and there's a separate Sausage Room where they create their own varieties, which range from a French boudin blanc to Moroccan inspired merguez. But don't think they can't show a light touch when required: the ""spring garden"" served en cocotte is one of the prettiest things you'll see.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Tete_Charcuterie-448338-41102
109,Pelago,Cuisine Italian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"Adjacent to Hotel Raffaello, the elegance of this brick structure is accentuated by large arched windows. Inside, the bi-level room wears a crisp style à la high ceilings, eminently comfortable leather seats, and a soft azure-blue color scheme. If the décor doesn't transport you to the Mediterranean in a flash, look to the regional Italian menu with ingredients imported directly. A salad of plum tomatoes topped with creamy burrata and fragrant basil in a light dressing is as inherently satisfying. So, too, are pasta signatures including rich risotto alle verdure or creamy ricotta-filled ravioli swimming in a vibrant sauce of spinach and showered with slivers of nutty parmesan. Swap dessert for a fine selection of imported cheeses, and never look back.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Pelago-273483-41102
110,Vora,Cuisine Asian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Whether you're a carnivore, herbivore, or somewhere in between, Vora's plethora of Asian offerings aims to please. The modern space puts nature at the forefront with vine-like clusters of light bulbs snaking above bars, room dividers punctuated with floral cutouts, and sprightly lime-green banquettes. Can't choose from the health-oriented lineup of Taiwanese dim sum, Indian curries, or Chinese classics? The dim sum box is actually a bento offering a dizzying array of multi-cultural tastes: soft shrimp siu mai, juicy xiao long bao, steamed pork buns, and miso soup, as well as other bites. Slices of Sichuan beef and vegetables stir-fried with chili sauce can be amped up to match Chinatown's level of heat, or toned down to suit milder tastes.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-Vora-436450-41102
111,Spiaggia,Cuisine Italian,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Very good standard. Our best addresses.","This modern bi-level dining room showcases subdued shades of gray, an intricately tiled marble floor, and spacious seating that only money can buy. Its views of the lake and Magnificent Mile are just as priceless. Glass ""caves"" for wine and cheese, and charcuterie served at the bar whet the appetite. The kitchen reflects its elegant surrounds in treating each meticulously sourced ingredient with care, respect, and talent. Modern twists are clear throughout the menu, yet Spiaggia remains a very classic Italian restaurant. This is immediately evident in pasta courses such as the springy and resilient fresh tajarin; the thin and pale yellow noodles are twirled with a none-too-buttery sauce and generous shaving of fragrant white truffles. ""Little hats"" or cappelletti are stuffed with duck confit, leeks, and Parmigiano, then served in a rich duck consommé amid poached egg and dehydrated hen of the woods mushrooms. Venison with white truffles, chestnut purée, and tart macerated mulberries is amazingly delicate on all levels. Finish with puffs of blood orange meringue with pine-rosemary essence and pine-nut brittle. Ignore the occasional trip-ups and upsells; dining here is a true culinary journey.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Spiaggia-273490-41102
112,Cafe Spiaggia,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"After an extensive renovation, Cafe Spiaggia is sporting a sophisticated, contemporary new look, with beautiful white tufted leather banquettes, dark wood tables, and black-and-white photos gracing the wall. Towards the back, leather stools line a long white marble bar, and majestic floor-to-ceiling windows offer views of Magnificent Mile. The menu is solid and approachable Italian-a decidedly less formal alternative to sophisticated older sister, Spiaggia, next door. Kick things off with the piadini, a thin Romagna-style flatbread, grilled and folded around delicious fillings like mortadella, maybe a caprese, or even chicken and honey. Then, slide on over to the kitchen's focus-gemelli humming with summer beans, preserved lemon, Pecorino Romano, and Prosciutto di Parma.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Cafe_Spiaggia-268981-41102
113,Nico Osteria,Cuisine Italian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Buzz around Nico Osteria has already reached deafening levels, especially since this Paul Kahan spot isn't tucked into a gentrifying corner of the city, but situated smack dab in the center of the chic Gold Coast. Communal bar seating keeps the space humming with energy, but moody lighting conspires to keep the vibe relaxed. Though billed as Italian-inspired cooking, the kitchen takes liberties with traditional dishes on the seafood-heavy menu. Well-grilled and generously oiled sourdough fett'unta topped with combinations like baccalà and Dungeness crab are rustic introductions to the meal. Ask for more bread to soak up the Neapolitan-style ragù-a skillet bubbling with goodies like a swordfish meatball and slabs of grilled pork belly in a tomato gravy.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Nico_Osteria-436449-41102
114,Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Housed in a sprawling setting adjacent to big brother Gibson's, Hugo's always seems packed. The vast dining room sets white linen-topped tables amidst dark polished wood and pale walls decorated with a mounted swordfish, fish prints, and model ships. Hugo's bar draws its own crowds with abundant counter seating. The menu focuses on a selection of fish preparations as well as steaks and chops. These are supplemented by stone crab claws, oysters, crab cakes, chowders, and sautéed frog's legs. Speaking of frog's legs, the restaurant takes its name from the nickname of owner Hugo Ralli's grandfather, General Bruce Hay of Her Majesty's Imperial Forces. Bring a football team to share a slice of the Muddy Bottom Pie, a decadent (and enormous) ice cream cake.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Hugo_s_Frog_Bar_Fish_House-289559-41102
115,Merlo on Maple,Cuisine Italian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Inside a graciously decorated Victorian townhouse, Chef/owner Luisa Silvia Marani proudly showcases the bounty of her native Bologna with an Emiliana-inflected accent and delicious Northern Italian fare. Her frequently changing roster of luscious dishes are edible billboards for the foods of the region-think mortadella di Bologna and tartufi neri del'Umbria. Rabbit ragù clings to delicate parsley-flecked bow tie pasta tossed with Parmigiano-Reggiano and copious handfuls of butter. Wine-braised bone-in lamb shank, served in its own rich sauce, needs little else to shine. Signature budino di mascarpone, cioccolato e caffé is the standard-bearer for proper tiramisù, accompanied by tart sugar-coated red currants to offset the creamy sweetness.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-Merlo_on_Maple-294709-41102

Simple standard.","This urban interpretation of a Midwest tavern was set up by two owners, features two chefs, second-hand furnishings, and an address whose last digit is-you guessed it-the number two. Step past the vintage Toledo scales to arrive at this reclaimed wood-paneled space dressed with antique meat cleavers, quaint ceiling fans, and large barn doors. If that doesn't scream farm-to-fork cuisine, consider what's being whipped up in the open kitchen (the banquette across from it affords the best view): a ramp raviolo filled with ricotta, a perfectly cooked hen's egg, and enhanced by brown butter and shiitakes; or a halibut fillet with cherry tomatoes and asparagus. On the sweet front, homemade puppy chow is chilled, crisp, and delicious with a uniform sugar dusting.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60642-TWO-438105-41102
117,Tuscany on Taylor,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Italian and Chicago accents co-mingle at Tuscany on Taylor, where the classic cuisine and service are perfectly old-school (no pun intended-the university is a few blocks away). The formal staff tends to diners at white linen-topped tables in the terra cotta-tiled dining room. Chefs in puffy toques man the open kitchen amid shelves of polished copper pans. A wide-ranging menu of modern Italian interpretations takes guests on a whirlwind tour of the boot. Tiny ravioli stuffed with roasted pears are set in a densely flavorful mascarpone cream sauce with toasted pine nuts and strips of sundried tomatoes. A simple caprese salad arrives as three stacks of thickly sliced heirloom tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, and basil pesto drizzled with balsamic reduction.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Tuscany_on_Taylor-289558-41102

Suits, locals, and Gold Coast power shoppers populate the tables from lunch through dinner, as white-aproned waiters happily uncork bottles of rouge et blanc. Don't look for modern surprises on the menu; contentment here is attained through uncomplicated but expertly prepared French dishes from frites to frisée. Whole trout, pan-fried until golden and napped with butter sauce, hits all the right notes; while daily standards like croque monsieur or French onion soup are enhanced by more ambitious monthly specials.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-Bistrot_Zinc-281106-41102
119,Kurah,Cuisine Middle Eastern,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"The phrase ""small plates"" doesn't always translate to ""great value,"" but Kurah offers an exception to the rule with its affordable selection of shareable, Middle Eastern-influenced dishes. Featuring Arabic-inspired wallpaper and upholstered seats, the setting is as warm and cozy as the open grill blazing away in the kitchen. Build a meal from hot and cold tapas options like muthowma, a blend of silky potatoes and whipped garlic that's perfect for scooping onto warm pita bread. Larger meat platters like a single juicy lamb and beef kifta kabob, served with roasted vegetables and golden saffron rice, make a hearty meal for one. For dessert, dark chocolate oozes invitingly between layers of phyllo and crushed walnuts in a tasty twist on classic baklava.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60605-Kurah-410933-41102

Southern charm permeates every inch of the room, from the pressed-copper ceiling to the white sideboards to a wood-burning oven churning out the restaurant's signature biscuits. The meal might get started with an amuse-bouche of deviled eggs topped with pickled mustard seeds, and if it's a Sunday or Monday, the famous fried chicken will be making an appearance on many plates. Plump fried green tomatoes and thick pork chops are on order, but for a true down-home taste, get a tall wedge of hummingbird cake, fragrant with banana and pineapple and slathered in cream cheese frosting.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-Table_Fifty_Two-269254-41102

Elegant preparations elevate traditional barbecue elements, like a spicy pairing of cornmeal-dredged fried green tomatoes and habañero-glazed pork belly with red onion-mango relish. Baby back ribs-so tender they're practically falling off the bone-are served with a trio of house-made sauces for dipping and slathering. And pig lovers planning for a large party can order a whole pork shoulder carved tableside with a picnic-worthy spread of slaw, beans, and cornbread.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-Chicago_q-326626-41102
122,Riva,Cuisine Seafood,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"If a stroll along Navy Pier works up an appetite, follow your nose (and stomach) past the Ferris wheel to Riva, a nautically themed escape from the carnival atmosphere. The upstairs dining room is a visual feast, with colorful murals above the open kitchen and sweeping lakeshore views; while a casual café downstairs serves drinks and light bites. Though the menu swims with seafood, Prime steaks and Italian-inspired dishes like pear-and-cheese agnolotti offer variety. Caper-studded Louis sauce augments a single plump cake of jumbo lump crab with a crisp side of Asian slaw. A fillet of Atlantic salmon is placed atop a vibrant plate and paired with cherry tomato fondue, a handful of quartered Brussels sprouts, and bite-sized potato gnocchetti.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Riva-269234-41102

The cozy room features an open kitchen where pie production is on display for all to see. And in a playful bit of recycling, empty tomato sauce cans on each table become stands for sizzling pizzas churned straight from the 800-degree F coal oven. This hot spot has its ratio down to a fine art and knows not to burden its thin, crispy crust that's blackened and blistered in all the right places. The mortadella is a delight, with chopped garlic and gossamer slices of peppercorn-flecked sausage. Care to go your own way? Build the perfect pie with toppings that run the gamut from Gorgonzola to goat cheese. A second location in Lakeview continues to thrive.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Coalfire_Pizza-268986-41102

Taxidermied pheasants keep watch over the room from their high perches, like a Deyrolle curiosity. The kitchen gives classic French cuisine a soupçon of international embellishment. Three plump scallops spooned with basil pesto are set over a pool of tomato coulis for a Franco-Italian take on coquilles St. Jacques. A simple Caesar salad benefits from fresh ingredients like tender grilled chicken and crisp romaine lettuce in a garlicky dressing.

A wall-length horse-themed screen separates the restaurant from casual sister spot Urban Belly, which shares the open kitchen. As imagined by prolific Chef/owner Bill Kim, the Asian barbecue experience at BellyQ takes its form in a number of genre-melding shareable plates. A side of bibimbap-style sticky rice is crunchy and tender, tossed with glistening slices of Chinese sausage and generously sprinkled with togarashi. Chewy chunks of brownie in vanilla soft-serve are drizzled with caramel-balsamic-soy ""Seoul sauce"" for a savory twist.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-bellyQ-399965-41102

Good standard.","Back when the Public Hotel was known as the Ambassador East, scores of celebrities clinked glasses and forks in the Pump Room. Though these memories are preserved in black-and-white photos hung throughout the hotel, today the sunken dining room is a classy, updated space where cushy circular booths, mod orbital lights, and brown kraft paper placemats meld flawlessly. Under the direction of Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the seasonal American menu is as casually riveting as the décor. An amply sized boneless fried chicken breast is moist and flavorful beneath its shatteringly crisp coating, ready to sop up habanero-infused butter sauce.

The menu is anchored by a number of inventive pastas prepared in-house, like charred fennel-stuffed tortellini bobbing in a boldly seasoned porchetta brodo hit with fennel pollen and garlic-mustard oil. Unbelievably tender grilled octopus is plated with beef-braised carrots and fried bone marrow-enriched romesco; and the honeycomb-topped chocolate tart tastes as silky as a bowl of pudding.

Follow this with hamachi served as a brilliant study of flavor and balance, showcasing silky and beautifully marbled fish, placed on a bed of coconut-infused rice pudding with dabs of black garlic, bits of finger lime, and lemongrass-spiced chutney. Genius and luxury are at play in the sinfully rich Australian Wagyu beef, served red and fleshy with classic Bordelaise, roasted maitake to magnify the umami, chunks of sweet lobster, and lobster foam to lend an ocean-like airiness to the plate. Finish meals on a smooth and fudgy note with chocolate pudding cake accompanied by coconut gelée for striking visual contrast, a swipe of caramel, rum ice cream, candied black walnut, and toasty little slivers of fresh coconut.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60616-Acadia-366449-41102

130,Three Aces,Cuisine Gastropub,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Look past the fact that Three Aces is a bar-a hip, dimly-lit, rock n' roll-loving bar at that-and you'll find a soulful kitchen with a deft hand at turning out Italian riffs on American farm-to-table cuisine. Inventive combinations are the order of the day on both the food and cocktail lists; the Fiery Jalesco gets motors revving with a delicately smoky blend of mezcal, St. Germain, and grapefruit aromatics. Many dishes beg for sharing, like the Calabrese pizzetta that heats things up with spicy sausage and red chili flakes. Roast beef panini takes its cue from Chicago's famous Italian beef, its pressed sourdough slices are slathered with aïoli, packed to the gills with tangy giardiniera and provolone, and served with garlicky beef jus.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Three_Aces-326625-41102

Take a gander at the nightly ""smokin' specials"" or choose from an already impressive lineup of slow-smoked ribs, wings, and other tasty bits.

Recipes passed down through generations highlight fresh vegetables and healthy fare. The salsa with house-made corn chips as a starter changes every day, but each variety is a pleasure. Hominy stew with roast pork is traditionally garnished with shaved raw cabbage, radish, and red onion in pozole and then sprinkled with cucumber salsa for a fresh take; while boneless guajillo-marinated pork loin chops gain sweetness from grilled pineapple.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60609-DeCOLORES-296425-41102

Wide wood plank floors and a windowed façade open up the cozy space, flooding the length of the bar with light-and a semi-open kitchen turning out ambitious seasonal dishes emphasizes that this is much more than a wine bar. Quality ingredients and technique are on display in compositions like Indiana-farmed rabbit loin tucked with black pepper and glazed with blueberry and rhubarb demi-glace to balance sweetness and spice.

Creamy hen of the woods mushroom pâté, served with caramelized Vidalia onion marmalade and toasted bread, ensures that no one misses the meat.

The original location of what is now an extended family of restaurants throughout Chicagoland, it's nothing if not classic with its red neon sign, dark carved wood, and cool but accommodating all-male waitstaff. Italian wedding soup brings comfort with moist, tiny meatballs, escarole, and acini di pepe simmered in broth; while sweet sausage chunks, caramelized onions, and a garlicky white wine sauce make chicken giambotta a satisfying choice.

A large rear window offers a glimpse of Chef Carlos Gaytan at work in the kitchen, and congratulatory graffiti from visiting chefs provides a fun distraction on the way to the restroom. Many of Mexique's contemporary Mexican dishes are inspired by classical French techniques. From the platos fuertes, the mar y tierra is a delightful composition of Michoacán-style braised pork belly over silken sweet potato purée dressed with a complex dark mole prepared from over 20 ingredients; sea scallop with bacon-apple jam and pickled onions complete this intoxicating one plate feast.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Mexique-273477-41102

The banquet hall-style room is grand and formal, complete with crystal chandeliers and professional service. To say there's a lot to choose from is an understatement, as there are nearly 100 rolled, crimped, steamed, and fried dim sum options alone. Highlights include flaky puff pastry turnovers filled with sweet and savory barbecue pork; and large lotus leaves that envelope tender sticky rice mixed with chicken, liver, and crab. When the dim sum parade ends at 4:00P.M., the menu shifts to an equally vast selection of Cantonese dishes like crunchy stir-fried lotus root with ginger.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60616-Cai-366450-41102

And even Frontier's menu drives home the hunt-and-gather theme, with dishes divided into three sections: ""Fried,"" ""Foraged,"" and ""Whole Animal Service."" Carnivores revel in the chef's signature duck tacos juiced with salsa verde, while pescetarians beg for crab Benedict-a superb staple of toasted muffins with sweet crabmeat, soft poached eggs, and spicy Hollandaise.

Up a few stairs, a stainless steel communal table offers a view into the semi-open kitchen. Meals usually start with popcorn seasoned with changing flavors like sesame and seaweed-a preview of the menu's mix of American and international ingredients. A fresh oyster trio gets three distinct garnishes: sambal-pickled ginger, tangy apple mignonette, and pork belly with a smoked aroma revealed by lifting a glass cloche. Seared scallops and pork carnitas meld with black raisin emulsion.

The proof is in the soft and poppable shrimp-and-chive dumplings and the fluffy white buns stuffed with chunks of barbecue pork. Those looking for larger portions will appreciate the meandering menu, which also boasts Hong Kong-style stir-fry and clay pot dishes alongside Americanized Chinese classics.

Though the bar is wall-to-wall on weekends, most weekdays are low-key, with families and groups ready for a casual night out. Fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs are the real deal, made with a sweet and spicy rub, served with their own ""zesty"" sauce or the newer Prohibition version, with brown sugar and a hint of ghost-pepper heat.

But hot is a double entendre here, and a crimson-themed décor along with mod acrylic chairs printed with chili peppers clues guests in to the kitchen's propensity for spicing things up. If the book-length menu seems overwhelming, scan the list of favorites at the beginning for a quick pick-be sure to avoid any items marked with a chili if you'd rather walk on the mild side. As for the hits, chili oil and peppercorns give numbing heat to crunchy, translucent sheets of beef tendon, and succulent Xinjiang-style cumin lamb is generously coated in cumin seeds and tossed with fresh, zippy ginger.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60616-Lao_Sze_Chuan-269209-41102

Spacious dining rooms separated by wooden lattice panels offer seating for a number of occasions, from casual booths and large banquet-style rounds to specially outfitted tables for hot pots.

A crimson kimchi jjigae broth, seamlessly balanced between sour and spicy, bobs with soft chunks of tofu and pork. Bibimbap sizzles in a stone bowl, letting the requisite crispy crust form on the bottom while diners dig into a mountain of glistening sweet soy kalbi, crunchy vegetables, and fried egg.

Though the rollicking bar up front takes its cues from a swinging Wild West saloon, the rear dining room offers a more sedate-though still eclectic-setting for sipping house cocktails and chowing down on sensational smoked meats. You'll need two hands to hold homemade empanadas stuffed with combinations like Manchego cheese and shiitake mushrooms, and extra cottony white bread to soak up the juices of bone-in, wood-smoked chicken. Brisket chili is even more robust with a scoop of creamy mac and cheese-and if you're still hungry, soda floats with Bridgeport-made Filbert's root beer are the cherry on top.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60608-Honky_Tonk_BBQ-471938-41102

Knowledgeable, on-point service makes the meal even more divine. Start with a choice from the large vermouth selection and a round of burrata with pickled mustard seeds and fresh mint, ready to be piled on lardo-brushed toast.

Then consider the fact that the owners of Longman & Eagle are behind this operation and know that you're in for some seriously unique and outstanding eats. Housed in a booming, hipster-centric corner of the lower west side, this stylish public hall has major cool factor and enough real estate to be a triple threat. Framed by windows, the dining room is on the main floor while the upstairs (Thalia Hall) is a live music venue. Service throughout is very cordial, so settle in and await a spread of quirky American food. The menu changes daily so don't get hung up on favorites. However, smash-hits may include a wood-roasted cheese-stuffed pretzel coupled with wasabi dipping sauce as well as an ultra-decadent blue crab dip paired with artichoke relish and crusty, house-made pain d'epi. Live out your gourmet gastropub fantasy with slow-cooked salmon sporting a salty crust and spiced with salsa verde; or gnocchi tossed with lamb Bolognese and creamy ricotta.

Whole ginger- and garlic-glazed grilled squid is sliced into rings, then sprinkled with scallions and creamy jalapeño sauce. Succulent robata-grilled skewers, purchased by the piece, arrive with specialized accompaniments like marinated pork shoulder with sweet chili sauce or kalbi-glazed short rib.

Excellent standard.","Who needs a meal followed by a show when you can have both together? That's because eating at Alinea, which involves around 20 courses over about three hours, is more than simply dinner-it's culinary theater. Perhaps it could qualify for a Tony Award along with its Michelin stars, because you're even invited backstage afterwards to meet the talented protagonists in the kitchen. Alinea provides such a vivid, visceral experience, that you'll even forget about the somewhat painful and entirely inhospitable booking procedure. Neophytes have nothing to fear here as there's a veritable army of charming, clued-up helpers and servers to guide you effortlessly through each and every dish. And guidance is certainly needed because the only menu you'll see is the one presented to you like an award certificate as you leave. The cooking is strikingly original and very clever. It can surprise but it can also challenge; at times dishes can be playful or even whimsical. But underpinning all those clever techniques and all those dazzling arrangements and quite striking presentations is an inherent understanding of flavor-and this is what gives the cooking such great depth.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Alinea-268970-41102

Against dark pebbled walls, find oversized horseshoe booths, long banquettes, and mirrored light bulbs casting funky shadows. The semi-outdoor solarium has a living wall of moss and ferns. Servers are friendly and genuine without a hint of pretense. This is the kind of place where one can sink in and not care to leave. Chef Lee Wolen's menu may be modern, but it is widely appealing with a Mediterranean edge. Begin with translucent slivers of fresh sea bass that get a pleasant chew from almond crumble and perfect flavor from a subtle dab of citrusy yuzu kosho. Then, deliciously tender and evenly pink Colorado lamb is served with a harmonious hodgepodge of creamy yogurt, charred lettuce, and nearly sweet baby potatoes. For dessert, an airy and whipped mound of praline-flavored mousse is set beside milk ice cream, which serves as a cooling counterpoint to the nutty flavors throughout and makes for a fine ending.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Boka-268977-41102

Those who do step inside the flagship come for the convivial vibe and, of course, pizza. Of the many options, the deep-dish is Miss Popularity, but it's fun to go one further with a stuffed pizza topped with a buttery crust. The garlic- and oregano-laced sauce is pleasantly tangy, and carnivores sing the praises of Connie's plump fennel sausage.

The décor is cutting-edge, but the menu respects and returns to Italian standbys. Gnocco fritto, a dough pillow served with charcuterie, is irresistible to even the most willowy fashionistas; while cracker-crisp artisan pizzas from wood-burning ovens are equally pleasing. Traditional involtini di pollo, pounded thin and rolled around prosciutto, gets a hit of brightness from lemon and white wine sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-tocco-296390-41102

Look at the colorful chalk-drawn mural above the kitchen, depicting Spanish scenes, products, and food terms, to get a sense of what's on offer. Shareable plates mix tradition with contemporary twists, like crispy hollowed-out patatas bravas filled with ketchup and aïoli. A half-dozen pickled mussels arrive in a tin beneath a layer of creamy potato foam; while an excellent consommé poured over a farm egg yolk and truffles is brightened by a dash of manzanilla sherry.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Black_Bull-373412-41102
162,Pl-zeň,Cuisine Gastropub,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"The beckoning tentacles of an enormous octopus painted on a brownstone point the way to this quirky subterranean spot. More murals lead diners down a brick-lined alley and into the dining room, where the dim space is lightened by blonde wood bar stools and a hospitable vibe from the cool young staff. Though both chilaquiles and sesame-crusted tilapia tacos find their way on to the menu, Pl-zenˇ offers a full slate of gastropub fare that steps away from the traditional Mexican bent of the neighborhood. Raisin- and pignoli-studded boar meatballs are simmered in tomato sauce and finished with ricotta and caramelized onions. A poached egg adds richness to crispy pig ear salad with Fresno chili aïoli. Cinnamon-sugar beignets deserve a dip in luscious strawberry-pinot grigio sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60608-Pl_zen-399956-41102
163,Mott St.,Cuisine Fusion,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Simple standard.","New Yorkers know Mott St. as the bustling artery in the heart of Chinatown, but to Chicagoans the name connotes something off the beaten path. Inside the low-slung, standalone red structure, a chicken wire-caged pantry is stocked with jars of red pepper, black vinegar, and other pungent edibles-all of which appear again in the food on your plate. Offerings at this hip haven crisscross the globe, melding diverse ingredients for an utterly unique dining experience. Shredded kohlrabi substitutes green papaya for a Thai-inspired salad tossed with candied shrimp, poached chicken, and plenty of fresh herbs. Stuffed cabbage bears a Korean accent with tender chunks of slow-braised pork, tangy Napa cabbage kimchi, and crunchy sticky rice.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Mott_St-409363-41102
164,Mana Food Bar,Cuisine Vegetarian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Simple standard.","Feeling like your body needs a jump-start? Mana, whose name translates to ""the life force coursing through nature,"" is a good place to get your mojo back. Though welcoming to vegans, vegetarians, gluten-free diners, and anyone who's looking for a nutrient boost, it's not just health food: the small space also offers a full bar with sake cocktails, smoothies, and freshly squeezed juices. Mana may be a tiny spot, but its diverse menu of vegetarian dishes is big on taste-and spice. Korean bibimbap mixes a roster of vegetables like pea pods, roasted carrots, and pickled daikon with a fresh sunny side-up egg; while horseradish and cracked black pepper sneak into macaroni and cheese. House-made hot sauce with serranos and jalapeños adds extra pep to any dish.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Mana_Food_Bar-269218-41102
165,Kokopelli,Cuisine Mexican,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"This Wicker Park taqueria is the next best thing to a getaway from the shores of Lake Michigan to the Pacific Coast of Mexico. Sure, it's north of the border, but the cooking is as authentic as it gets. Inside, the space is warm and comfortable with bar seating aplenty, bright green banquettes, and an accent wall painted a shade that can only be described as Baja blue. Seafood is the focus of the unique menu, and octopus reigns supreme. The eight-armed delicacy works its way into a number of items including pulpo ceviche and the Kraken taco, which features a grilled, pesto-marinated version. Equally excellent are the poblano tacos stuffed with smoked rainbow trout, charred corn, and a creamy salsa made from roasted pumpkin seeds and Serrano chiles.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Kokopelli-473931-41102
166,Smoke Daddy,Cuisine American,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"After a renovation doubled the size of this barbecue joint and live music venue, it's become easier to grab a bite of burnt ends and a touch of the blues. The original room still oozes soul and smoke from its brick walls and vinyl floor, while the new space is bright and airy with a retractable glass door leading to an umbrella-shaded patio. No matter which barbecue style you pledge allegiance to-Kansas City, Memphis, or Carolina-you'll find something worth gnawing on, from moist pulled pork and chicken to spare and baby back ribs. Order any sandwich ""Daddy Style"" to get a few slices of brisket slapped on top, or fill up on jalapeño cornbread. Fans of the in-house Bloody Mary mix should grab a bottle to-go, along with smoked pig ears in a true doggy bag.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Smoke_Daddy-281119-41102
167,Summer House Santa Monica,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Sunny days and southern California come to Lincoln Park in the form of this bright and breezy restaurant that resembles a beach house, albeit an enormous one with lots of house guests. It's the perfect choice for a summer's day-and not a bad one in the colder months, either if you're having a quick bite before the theater or want to shake off those winter blues for a while. There's even a countdown showing the number of days till summer. The menu proves a good fit for the surroundings by keeping things easy. There are sandwiches, tacos, and salads, but it's the meat and fish from the wood-fired oven that stand out. For dessert, choose a big cookie from the counter by the entrance. There's also a pizza restaurant and bar attached.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Summer_House_Santa_Monica-448334-41102
168,Briciola,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"After decades of cooking and traveling, Chef/owner Mario Maggi was ready to open a small place-just a crumb, or ""una briciola,"" of a restaurant. This tiny trattoria nestled between Ukrainian Village's brick buildings is indeed a speck of warmth and charm, festooned with party lights on the patio and mustard-toned walls inside. Traditional Italian cuisine gets personalized tweaks from the chef. Carpacci may include paper-thin octopus, beets, or beef; macaroncini alla Briciola folds diced Tuscan sausage into a spicy garlic-sage sauce; and a hefty bone-in pork chop, pounded thin, breaded, and pan-fried until golden, is a house classic dressed with arugula and shaved parmesan. A bottle from the wine shop down the block makes the meal even more convivial.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Briciola-373413-41102
169,Ada St.,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Despite its obscure location among the industrial warehouses of far-east Wicker Park, adventurous diners have no trouble seeking out Ada St. Reservations aren't accepted after 6:30 P.M., so the cozy, brick-walled lounge quickly becomes a party space where patrons peruse the wooden cubbies of vinyl to create their own soundtrack. The menu of small plates is influenced by both hearty gastropub dishes and lighter Mediterranean bites. Tabasco mash ketchup heats up a plate of charred, tender octopus, while a poached egg gilds rich duck confit tossed with cavatelli. Even the snappy green beans need nothing more than Dijon butter to shine. Before you take off, show your appreciation by choosing the last item on the menu: a six-pack of beer for the kitchen staff.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Ada_St-373410-41102
170,Schwa,Cuisine Contemporary,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Simple standard.","There comes a point when pared-down style jumps from being easy-to-miss and becomes hard-to-forget (think security grills on the façade). When a utilitarian and self-consciously bare interior seems modern and industrial. When temporarily disconnected phone lines and full mailboxes make every hipster in the room feel like he hit the jackpot to score this reservation. The booming hip-hop peppered with expletives reflects the deeply talented chefs' ethos, going well beyond laissez-faire to reach the point of ""we don't give a damn."" That said, you probably won't either. The food really is that good. The 14-course nightly tasting has no menu really to speak of, but there are plenty of tattooed servers ready to describe each dish with details that come at you rapid fire. While some courses may seem way out of balance in terms of flavor and textural complexity, others have been known to show nuance and delicacy-as evident in the smooth and fine Osetra caviar sitting in a mélange of cashew nut purée, tender hearts of palm, and fried plantain chips; or a single quail egg raviolo with its glossy and unctuous brown butter sauce. Desserts can be pure genius, beginning with watermelon ice and unagi ice cream-a sprinkle of togarashi perfectly foils the intensity of this treat.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60662-Schwa-269239-41102
171,Taus Authentic,Cuisine International,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"You'll want to make an evening of it at this Wicker Park newcomer, where a stylish front lounge-complete with a working fireplace-makes for a cozy spot to enjoy a beer or cocktail. Then you may proceed to linger over a meal in the beautiful dining room, a modern vision of wood, powder blue velvet, and plate glass windows. Chef Michael Taus has designed a menu made for grazing: think charcuterie, cheese, and starters including a sunchoke dosa. Made from lentils and basmati rice, this lacy crêpe is topped with chunks of tender sunchokes in a spicy red curry sauce sweetened by golden raisins and candied pumpkin seeds. A tasting portion of pan-seared fluke, plated with sweet chili vinaigrette and a Korean-style pancake studded with dried shrimp, is equally delicious.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Taus_Authentic-473932-41102
172,Gemini Bistro,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Opposites attract at this delightful neighborhood bistro that offers the best of both worlds: a chic, upscale setting with a casual, approachable attitude. Dark Venetian blinds and awnings remove outside distractions, letting guests focus their attention on the white marble bar and the lychee martinis shaken there. Most street parking in the area is permit only, so consider the valet. Seasonal American cooking pulls inspiration from the Mediterranean in dishes like plump double-boned pork chop Lyonnaise, cooked to a juicy medium, draped in herbed demi-glace, and nestled with cipollini onions and roasted fingerling potatoes. Smaller bites like a trio of seared scallops are paired with the timeless flavors of brown butter, capers, and lemon zest.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Gemini_Bistro-337551-41102
173,Antique Taco,Cuisine Mexican,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"No reservations and walk-up counter service lead to an inevitable wait at Antique Taco (wear comfortable shoes). Ease the pain by browsing well-curated racks of knickknacks while awaiting market-fresh Mexican food, which arrives on abuela-worthy china plates. Place your order and score a wooden stool at a boxy plank table. Antique Taco piles its corn tortillas with substantial and delicious fillings. Crispy battered fish is spiced up with sriracha-tartar sauce and chilled smoked cabbage slaw. Shredded roast pork is rubbed with adobo, glazed in tamarind, and joined with creamy avocado and queso fresco for tasty carnitas. Pickled red onions add punch to chunky guacamole. Vodka-spiked agua frescas are nice, but the horchata milkshake is unmissable.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Antique_Taco-373411-41102
174,Riccardo Trattoria,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","The timeless wood-and-cream décor doesn't resemble an Italian nonna's kitchen, but no matter-the soulful personality of Chef/owner Riccardo Michi and his cache of family recipes make his eponymous restaurant a second home to nearly half the neighborhood. It's a spot that's suited for flirty date nights, boisterous dinners, and every occasion in between. As befits the word ""trattoria,"" rustic Italian preparations take precedence, but the simplicity satisfies. Chunks of pork sausage add heft to a heaping bowl of hand-rolled cavatelli bathed in a light tomato cream sauce, and curls of grilled calamari need only a squirt of lemon, splash of olive oil, and sprinkle of parsley to sing. For dessert, a thin, buttery tart shell cradles tender wine-poached pears.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Riccardo_Trattoria-294712-41102
175,Oiistar,Cuisine Asian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"It's easy to mistake Oiistar for yet another trendy ramen joint-but don't. Sure, it's got all the design hallmarks-from a minimalist wood-planked dining room and industrial open kitchen, to a turned-up soundtrack. But, the internationally influenced menu makes it much more than your average slurp shop. In fact, ""It's A Small World"" could be the unofficial theme song for their lineup of steamed buns and comforting ramen bowls showcasing noodles hand-pulled in-house each day: fiery kochujang complements barbecue chicken on the pollo bun, while the saltimbocca bun goes Italian with sage, prosciutto, and mozzarella. Extra special is the chadolmen, which blends a tangle of delicate wheat noodles with brisket and ground pork in a spicy miso and kimchi broth.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Oiistar-399943-41102
176,Cumin,Cuisine Indian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Simple standard.","This proudly-run blend of Nepalese and Indian eats sits among a plethora of bars, coffee shops, and vintage stores in boho-centric Bucktown. While fans of the sub-continent love Cumin for its clean and modern surrounds, linen-lined tables struggle to contain the myriad plates that pile up during its ubiquitous lunch buffet. Paintings of mountain scenes decorate crimson-red walls and prep diners for an authentic range of flavorful food hailing from the Northeast. Nibble on crispy samosas or onion bhajis (finely shredded onion fritters) teamed with mint chutney. Then soak pieces of buttery naan in rich and vibrant saag bobbing with soft chunks of chicken. For a sweet finale, dig into a creamy pistachio kulfi or opt for a light and fruity mango lassi.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Cumin-296384-41102
177,Takito Kitchen,Cuisine Mexican,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Chicago's upscale taco circuit gets a new contender with Takito, where fresh ingredients make Latin-inspired food sing. Tequila takes pride of place in a chile-salted margarita, while skylights and mirrors make the narrow, mod-industrial space seem even brighter and larger. Sure, you can get a corn tortilla here, but sesame and hibiscus options let the kitchen get creative as evident in tacos filled with cornmeal-crusted redfish, beef barbacoa, or tamarind-chayote pequin. Shared plates like sope de carne asada blur culinary boundaries with the addition of Brunkow cheddar and green onion kimchi. It's an across-the-board mishmash of colorful flavors, but certainly a good way to go over the top. Sister spot Bar Takito also boasts a notably concise menu.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Takito_Kitchen-399944-41102
178,Greentea,Cuisine Japanese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Regulars would rather your eyes glaze past Greentea's nondescript storefront so they can keep this secret to themselves. The bento box-sized room isn't glitzy, so the scene is limited to a few lucky cat sculptures and plants to punctuate the seafoam green walls. Otherwise, the focus is kept on the itamae in colorful chef's coats and the pristinely fresh seafood they're preparing. Purists love the well-priced nigiri, sashimi, and manageably sized rolls showcasing silky hamachi or glistening uni with a touch of minerality. Tiger Eyes salad is a visual showstopper: squid stuffed with smoked salmon, julienned cucumber, and marinated carrots sliced into thin rounds are a clever and flavorful resemblance to an orange-pupiled eye.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Greentea-362550-41102
179,Mirai,Cuisine Japanese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Mirai is a bit like Disney World. You know it's not real, but who cares? The Japanese food is westernized and by no means traditional, but unless you're dining out with Mr. Shinzo Abe, rest assured that nobody will cry foul. Bold and appetizing flavors beg to take center stage. It's really all about the fish at this spot-just look around and you'll find most devotees feasting on sashimi, unagi, and maki. If raw fish doesn't float your boat, take a shot at one of the house specialties like kani nigiri, a baked king crab concoction. There is also a surfeit of hot dishes-think chicken togarashi with spicy, sweet, and tangy flavors. Affable and alert service combined with a relaxed atmosphere make this a hit among area residents.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Mirai-281117-41102
180,Aquitaine,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"When Lincoln Park locals want French-inspired cuisine, they head to Aquitaine for a taste of Chef/owner Holly Willoughby's refined cooking. Dim lighting and subtle brocade details on the walls keep the long, narrow dining room casually romantic, with enough simple sophistication to swing a Saturday night date or weekday post-work dinner. A well-priced wine list only adds to the elegant appeal. Large chunks of succulent lobster are a luxe touch in a ramekin of tender potato gnocchi bathed in creamy sauce. Eggplant, olive, and tomato relish give double-cut lamb chops a Provençal spin, heightened by a drizzle of basil pesto. Textbook-perfect crème brûlée needs only a tap of the spoon to send its delicate sugar crust splintering into the silken custard.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Aquitaine-339783-41102
181,Mon Ami Gabi,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"A real French bistro can give an American steakhouse a run for its money in the meat department any day, and the 11 different steak preparations on Mon Ami Gabi's menu (all served with crispy golden frites) are justly impressive. Beyond the butcher case, a selection of satisfying Francophile classics keeps the sophisticated Chicago contingent returning to this cozy, stylish standby. Tradition reigns in the kitchen, where the emphasis is on flavorful and unpretentious dishes like seafood pot-au-feu bobbing with scallops and pepper-crusted cod fillet in a tasty fennel broth. Pickled cornichons and warm toast points make a meal out of house-made country pâté. And for an indulgent finish, split a plate of warm caramel-drizzled pineapple crêpes.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Mon_Ami_Gabi-294711-41102
182,Nando Milano Trattoria,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"A corner bar television constantly tuned to (European) football, vintage aperitivo posters, and a welcoming patio tailor-made for afternoon glasses of prosecco: charismatic host Dario Vullo has installed his own little slice of Milan in Wicker Park. The chic trattoria offers an intensely Italian menu and wine list to match the authentic accents of Vullo and family. A trio of arancini are playfully prepared, with each rice ball sporting a unique shape-sphere, triangle, and cube-to denote a special filling like Bolognese ragù and smoked mozzarella; or mascarpone and spinach. House-made pastas like beet gnocchi in saffron sauce steal the show from equally flavorful and fresh focaccia sandwiches layered with creamy burrata and Prosciutto di Parma.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Nando_Milano_Trattoria-408491-41102
183,Las Palmas,Cuisine Mexican,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Vivid décor complements the spirited flavors on the menu at Las Palmas, from the colorful Mexican artwork on adobe-style walls to exposed ductwork welded to resemble a scaly dragon winding through the deceptively large space. If the weather suits, the outdoor garden or glassed-in atrium beckon; if not, a cozy fireplace in the front room keeps things intimate. The cocktail menu draws inspiration from both South and Central America, featuring a variety of capirinhas and mojitos alongside inventive cucumber-lime and pineapple margaritas. Vibrant and modern Mexican dishes like crispy taquitos with chicken barbacoa, pickled red onion, and tangy salsa cruda; as well as seafood-filled cornmeal empanadas with peanut-jalapeño relish showcase the kitchen's flair.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Las_Palmas-326631-41102
184,Lillie's Q,Cuisine Barbecue,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Bucktown's urban barbecue shack takes a scholarly approach to 'cue, as each table bears a caddy stocked with six regionally specific sauces for embellishing the slow-smoked meats to come. Cocktails served in Mason jars are a specialty made from ""moonshine"" offered at three proof levels, and servers in modern mechanic's shirts tend to the crowds clamoring for heaps of smoked meats rubbed in ""Carolina dirt."" Tri-tip is tender and pink-tinged after its time in the smoker with the joint's signature dry rub; while the succulent smoked hot link rests in a butter-griddled, top-sliced brioche bun served with Southern-style coleslaw. And if at-home grilling is your thing, you'll be pleased to know that the mouthwatering sauces are available by mail order.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Lillie_s_Q-296388-41102
185,Rickshaw Republic,Cuisine Indonesian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard. Our best addresses.,"The captivating flavors of Southeast Asian street food are matched by the creative design at this friendly, family-run Lincoln Avenue space. Color and pattern collide as parasols, puppets, and bird cages vie for attention with abstract Indonesian wood carvings. Once the food arrives, though, the spotlight shifts to the aromatic plates. Start with crisp martabak crêpes that behold a savory combination of beef, onions, and egg. Then move on to lemongrass-braised chicken thighs in a turmeric-tinged coconut curry with sweet and spicy tamarind sambal and pickled cabbage. Surprise your palate with es cendol, a mix of coconut milk and green pandan jelly in palm sugar syrup. Finally, take one of Mama Setiawan's homemade sambals home to bring color to your cooking.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Rickshaw_Republic-399954-41102
186,Big Star,Cuisine Mexican,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"Bucktown's favorite taqueria has all the fixings for a fiesta. Craft beers, custom-bottled Bourbons, and pitchers of margaritas wash down the affordable abundance. And, despite the grungy décor, the vibe is as intoxicating as the aroma of the taco de chorizo verde. The patio is even more of a party, and sun-starved Chicagoans can be spotted out there soon after the groundhog has (or hasn't) seen his shadow. Tacos are served individually, thus allowing ample opportunity to graze on the likes of the pollo pibil-achiote- and citrus-marinated chicken thighs steamed in banana leaves, topped with pickled onion slices and cilantro. Save room for the salsa de frijole con queso, a crock of pinto bean dip accompanied by lime salt-sprinkled tortilla chips.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Big_Star-296345-41102
187,Taxim,Cuisine Greek,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Though Taxim channels the spirit of Greece in its food, the Moroccan-esque décor takes inspiration from Turkey and other Mediterranean coastal neighbors. The large room glints with light from hanging Moorish lanterns and copper-topped tables. Share small plates on the sidewalk patio to take full advantage of Wicker Park people-watching. Many of Taxim's dishes get a modern twist while remaining respectful to the islands' traditional cuisine. Wild Greek oregano and ouzo-preserved lemon offer a perfect balance to roasted Amish Miller Farms chicken; while loukoumades prove that no one can resist fried dough, especially when tossed in wildflower honey and topped with rosewater-infused pastry cream. The all-Greek wine list is an adventure for oenophiles.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Taxim-289572-41102

The daily special may be a blueberry quinoa pancake, while savory favorites include crunchy buttermilk fried chicken with chorizo verde gravy or the farmer's cheese-stuffed Anaheim chile relleno, served in a pool of tomato-serrano sauce with pasilla chiles and pickled chayote slices. Pies from Hoosier Mama Pie Co. are a grand finale; try the lemony Atlantic Beach with a saltine crust.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Dove_s_Luncheonette-473929-41102

Midwestern hospitality and bounty are at the forefront here, and every ingredient on each section of the multi-category menu is of irreprehensible quality. The in-house cheese-making and bread programs are on full display as evidenced in a bowl of stracciatella, where mozzarella mingles with pickled shallot rings next to fluffy, griddled focaccia sticks. A whiff of smoke uplifts moist, meaty sturgeon, simply seared and surrounded by candied hickory nuts and nutty crème fraîche; while a refined and clever root vegetable tartare is deliciously crowned by a sous vide duck egg.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-White_Oak_Tavern_Inn-474200-41102

There are fairly classic combinations of ingredients on offer, but also more challenging blends of flavor. If you can't decide then you can always ""make your own maki""-but you'll only have yourself to blame should the memory of your chosen flavors return to haunt you at a later date. The homemade steamed buns are also worthy; a filling of roasted pork belly with pickled vegetables inside one of these little pillows of delight is hard to beat. The vaulted room looks like a Goth's cellar, all black and moody, with the open kitchen at the far end shining like a beacon of hope. Larger parties should try to snare one of the low-slung booths.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60647-Enso-399942-41102

Beyond the kitchen's signature rotisserie duck for two, the menu spreads its wings with a focused but diverse selection of small plates and entrées.

Choose from a litany of salads, sandwiches, and drinks from oversized chalkboard menus behind the counter; then stake out one of the premium second-floor tables. Upstairs, chandeliers, cozy couches, and scattered antiques (not to mention frequent study groups guzzling caffeine and homemade cookies) lend character. Many sandwiches take names from literary works, like The Old Man and the Sea (tuna salad) or Catcher in the Rye (reuben). The muffuletta is a lightly pressed panini rendition of the New Orleans standard, stacking a deli's worth of ham, salami, mortadella, provolone, and mild giardiniera in fresh focaccia for a hearty yet delicate bite.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Bourgeois_Pig_Cafe-268978-41102

Housed in a former Russian bathhouse, the black-and-white tiles and notched brick walls dividing the eclectic warren of rooms give a nod to the former tenant of this 1920s building. Bar snacks and weekend brunch are taken just as seriously as full-on lunch and dinner here. Corned beef adds a manly touch to eggs Benedict, especially when drizzled with piquant choron sauce. Dense pretzel cinnamon rolls straddle the salty-sweet line.

Here, a bowl of fundido is a Latin cousin to spinach-and-artichoke dip, with a blend of tangy cheeses and plenty of roasted poblanos for extra heat. Pan-fried pork tenderloin medallions come smothered in tomatillo sauce alongside drunken beans, bacon-wrapped shrimp, and a side of smashed red potatoes with oozing Chihuahua cheese.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Fiesta_Mexicana-289560-41102

Good standard.","Free your mind, keep your expectations high, and ignore the hand-made sign and desolate locale that make this undeniably edgy restaurant feel like a David Lynch movie. No one comes here for high-end pampering. Rather, the interior is an amalgam of heavy wood timber, zinc ductwork, abstract art, and a homespun curtain made of wine corks. The open kitchen and its team of freewheeling anti-heroes lend a dinner-party vibe, with guests bringing bottles of Bourbon as gifts for the chefs and others getting up to mingle. Woe to those who come here to dine alone. This prix-fixe is an all-embracive antithesis to highfalutin fine dining, with courses that the chef might describe as salty-sweet stoner food. Envision golden-fried potatoes in a piping hot leek soup, topped with liquid nitrogen-prepared vanilla ice cream that pops and crackles when poured overtop. The result is a brilliant playfulness that hits all the right gustatory notes. Seared venison may arrive with plump morels, jicama brunoise, beluga lentils, and wonderfully bright green garlic ""slaw.""

Though known for its sushi, grilled items like juicy beef tongue complement the roster of exceptionally fresh bites. Smoky seared saba and octopus sashimi are served with typically restrained seasoning, needing nothing more than a dab of soy and dip in pickled wasabi sauce. Monthly specials may include Eskimo clouds, a poetic name for escolar-wrapped kushi oysters with Tabasco-ponzu foam.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-_-Kai_Zan-373582-41102

Both the reasonably priced à la carte and fixed menus appear simple, listing one or two main seasonal ingredients often repeated with new insight throughout a meal. However, each dish elevates farm-to-table cooking with creative exploration. This is at once clear in the ""egg, bacon,"" its velvety yolk ready to spill over and lushly sauce the roasted rapini, bacon confit, and dark slice of toasted pumpernickel beneath.

Thin slices of lamb kidney are dry stir-fried, their mild flavor boosted by copious amounts of cumin and red chilies. Then, a sweet and sour sauce offsets the funky flavor of quick-fried intestine, tripe, and liver; and pickled cabbage and pork meatball soup, boosted by tofu and noodles, is a welcome warmer on cold days.

The menu offers cool bites like the Juno queen, a special nigiri of salmon topped with spicy scallop and potato crunch; and hot treats like honey-glazed quail. Chef B.K. Park's omakase must be ordered 48-hours in advance, but with cleverly spun morsels like briefly torched prawn with pineapple salsa, pickled garlic oil-drizzled New Zealand King salmon, soy-marinated sea eel dabbed with ground sesame seeds, and spicy octopus temaki, it's a feast well worth the extra effort.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Juno-474198-41102

Locally sourced and organic are the guiding principles behind every ingredient here; many dishes also get a little Latin flavor.

227,Wood,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","The décor at this Boystown spot might be all grown-up with rich wood tones set against pale tufted booths and a glossy cream bar, but witty winks to the gay community pop up throughout the menu. Cocktails like a ""manhandled sour"" are as suggestively named as they are superbly prepared. Heck, even Sunday brunch is titled ""Morning Wood."" That said, the menu is incredibly refined. Choose from seasonal American food like roasted venison with creamed spinach as well as homemade sausage and spaetzle. Or opt for the country ham flatbread topped with creamy raclette and charred black kale, presented in squares for easy sharing. The bar continues to pour long after the kitchen closes, so night owls sample from the ""Backwoods"" menu of Belgian frites and sauces.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60657-Wood-373574-41102
228,Bakin' & Eggs,Cuisine American,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"A pastry case chockablock with cupcakes, cookies, and brownies entices passersby into this relaxed Lincoln Avenue breakfast and lunch hangout. Inside, whitewashed repurposed church pews provide ample seating for both big families as well as solo hipsters who can be seeen sipping on Intelligentsia coffee, which is on hand for a pick-me-up. As the sibling of Wicker Park's Lovely Bake Shop, it's no wonder the moist, generously frosted cupcakes take the cake. Flavors like pumpkin spice, peanut butter and jelly, and red velvet make it hard to pick a favorite. Latin influences on the savory menu mean carb-loaded and dense chilaquiles with avocado and tomatillos. A kids' menu offers mini breakfast burritos or buttermilk pancakes with whipped cream smiles.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60657-Bakin_Eggs-373573-41102
229,Milt's Barbecue for the Perplexed,Cuisine Barbecue,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Good standard.,"The full name of this kosher spot is Milt's Barbecue for the Perplexed, but even without pork (or dairy) on the menu, there's no sign of ""confusion"" among patrons, as the catalog of smoky barbecue and Jewish deli delights are bound to appease one and all. Additionally, 100% of their profits go to charity, so get in here and get your craving on. The room is simple, with dark wood furnishings and floors, but the kitchen is all sparkle. Tender chopped brisket on a toasted hamburger bun arrives with a trio of barbecue sauces-mustardy Carolina, smoky Memphis, and sweet Kansas City-and fries in a wire fryer basket; while pulled smoked chicken makes its way into the homemade soup. Don't expect to take your Friday night date here as Milt closes at sundown out of respect for the Sabbath.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60657-Milt_s_Barbecue_for_the_Perplexed-399951-41102
230,P.S. Bangkok,Cuisine Thai,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Good standard.,"Even first-timers are part of the family at P.S. Bangkok, a charming Lakeview retreat run by a trio of sisters. Wind chimes ring softly as Sue (who runs the front of the house) graciously welcomes each guest. Linen-draped tables, wooden arches, and bamboo accents lend subtle elegance to the space. Diners do double takes at intriguingly titled dishes that depart from the usual Thai menu. ""Love me tender"" duck is a sweetheart of a meal, featuring fanned duck breast slices with crackling, sugary skin in a citrus-tinged sauce. ""Beef paradise"" is marinated in garlic and spices, and served with Thai barbecue dipping sauce. Stir-fried entrées named for flavor profiles like pungent, tangy, or peppery let guests cater to their own taste buds.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60657-P_S_Bangkok-294721-41102
231,Parson's Chicken & Fish,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"For the young professionals and new families of gentrifying Logan Square, Parson's Chicken & Fish is a lively but low-key hangout that hits all the bases. It's equally appropriate for a midday snack with the kids or late-night munchies run, and the stay-and-play vibe extends to on-site activities like a winter ice skating rink or summer ping pong tables. As per the name, poultry and piscine offerings are house specialties, with signature golden-fried chicken (and equally popular Negroni slushies) on many tables. An aïoli-smeared brioche bun holds a piping-hot fillet of beer-battered fish topped with crisp slaw and house hot sauce. Dessert isn't made in house, but no matter; neighboring Bang Bang Pie Shop provides daily slices of sweetness.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60647-Parson_s_Chicken_Fish-408494-41102
232,Home Bistro,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Home dishes up loads of charm with a healthy dash of humor in the heart of Boystown. Flickering tea lights on the closely packed bistro-style tables faintly illuminate cozy orange walls painted with food-related quotes. Chef Victor Morenz's eclectic menu picks up influences from around the globe, but each dish is consistently gratifying. Southern meets south of the border in crisp fried oyster tacos with pickled pepper remoulade. Candied kumquats and olive tapenade contrast pleasantly with buttery seared duck breast, and a dense cube of warm, fudgy chocolate cake placed over a swipe of coconut peanut butter is a decadent finale. Plan for an early evening if you're looking forward to a quiet meal; at peak hours, those orange walls really reverberate.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60657-Home_Bistro-340602-41102
233,Chicago Diner,Cuisine Vegetarian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"""Meat free since '83"" is the slogan at Chicago Diner, where servers have been slinging creative, healthy fare to grateful vegetarians and vegans for decades. The ambience evokes a neighborhood diner with fire engine-red tables trimmed in chrome, shiny black vinyl chairs, and raised booths. And the food? It looks and tastes the part. Convincingly crispy seitan buffalo wings cool down the spice factor with vegan ranch dressing; while flautas filled with mashed potato, faux cheese, and jalapeños are served with tons of flavorful fixings so that the meat is not missed at all. With a popular brunch menu, numerous gluten-free choices, and a stronghold on the local vegan scene, you can expect a line. So, get there early or hope for good Karma-and a seat.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60657-Chicago_Diner-268988-41102
234,Masada,Cuisine Middle Eastern,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Good standard.,"Masada Ramli, the mother of owner Shadi Ramli, is the inspiration of this richly adorned spot bedecked with metal lanterns and colorful glazed tiles. A collection of hamsas at the entrance wards off evil, and the lower level lounge pours a bevy of sprits including cocktails, crafts beers, and arak. Although kebabs and wraps can be ordered, there's nothing commonplace about Masada's home-style cooking. Instead, imagine the likes of lamb's kidney and heart sautéed with onions and oyster mushrooms; or fetit betinjan, crunchy pita cubes and roasted eggplant dressed with tahini, pomegranate molasses, and lemon. A number of vegan options abound and attract, including koshari, a hearty mélange of rice, lentils, and gluten-free pasta, accompanied by spicy tomato sauce and tart pickles.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60647-Masada-448330-41102
235,Owen & Engine,Cuisine Gastropub,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Owen & Engine's charm extends from its glossy black façade into its warm polished wood interior and all the way to the second-floor dining room that sees action into the wee hours. Brocade wallpaper, gas lights, and studded leather club chairs lend a Victorian feel. A frequently changing draft list always features a few selections pulled from a beer cask (or ""engine""). British-inspired gastropub grub matches the impressive roster of brews and Pimm's cups. Bar nibbles like mustard-glazed soft pretzels with Welsh rarebit for dipping; or peanuts tossed in sriracha, Worcestershire, and brown sugar cater to the snacking sort. Hearty entrées like bangers and mash feature house-made Slagel Family Farm's pork sausage and potatoes smothered in onion gravy.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60647-Owen_Engine-326632-41102
236,Fat Willy's,Cuisine Barbecue,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"With piles of hickory and applewood stacked at the entrance and the sweet-spicy aroma of smoke filling the air, Fat Willy's telegraphs an authentic barbecue experience from the outset. Vintage hand mixers decorate one wall, but this isn't a precious farmhouse bakery-the meat is front and center, as indicated by the rolls of paper towels and sheets of Kraft paper laid out over gingham tablecloths. Signature baby back ribs are pink and glistening with fat after a slow smoke, and a duo of house-made barbecue sauces lets diners kick things up as desired. Minced fresh garlic adorns the pulled pork sandwich, with a few shakes of seasoned vinegar for extra oomph. After those savory indulgences, a slice of cool, creamy peanut butter mousse cake is just the ticket.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60647-Fat_Willy_s-340597-41102
237,The Radler,Cuisine German,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"With around 20 suds on tap and more than 95 bottles to sample, The Radler is everything you want a beer hall to be. Though the space is new, it has an old soul: communal benches hearken back to the days of classic Bavarian biergartens, and the enormous Bohemian Export beer mural that commands guests' attention is indigenous to the building-a happy discovery during demolition. A stack of small plates on each table sends the message that everything on the menu is meant for sharing. A German onion pie arrives straight from the oven, topped with shaved asparagus and made-to-order Pilsner soubise. Four types of wurst are available by the link, like Thüringer-served over a bed of spring green peas with authentic marinated cucumber salad and traditional mustard.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60647-The_Radler-448333-41102
238,La Encantada,Cuisine Mexican,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"Encantada is Spanish for enchanting, and this family-run spot more than lives up to its name. Royal-blue, golden-yellow, and exposed brick walls are hung with gallery-style artwork (most of which is for sale), and contemporary Latin tunes waft through the air. Culinary inspiration begins in the family's hometown, Zacatecas, but pulls from around Mexico with delectable results. Enchiladas rojas, a Zacatecan specialty, are as authentic as one could wish. Two small, salted beef-filled tortillas are draped with earthy salsa rojas for muted chili heat, while avocado and crema fresca bring depth to a rustic chicken tortilla soup. The chewy, caramelized crust on pan-fried plantains is textbook perfect, served with a dollop of cinnamon-laced cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60647-La_Encantada-339934-41102
239,Frasca,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"The warmth of the wood-burning brick oven and the list of generously priced wines is enough to entice Lakeview's young professionals into the friendly confines of Frasca. Amidst décor inspired by the restaurant's name (""branch"" in Italian), lively groups and intimate dates sample wine flights and split appetizers like charred Brussels sprouts and cauliflower florets tossed with bacon and briny capers. Chewy pizza crusts blistered from the heat of the oven are laden with market-fresh toppings. The salsiccia adds shaved pickled fennel and delicate, wispy fronds to handfuls of crumbled fennel seed sausage and pools of melted Havarti. Grab extra forks for the moist tiramisù with a generous inch-thick layer of cocoa-dusted mascarpone mousse.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60657-Frasca-281128-41102

Local products and in-house goodies are stocked in the front of the narrow space, while the rear offers comfortable banquettes for a casual sit-down meal. Breakfast is served as long as the sun shines, with options like a freshly baked and buttered English muffin stuffed with ginger-sage sausage, a vibrant orange sunny side-up egg, and sweet pepper jelly. A side of red bliss potatoes sweetens the deal, but if you're really looking for something sugary, the grilled coffee cake is a double-layered cinnamon and cream cheese delight. Craving more of your meal? You're in luck: certain menu items, denoted with an asterisk, are available for purchase up front.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60657-Southport_Grocery-273489-41102

Counter service moves quickly at this affordable and popular Diversey Avenue taqueria, as staffers smoothly satiate customers with a concise but tasty array of tortas, tacos, and burritos wrapped in handmade tortillas. The interior décor is just as colorful as the outside, with pulsing Latin music to keep you moving as you munch. Ultra-fresh dishes are cooked to order, like a grilled burrito stuffed with charred poblanos, caramelized onion, and tomatillo-jalapeño salsa. Carne asada tacos arrive packed with grilled, well-seasoned beef; while crisp tortilla chips, still warm from the fryer, are addictive companions for scooping chunky, garlicky guacamole.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60647-L_Patron-409362-41102

Good standard.","Hiding in plain sight on a residential Logan Square block, Jam remains the sweetheart of brunch-o-philes who won't settle for some greasy spoon. Clean white walls and gray stone tables punctuated by lime green placemats give a gallery-like feel to the space; a friendly welcome and wide-open kitchen keep it homey. Their brunch standards like French toast are nothing short of luxurious: think brioche soaked in vanilla- and malt-spiked custard cooked sous vide to absorb every drop, then caramelized in a sizzling pan and garnished with lime leaf-whipped cream and pineapple compote. Braised beef, tangy tomato crema, and smoked Gouda are rolled into lacy buckwheat crêpes and topped with a sunnyside egg for an elegant take on the breakfast burrito.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-_-Jam-373571-41102

No matter what's on the constantly evolving menu, the fresh, seasonal, and always original fare keeps the casual spot slammed with the creative denizens of Logan Square from morning to night. The mouthwatering fixings in Lula's Royale breakfast sandwich change with the seasons and might include thin slices of meaty, tender short rib, a sunny-side up farm egg, smoky cumin aïoli and bitter orange jam served alongside a salad of vinegary carrot, daikon, and cilantro.

Good standard.","Not familiar with the food of Macau? Not to worry-Fat Rice turns the uninitiated into believers nightly. A wooden pergola shelters hardy souls braving the infamous wait for a table. Bar seating around the open kitchen gives a bird's-eye view of the mélange of ingredients used in each dish, though servers are happy to walk any guest through the intoxicating mashup of Portuguese and Asian cuisine. Sharing is recommended for platters like the namesake arroz gordo, a paella-esque blend of meat, shellfish, and pickles. Pillowy bread sops up chunky olive-and-bacalhau spread in a pool of verdant olive oil. Shredded dried pork and fried shallots are intriguing but successful dessert components, when paired with salted caramel, sesame and crispy rice.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60647-Fat_Rice-408492-41102
245,Cochon Volant,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Though it's attached to the Hyatt, Cochon Volant is quickly entrenching itself as a favorite with Loop locals and sightseers alike for its timeless warmth. Round bistro tables and bentwood chairs are clustered across the mosaic-tiled floor, while a broad, marble-topped bar is bustling with patrons from lunch to happy hour. French brasserie favorites dominate the menu, ranging from rustic French onion soup to lavish raw seafood plateaus. Steak frites are juicy and flavorsome with a tender prime cut of bavette, offered with five sauce options like a classic béarnaise or rich Roquefort. Breakfast is delicious, but for those who don't have time to sit and stay a while, the café and takeaway bakery lets commuters snag a pastry and coffee to go.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60603-Cochon_Volant-471936-41102

Crimson-hued, faux-alligator chairs and banquettes punctuate a sprawling wood-paneled dining room, where tuxedoed servers weave expertly among suited bankers. A winding staircase leads to a lofty mezzanine. Classic cuts and chops abound, but Rosebud Prime does all of its dishes with panache. Double-cut bone-in lamb chops sport a plump ribbon of fat encircling their delicate, rich centers. Two strips of grilled skirt steak remain juicy and tender, complemented by a pile of caramelized Bermuda onions; and rich beef and veal ragù makes penne Bolognese a lovely surprise, finished with a dollop of fresh ricotta.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60603-Rosebud_Prime-281103-41102
247,Atwood,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This corner restaurant's 19th century façade may be historic, but its soaring dining room is a strikingly modern vision of white marble-topped tables, glossy beveled subway tiles, and low-slung black leather chairs and banquettes. The crimson bar stools fill with patrons meeting for business and pleasure all week, while brunch gets the place buzzing on weekends. Atwood's brasserie menu isn't exactly full of surprises, but its familiar foods are given first-class upgrades-think pancetta-studded mac and cheese; lamb chops with basil and preserved lemon; and an omelet with crunchy bacon, creamy Brie, and verdant asparagus. For a real wake-up call, the Inferno Virgin Mary has more than enough of a kick (plus more of that bacon as a garnish).",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60602-Atwood-268972-41102
248,Prime & Provisions,Cuisine Steakhouse,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"Though it would also feel at home in Las Vegas, this glitzy oversized steakhouse fits right in with its swanky Chicago riverfront neighbors. The polished, masculine interior makes its priorities clear from the get-go, showcasing a two-story wine tower and a peek into the dry-aging room under bold barrel-vaulted ceilings and chandeliers. A starter of chewy rosemary-sea salt monkey bread whets the palate, while rosy pink slices of slow-roasted bone-in prime rib, rubbed with a crust of fragrant herbs, take a classic hoagie to new heights. When paired with house-cut fries and creamy horseradish dip, it's a meal to rival a Porterhouse, but save room for dessert: a single-serving banana cream pie with loads of whipped cream is a whimsical final bite.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60601-Prime_Provisions-478764-41102

The restaurant's approachable, community-minded take on straightforward seasonal food-along with its impressive drinks program-makes it easy to please. Even if you're not attending a Monday ""Community Night"" dinner alongside many of the purveyors whose ingredients appear on the plate, you'll find a fresh, flavorful mix of dishes. Crushed white bean bruschetta is topped with a sprightly herb and frisée salad, which is in turn dressed with a blood orange vinaigrette.

The finely tailored locale bustles day and night, thanks to being wrapped in windows along the riverfront, sumptuous red leather furnishings, warm wood trim, and a crackerjack service team cementing its steakhouse vibe. Non-meat entrées include cedar-planked salmon with a sriracha-honey glaze, but make no mistake: beef is boss here. Prime steaks, butchered and dry-aged in-house for 35 days, get just the right amount of time under the flame, as is the case with the perfectly cooked-to-order Porterhouse-pre-sliced and plated for each guest. Sides are a must and should include the dome of hashbrowns, creamed spinach redolent of nutmeg, or tender stalks of grilled asparagus.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Chicago_Cut-333098-41102

The restaurant features an elevated roster of American classics including steaks, rotisserie chicken and seafood-not to mention a raw bar with Kansai-style box-pressed sushi.

A charcuterie board may offer up silky duck rillettes, shot through with foie gras; textured and spreadable liverwurst; as well as thin slices of prosciutto and coppa accompanied by a house-made mostarda.

Handsome banquettes and columns wrapped in celadon tiles lend a clubby allure, but the space's buzzy vibe never feels overwhelming. While a bar stretching half the length of the restaurant gets its fair share of happy-hour crowds, the rear dining rooms offer a more relaxed setting. Pub classics with flair define the menu, like malt-battered cod with creamy tartar sauce and parsley-dusted thick-cut fries-a solid rendition of fish and chips. Keep it light with crunchy watercress and sugar snap pea salad with house-made burrata, or go all out with a plate of chocolate-toffee cream puffs garnished with tender cocoa-dusted marshmallows.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60603-The_Gage-289587-41102

Polished black, white, and wood décor speaks to the finer things in life, with a menu of succulent steaks, raw bar offerings, and sides to back it up. For the best people-watching, score one of the semicircular booths edging the room. A massive single tiger prawn, served simply on ice with lemon, is a tasty, visually stunning starter. Steaks range from petite filets to dry-aged 24-ounce cowboy cuts with a list of big reds to match.

The dining room is striking with angular light fixtures and orange banquettes; a luminous marble bar and matching tables lend a masculine, sophisticated vibe. The carte's Italian standards are amped up to luxurious levels, like the Treviso and white bean salad with fennel, golden raisins, and crispy pancetta; or house-made duck egg spaghetti drenched in cream sauce and twirled around rapini, spicy pork sausage, and caramelized onions.

A mixture of funky décor elements-like cascading plants ""growing"" from filing cabinets on walls-somehow manage to work in incongruous harmony with sexy black marble and stainless steel throughout the multilevel space. Various bars offer pizza, crudo, fresh mozzarella, and house-made pasta, though even globally influenced dishes have a Mediterranean touch. The Tavern burger accompanied by parmesan-dusted fries is stacked with melted Taleggio, crispy speck, and garlic aïoli. Order the lush, creamy tiramisù for dessert, which gets a crunch from chopped nuts and crisp homemade meringues, and you'll be tempted to lick the bottom of the zinc tin.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Siena_Tavern-408501-41102

Our best addresses.,"Restaurateur Brendan Sokoloff (also of Maude's Liquor Bar and Au Cheval) breathes new life into the tried-and-true steakhouse concept with this swanky destination. The vibe inside may be dark and loud, but that only adds to the bonhomie of the chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures, and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas. Predictably, steakhouse and raw bar standards dominate the menu. Most steaks are wet-aged, and though some may prefer more funk, the cuts are expertly broiled. The kitchen deserves praise for unexpected options like creamy short rib stroganoff featuring hand-cut pasta; buttermilk fried chicken; and sides such as elote-style corn in a rich cheese sauce sparked with lime.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Bavette_s_Bar_Boeuf-399958-41102

Our best addresses.,"Every city needs a restaurant with the word ""club"" in the title-somewhere reassuringly old-school where you'd take your future father-in-law if you want to marry his daughter. Tortoise Club fits the bill perfectly. If it was just a few years older, it would be called an institution because it also harks back to more dissolute times; order a Negroni at lunchtime here and no one will bat an eyelid. The place has an unapologetically masculine look thanks to the mahogany paneling and dark leather seating. It has a lounge bar with nightly live jazz and a familiar menu of American classics, from big plates of seafood to great steaks. Where it differs from many similar spots is that here the service is sprightly and sincere and the welcome is warm.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Tortoise_Club-399964-41102

The bar up front mixes cocktails to a metronomic rhythm, while the back is more intimate with brick walls, studded leather banquettes, and nostalgic lighting. However make no mistake: this is no Bugsy Malone speakeasy, but a grown-up version for bar-flies with astute palates. Snack on creamy burrata and shaved ham finished with a swig of extra virgin olive oil before savoring tender, flavorful pork meatballs on a bed of wilted kale with romesco and almond gremolata.

260,Travelle,Cuisine Mediterranean,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"This contemporary Mediterranean dining room shares its home-a landmark Mies van der Rohe tower completed in 1972-with The Langham hotel. Floor-to-ceiling windows on the second floor space offer views of Marina City, but with its stunning kitchen displayed behind gradient glass panels, the scene inside is equally dramatic. Creative add-ins bring flair and flavor to flawlessly executed and gorgeously composed dishes. A perfect, toothsome champagne risotto is enlivened by juicy, barely pickled grapes and toasted Marcona almonds, while a thick, creamy tranche of seared salmon rests on ""healthy"" fried green farro, finished with a tangy drizzle of spicy soy-mustard. Raspberry coulis and meringue shards are an ideal garnish for a fresh and zesty citrus tart.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Travelle-410317-41102
261,C Chicago,Cuisine Seafood,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"This spacious looker lands in River North courtesy of the team behind the popular Chicago Cut Steakhouse. At C Chicago, the focus is on fresh-make that really fresh-seafood. This is exciting news: there aren't many seafood restaurants in Chicago, and the few that exist aren't doing it like the talented Chef Bill Montagne, who hails from the piscine temple, Le Bernardin. Kick things off with a beautiful scallop carpaccio kissed with olive oil, lemon juice, basil, chives and Espelette pepper. Then nibble on an irresistibly chewy farro salad, served warm, tossed with charred corn, mustard greens, and topped with whipped feta. The baked Aleutian cod, arriving in a perfectly subtle Basquaise sauce and dotted with squid ink and red wine vinaigrette is sublime.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-C_Chicago-478767-41102
262,Celeste,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Celeste celebrates the city's close relationship with that great American institution-the bar. It is a veritable fun palace evoking the great drinking establishments of the last century and is spread over three floors. On the first floor is a bar with an abbreviated menu. On the second floor is the narrow and nominally named Deco Room where the marble-topped tables face another bar; and upstairs is reserved for private parties. The food is certainly more than a mere addendum to the terrific cocktail list and the kitchen is clearly a skilled one. Dishes are quite elaborate in their construction-order lamb and you may find it includes the loin, belly and sweetbreads- and they are as flavorsome as they are attractive.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Celeste-448336-41102

Simple standard.","Both turtles and noodles symbolize longevity, so a meal at Slurping Turtle should add a few years to your life (and warmth to your belly). Inside the minimalist bento box of a space, diners sit elbow-to-elbow at sleek white communal tables. Boutique Japanese beverages like Hitachino Nest beer and Ramuné bubble-gum soda bring smiles to patrons in the know. Along with deep, steaming bowls of ramen and udon, the lengthy menu serves small plates, sushi, and other Japanese comfort food for snacking and sharing. Tender ribeye and chicken skewers arrive moist and glistening, straight from the binchotan charcoal grill. Deep-fried Brussels sprouts are crispy outside and tender inside without a hint of grease, topped with sliced scallions and fried shallots.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Slurping_Turtle-366460-41102
264,Paris Club,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Some of Paris Club was commandeered to create a ramen spot next door, but in return for this munificence, it got a first-rate makeover. Dressed in red leather seats, wood panelling and globe lighting, it perfectly captures the look of a traditional Parisian brasserie. The only thing missing is insouciant service and someone with a dog on their lap. The menu is unapologetically Gallic, ""Le Prime Steakburger"" notwithstanding, and all the classics are present: from fruits de mer to steak frites and baba au rhum. The pommes purée is so wonderfully buttery you'll need a defibrillator on standby. The wine list is all French too.

The menu at this Asian concept revolves around a handful of tastefully crafted broths dancing with thin, wavy noodles produced by Sun Noodle. The tonkotsu ramen is a traditional pleasure afloat with sweet slices of chashu, wakame, and molten egg. Meanwhile, the smoked brisket ramen is a novel departure defined by a black garlic-enriched chicken broth and slices of Bub City's 18-hour brisket. Ramen-san's loyal following is comprised of hipsters and suits alike, and they all seem to dig the salvaged look and booming playlist.

Excellent standard. Our best addresses.","This bold setting puts the Chicago River, Tribune and Wrigley buildings at your fingertips from the sixteenth floor of the Trump Hotel. The lobby entrance is as unremarkable as the dining room is dramatic, centered around an enormous Swarovski chandelier that hangs like an inverted wedding cake over a curving wall of African rosewood. Beyond this lies a kitchen that takes itself very seriously, but that's ok. Chef Thomas Lents' cuisine is extraordinary, accomplished, and even more of a draw than the décor. Meals here are very conceptual and include head-spinning affairs that articulate a theme, like the ""Faces of Sixteen"" as an homage to inspirations and employees. This may translate as a tribute to Joël Robuchon through a pot of wonderfully smooth, raw and seasoned langoustine artfully topped with gelée and sea buckthorn. Another theme ""Food in Progress, Modern Fine Dining: Moving Forward with Respect to the Past"" ponders the emergence of the Nordic through a gently smoked oyster, flavorful potato gelée, horseradish, and caraway. Grilled lobster with uni, coffee, and rice is downright unforgettable.

Brass-clad globe lights glow above lacquered plank tables in the front bar room, leading to tufted leather couches and fireplaces in the book-lined and Hogwarts-worthy library. The second floor is low-slung and loungy. A wall-sized chalkboard behind the marble bar whets whistles with descriptions of house cocktails. Shareable farm-to-table dishes appeal to nearly every appetite. Kale salad, that ubiquitous menu staple, gets a new twist when tossed with pickled blackberries, candied walnuts, and grated ricotta salata. And, a quartet of juicy, beautifully cooked lamb chops over rustic chickpea purée is brightened by a handful of chopped olives and mint.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60640-Hubbard_Inn-333099-41102
268,Bub City,Cuisine Barbecue,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Bub City isn't as far south as Nashville or Memphis, but the country music vibe comes through just the same at this barbecue- and booze-focused hang. Two bars flank the main stage that hosts nightly live entertainment. One bar is a shrine to over 100 varieties of whiskey, and the other to beer-easily identified by the American flag made from empty cans stacked behind its counter. Along with the extensive lineup of traditional smoked brisket, ribs, and fried chicken, a raw bar brings chilled seafood refreshment before spicy cheese-stuffed Texas Torpedoes and loaded hot link sandwiches. A bowl of Smokie's chili arrives with a kick from sliced jalapeño, but the caddy of barbecue and hot sauces on each table lets heat fiends intensify the seasoning.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Bub_City-399959-41102

Very good standard. Our best addresses.","Summit the historic Chicago Stock Exchange building via a private elevator to reach the sophisticated-though not outdated-scene at Everest on the 40th floor. The sunken-level dining room stays dimly lit by contemporary circular metal light fixtures, all the better to gaze admiringly at the views from the windows framing the formal space. Heavy white linens and abstract bronze sculptures adorn each table, at which smartly-dressed guests take it all in. Alsatian chef Jean Joho keeps to the French tradition on his degustation and prix-fixe menus, with nods to local ingredients among the classical techniques and pairings presented nightly. Where other chefs may feel the need to update and tweak time-honored dishes, Everest celebrates its classics. Subtle hints of ginger in a rich Gewürztraminer butter sauce complement succulent chunks of fresh Maine lobster. Two thick, bone-in lamb chops, ringed elegantly with flavorful fat, are tender but never too chewy, their richness amplified by delicate, silken spring garlic flan and a bed of crisp green beans that soak up the thyme jus.

The narrow room is dominated by a 40-foot bar which morphs into an open kitchen. The lights are turned down and the music is turned up-and unless they know Big Audio Dynamite, it's not music for kids. When it comes to the food, ""locally sourced and globally inspired"" is their USP with the chef, a Four Seasons alumnus, making much of his largely European peregrinations. Expect punchy flavors, teasing combinations, clever twists, and everything from salumi and tuna crudo in a jar to ""popcorn"" sweetbreads, pastas, and Moroccan stews. The terrific cocktail and drinks list covers all bases too. And who isn't tempted to take dessert in liquid form?",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Bottlefork-448335-41102

While it may share an entrance and bar with sibling, Frontera Grill, that is where the likeness ends. Walk past a sliding door to enter this elegant, terra cotta-lined dining room, which feels worlds away from the fiesta upfront. Lunch is notably laid-back, but chatty, over-eager servers turn dinner into a more exhaustive experience. Enduring their descriptive chalk talk may feel a bit like sitting through a college lecture for some, but be patient as you will be rewarded with exceptional food boasting a panoply of flavors, colors, and textures. A trio of ceviches highlighting albacore, tomato, and olive; Yucatecan shrimp and calamari; and tuna coctel make for divine starters. And, the sopa seca de fideos, tossed in a saucy tomato-morita broth and fortified by chorizo, crema, and Brussels sprouts, is perhaps the best in the country. Desserts are flagrantly inventive and the strongest element of this epicurean show. A torta de elote or warm corn cake with golden corn ice cream, cherry preserves, and salty caramel corn is absolutey fantastic.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Topolobampo-269297-41102

Navy velvet curtains that hang in the wide, welcoming, high-ceilinged room may dampen the din, but not the enthusiasm from regulars ready for a delicious mid-day tavolata and bottle from the all-Italian wine list. Business types fill every seat for the piatti unici, a chef-chosen lunch special that changes daily but is always made with expert care. Selections may include Rushing Rivers trout over lentils and spinach paired with speck- and mushroom-studded risotto made with Carnaroli rice.

The service at this dining room, psychedelic in its color scheme, can verge on vapid, but find a seat on the bar side for a warmer (and worthier) experience. The ever-changing menu is cohesive with a mix of classics and specialties like sopa azteca, a nourishing pasilla chile broth poured atop crisp tortilla strips, cool avocado, grilled chicken, and jack cheese. A version of the classic from Morelia, enchiladas a la plaza are first flash-fried, then folded over seasoned cabbage, potatoes, and carrots.

The affordable lunch menu features dishes like carrot salad with shaved country ham, an assertively spicy togarashi dressing, and a swipe of yuzu curd; or udon in a thickened broth with diced tofu and seasonal vegetables.

Muted tones in the exposed brick walls and custom tile flooring complement newer elements like floor-to-ceiling wine storage and dramatic smoke-shaded chandeliers that drip with crystals. Though the décor may tip its hat to yesteryear, Chef Andrew Zimmerman's cuisine is firmly grounded in the 21st century. Whether you visit for lunch or dinner, meals here always seem to reflect the amalgam of American cuisine, with hints of Southeast Asian, Korean, and Mediterranean tastes. Potato gnocchi may seem commonplace, but this version is memorable thanks to the flawless components and rich, profound flavors of lamb sugo with crunchy bits of ciabatta breadcrumbs. Chicken here is downright exciting, served tender and crisp-skinned with a supremely buttery Albufera sauce, crumbly chestnuts, caramelized fennel, and sausage.

For a front row seat of the action, sit at the surrounding counter topped with charred shou-sugi-ban wood. With such a prominent display, guests would be remiss not to try choices from the robata. Lightly blackened lamb chops in a sweet-and-spicy glaze are tender, smoky, and ready for dipping in crimson Korean chili sauce.

Two expansive menus-one vegetarian, the other carnivorous-encompass Indian-inspired tapas and street foods. If feeling overhelmed by the choices, stick to the chef's specialties or go for the prix-fixe and let the kitchen decide. Meaty delicacies include spice-rubbed Mysore lamb chops with pink pickled onions. Gobi Portuguese lets tart tomatillo chutney and crunchy eggplant offset sweet coconut gravy and tender cauliflower.

For dessert, order the manzana to receive a miniature apple cake dressed with rosemary crumble, cider reduction, and goat cheese ice cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60661-Salero-474211-41102
291,Sable Kitchen & Bar,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Tucked into the spacious and beautiful Hotel Palomar, Sable Kitchen & Bar is a sleek, sultry, and sophisticated number, fitted out with different dining areas. There's the stunning 40-foot bar, tricked out in gorgeous dark paneling, soft leather seats, and unique light fixtures. The expansive dining room is equally elegant and urbane, attracting dates looking for more intimacy or friends catching up over dinner.The chef manning the ship here is Lawrence Letrero, and an evening in his very capable hands might entail a decadently spicy and wonderfully complex starter of shrimp and roasted squash curry. Then diners may graduate to crispy, juicy adobo pork belly, served with sticky rice, and a pickled green papaya salad topped with a fried farm egg.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Sable_Kitchen_Bar-289590-41102
292,GT Fish & Oyster,Cuisine Seafood,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","Quaint seaside shacks have nothing on this urban spot that exudes nautical chic. A boomerang-shaped communal table by the raw bar makes a perfect oyster-slurping perch. Lead fishing weights keep napkins in place on nautically styled, brass-edged tables, lined up under an enormous chalkboard-style mural of a jaunty swordfish skeleton. Pescatarians savor the numerous seafood dishes meant for sharing, but those who forego fish are limited to three meat options. Rectangular crab cakes, stuffed to the gills with sweet meat, get a crunchy sear on all sides. Salade Niçoise spotlights pristine slices of fresh tuna and snappy green beans in a cider-mustard dressing. Key lime pie, a traditional meal-ender, is transformed into light layers of curd and cake in a glass jar.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-GT_Fish_Oyster-337554-41102
293,Brindille,Cuisine French,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Very good standard.,"This posh bistro is located just steps away from NAHA, it's impressive sister restaurant from cousins Carrie and Michael Nahabedian. Hushed and intimate, the dining room is awash with a palette of soothing greys and dressed up with herringbone floors along with black-and-white photography. Brindille's menu isn't a sequel to NAHA's contemporary Mediterranean fare, but instead bears a strong Parisian accent influenced by the chef's love of French cuisine. Roasted chestnuts are whirled into a creamy soup and poured over compressed apple, wild mushrooms, and puffed rice. Spot-on Dover sole meuniere is plated with a purée of watercress and golden-crisp pommes rissolées. And for dessert, preserved cherries are just one option to fill the baked-to-order almond clafoutis.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Brindille-408500-41102
294,Lou Mitchell's,Cuisine American,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"At the top of Chicago's list of beloved names is Lou Mitchell. This eponymous diner is by no means an elegant affair, but thanks to its delicious omelets and iconic crowd, it has been on the Windy City's must-eat list since 1923. Don't panic at the length of the lines: they are long but move fast, and free doughnut holes (one of the restaurant's signature baked goods) make the wait go faster. Back to those omelets: they may be made with mere eggs, like everyone else's, but somehow these are lighter and fluffier, almost like a soufflé, stuffed with feta, spinach, onions, or any other ingredients of your choice. They arrive in skillets with an Idaho-sized helping of potatoes. The best part? Everyone gets a swirl of soft-serve at the meal's end.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60661-Lou_Mitchell_s-273460-41102
295,Grace,Cuisine Contemporary,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"Three MICHELIN stars: unique cuisine. Worth a special trip! 





Excellent standard. Our best addresses.","Ask a passing foodie to name one of Chicago's most elegant and sophisticated restaurants and they'll probably say Grace. This room is as handsome as it is urbane and provides a supremely comfortable environment for those spending an evening discovering the culinary wizardry of Curtis Duffy. You'll be presented with a choice between two seasonally changing menus: ""Fauna"" or, for vegetarians, ""Flora."" Opt for the wine pairings and you're done on the decision making for the night. Trying to keep track of the ingredients of each dish will nullify the benefit of the wine, so instead just marvel at the clever presentation and dig in-because taste is what this food is all about. The dishes are intricate and elaborately constructed, with herbs playing an integral part rather than merely being a garnish. Occasionally your taste buds will get a little slap, perhaps with the odd Thai or Vietnamese flavor, and the courses will fly by. This style of cooking is very labor-intensive and if you want to learn more, then take advantage of their offer of a post-prandial kitchen tour.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60661-Grace-399967-41102
296,Baffo,Cuisine Italian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"As the flagship fine dining experience of Eataly's mega food mecca, Baffo brings the Mario Batali brand of contemporary Italian cuisine to downtown Chicago. Dim lighting and stylized black-and-white accents add drama to the formal white-tablecloth space, which strives for sophistication despite stutter-start service that needs a bit more fine tuning to shine like a true Batali star. Thanks to truly top-notch ingredients, simple dishes like poached veal tongue with spicy giardiniera and caramelized onions stand out on the menu. Though pastas can verge on the edge of too al dente, braised short rib is perfectly fork-tender with a crunchy, buttery breadcrumb topping and rustic braised greens primed for soaking up the meat's rich jus.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Baffo-436452-41102

Simple standard.","This Windy City haunt is so popular that the patio provides valuable real estate all year long by way of screens and heat lamps. If you are able to score a seat inside, where tightly packed tables bolster the accommodations, you'll enjoy a view of the kitchen from the Carrara marble bar. The extensive small plates menu is primed for pairing with the wine list, and unusual cuts of meat-like a panini with pork heart-take precedence. Inspired by a Chicago beef, this ciabatta roll is moistened with jus, stuffed full of pork, and dressed with sweet peppers and spicy-tangy giardiniera. A plethora of charcuterie, fried bites, and spreads like whipped feta with cucumbers guarantees all who sip and sup here leave with a full belly and wine-stained mouth.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-The_Purple_Pig-281101-41102

Leather and velvet accents telegraph an upscale vibe, and references to His Airness are subtle-from oversized sepia photographs of basketball netting to a 23-layer chocolate cake for dessert. A glass of Amarone with a dry-aged Porterhouse is always a slam-dunk, but the kitchen also turns out pleasing modern twists on steakhouse classics. Chicago's famous Italian beef gets an upgrade with smoked ribeye and aged provolone. Similarly, the traditional wedge salad is presented as a halved small head of baby romaine, layered here with creamy Wisconsin blue cheese and thick slabs of crispy bacon.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Michael_Jordan_s-362547-41102
299,Joe's,Cuisine American,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Very good standard.,"Despite the ample neighborhood competition, this outpost of the original Miami seafood, steak, and stone crab palace does just fine up north. Clubby, masculine décor fashions a classic scene, while business diners and lively martini-toasting groups keep the leather booths full from lunch through dinner. Stone crab claws accompanied by signature mustard sauce are shared by nearly every table, followed by decadent dishes like a bone-in filet with their simple yet delicious coriander-spiked seasoning. Americana sides like Jennie's fontina and asiago mashed potatoes, or grilled tomatoes topped with cheesy spinach pesto, are ample enough to share. Joe's Key lime pie is rightly famous, but other retro sweets like coconut cream pie are worth a forkful.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Joe_s-289589-41102
300,Labriola,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Supersizing his popular Oak Brook café, baker Rich Labriola expands his eponymous empire just off Michigan Avenue. The hangar-sized space is three operations in one: a café for pastries and casual bites; a bar; and a full-scale restaurant. Though the décor takes cues from French brasseries, the menus have a decidedly Italian focus. No matter where you're seated, you can sample the quality imported salumi and formaggio selections like Parma ham and Granduca pecorino, accompanied by charred bread and sharp chutney. Neopolitan pizzas, fritto misto, and house-made pastas like bucatini all'Amatriciana don't disappoint, and tiramisù gets a new twist in a mélange of velvety smooth chocolate mousse, espresso-infused mascarpone, and coffee-soaked cake cubes.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Labriola-471940-41102

Rawhide tablecloths and masculine wood-and-rope décor elements hint at the ranch and open range, though the cocktails and young, trendy clientele at the accompanying bar are strictly urban. The all-American menu offers a wide selection of top-notch beef and hearty sides to match. Skewered cubes of maple syrup-smothered, black pepper-dusted bacon are a playful snack to share, a poppable prelude to the carnivorous courses to follow. Bone-in steaks like the 8-ounce filet are juicy and flavor-packed; many cuts are aged in-house in a Himalayan salt-tiled room for prime attention and coddling.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-David_Burke_s_Primehouse-268989-41102
302,Union Sushi + Barbeque Bar,Cuisine Japanese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"The slogan of this big, bustling restaurant is ""Uniting Japanese culinary tradition with a distinctly American persona,"" which roughly translates to ""Japanese food with a party hat on."" The cocktails are good, the noise levels are high, and there are more tattoos in the room than a Yakuza convention. The menu will take forever to read so just go directly to their two specialties-the assorted sushi rolls, some of which use black rice, and meats and fish expertly cooked over an open flame on the seriously hot robata. The ingredients are good and the flavor combinations don't get silly. Just remember that sharing is the key to keeping that final check in check, especially as the T-shirted staff are masters of upselling with an iPad.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Union_Sushi_Barbeque_Bar-340603-41102

To start, make like the cool kids and order something from the well-stocked bar: Moscow Mules are presented properly in frosty copper mugs, killer Bloody Marys are fortified by skewers of huge olives and blocks of dill Havarti, and the beer list boasts there's ""no crap on tap"". Paramount's menu features dishes that make the most of top-quality ingredients, like a plump burger crafted from 100 percent Wagyu beef on a toasted brioche bun. Daily specials have featured a trio of sweet and zesty pulled pork sliders sided by a heap of crisp and crunchy tempura-style green beans.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-Paramount_Room-269224-41102

The dining room's tightly packed tables are perfect for grazing, and soaring ceilings along with cathedral windows overlooking Grant Park impress locals and out-of-towners alike. Plump, crunchy gambas al ajillo are bathed in buttery garlic sauce with a hint of lemon, and servers add to the excitement by drizzling jus over skewers of bacon-wrapped lamb loin medallions at the table. This is the kind of place where nary a splash of sauce is left behind, so use those slices of brioche-with a swipe of sweet onion purée for good measure-to sop up every last delicious drop.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60605-Mercat_a_la_Planxa-269221-41102

Simple standard.","This corner bar on Randolph Street's restaurant row may be dim, but it's got a few glittering edges. The reel-to-reel in the doorway lends a retro feel, but the rest is decidedly cushy. Late-night revelers prefer to sit at tufted leather booths or savor beers at the zinc-topped bar, rather than endure a wait for a table in the raucous space. Bartenders work just as hard as line cooks until the wee hours. The kitchen puts a highfalutin spin on simple bar eats. In-house butchers craft 32-ounce pork Porterhouses for sharing; foie gras for folding into fluffy scrambled eggs; and house-made sausages for bologna sandwiches that go well beyond a kid's wildest dreams. Thin griddled cheeseburger patties are perked up by maple syrup-glazed peppered bacon.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Au_Cheval-366461-41102

Surrounded by backlit bottles of top-notch spirits under wrought-iron latticework light panels, guests gather for convivial conversation and great drinks. Fans of Bourbon will delight in the Derby Day Mule, which swaps out vodka for Buffalo Trace. Pair your libation with rib-sticking dishes like a sandwich of garlic- and balsamic vinegar-roasted portobello mushroom caps layered with a runny egg, grilled tomato, and blue cheese; or a steaming bowl of braised duck soup complete with thick and silky pappardelle. End on a high note-think Bourbon-infused milkshake with house-made ice cream, natch.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-The_Franklin_Room-474205-41102

Comfy leather banquettes and wide wooden tables are well spaced throughout the bi-level restaurant, offering a respite for shoppers to relax with a cheese plate and craft beer flight. Share an order of prime rib poutine among friends-it's drenched in beef gravy and pepper jack cheese-or go whole hog with the prime rib sandwich, which is hand-carved to order and presented tableside with horseradish cream and au jus. For something lighter but just as pleasurable, try the kale Caesar, with white anchovies and a delicately creamy garlic dressing.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Side_Door-474208-41102

A pick-your-own-protein adventure, the menu is organized by ingredient with a dedicated section for goat. Paper-thin goat carpaccio is dusted with fried capers, beads of smoked trout roe, and an olive-maple vinaigrette.

Two rooms, each equipped with a bar, make it easy to get started with a strawberry-mint margarita or Mexican beer. Don't let the name change fool you; ¡Hello Tacos! is still everything you've come to love about De Cero over the years. Tacos are made with hand-pressed corn tortillas and ordered individually, letting diners sample a range of fillings including rich duck confit and spicy corn salsa.

In addition to excellent cuts of beef, Rural Society grills up stellar Maine lobster, chicken, and chops, while the oven produces mouthwatering Argentinean pizzas and homemade-spiced sausages. Be sure to try the plana di hierro and fritas, a South American version of traditional steak frites that boasts a subtly smoky flavor and a creamy, chili-spiced butter dip for those crispy chips.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Rural_Society-471941-41102

The self-described ""modern Midwestern"" menu pulls influences and ingredients from around the globe, yet maintains a distinctly American feel in dishes like cotton cake-an airy Japanese-style cheesecake kept light with streaks of persimmon jam and basil streusel.

Sit at the counter to best appreciate their specialty-the Japanese art of grilling. For a good value lunch look no further than the bento boxes, but come at night and you'll be able to try a variety of grilled items where the natural flavors shine through, whether that's Wagyu beef or crab. You can also try more unusual cuts that you may hitherto have avoided, such as chicken heart or tail. The service is smiley, helpful, and sincere.

Among the terrific selection, enjoy the likes of hamachi sporting a spicy mix of shredded Napa cabbage, daikon, and red chili; or salmon dressed with a sweet ginger-soy sauce and fried ginger chips. South Pacific sea bream is deliciously embellished with a drizzle of smoky tomato and black sea salt.

Salads are crisp and refreshing, pan-seared cheese is flambéed tableside, and the fresh seafood doesn't disappoint: fish are grilled whole, filleted, and dressed simply with herbs, a few glugs of olive oil, and squeeze of lemon.

More worthy of attention, however, is High Five Ramen, a downstairs nook where the queue for one of its 16-seats starts early. Once inside, slurp a bowl of the signature, crazy-spicy broth. Loaded with thin alkaline noodles, a slow-cooked egg, roasted pork belly, locally grown sprouts, and black garlic oil, this unique rendition is worth the burn.

Vases of dried lavender evoke scents of the Mediterranean, as do the kitchen's creations, which feature homemade ravioli filled with favas, a poached egg, and parmesan broth.

Good standard.","Don't be fooled by the aged patina of this sexy boîte: though a few items like the overstuffed curio cabinet and salvaged French metal chairs are true antiques, this chicly disheveled hang has been hiding out on West Randolph for only a few years. Contemporary and classic cocktails like a violet-tinged Aviator are served in champagne coupes, adding to the vintage atmosphere. Head to the second-floor bar to snack on oysters and frites, or fill up on Francophile comfort food under the glow of mismatched crystal chandeliers. Juicy, garlicky Toulouse-style pork sausage is served whole over bacon-stewed lentils, and smashed potatoes are rich with chicken jus. Sugar fiends will delight in the crème brûlée, which sports the perfect crackling sugar veneer.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Maude_s_Liquor_Bar-339787-41102
324,graham elliot Bistro,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"It's not likely you'll see peripatetic MasterChef Graham Elliot working the line at this bistro any time soon, but his namesake retains the pizzazz it brought years ago as a newcomer to the West Loop. Dramatic backlighting, colorful mosaics, and modern stained glass brighten the narrow, high-ceilinged space. The kitchen hums along in time to music bouncing off polished concrete floors. Simple comfort food goes upscale with the kitchen's cleverly deconstructed dishes. A breakfast-for-dinner twist on salmon becomes a perfectly seared fillet atop a dilled cream cheese ""schmear;"" an everything bagel tuile and onion jam drive the point home. Chicken noodle soup becomes pillowy mousseline-filled agnolotti on a bed of sunchoke purée and roasted carrots.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-_-graham_elliot_Bistro-373581-41102
325,Grange Hall Burger Bar,Cuisine American,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"American Gothic accents (think Grant Wood) invade the big city at Grange Hall, where a down-on-the-farm vibe is telegraphed loud and clear through swinging barn doors, quilted panels hanging above the lunch counter, and mismatched knit napkins set atop tables with wooden chairs and stools. The glassed-in pie kitchen in the back hints dessert won't be an afterthought. Choose your own adventure when building a burger, starting with a six- or nine-ounce grass-fed beef patty and adding toppings like Midwestern cheeses, smoked bacon, jalapeños, or homemade pickles. If a wedge of strawberry rhubarb pie or Bourbon-spiked milkshake is calling your name (especially when freshly churned ice cream is involved), go easy on those hand-cut farmhouse chili fries.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Grange_Hall_Burger_Bar-369071-41102

Good standard.","Business execs expecting the ubiquitous lunch buffet will be sorely disappointed by Jaipur-that is until they realize this popular weekday spot serves an affordable full-service lunch special that brings the buffet to your table in a parade of hammered copper katoris. In the evening, locals fill every sleek, nail-studded chair in the refined dining room as they await plates of boldly flavored Indian cooking. The broad menu features a lengthy selection of fresh and authentically treated favorites, most of which are available as part of the bountiful lunch special. Staples on the vast à la carte menu may include aloo papdi chaat; a rich and creamy chicken korma; spiced carrot soup; and scarlet-red tandoori chicken, served with garlic naan.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Jaipur-281122-41102
327,The Publican,Cuisine Gastropub,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard. Our best addresses.","The phrase ""meat market"" has many connotations at The Publican: everything about this bustling Fulton Market spot is communal, from the sprawling U-shaped table that dominates the space and the penned-in booths lining the perimeter to the sink outside the washrooms. That said, the ubiquitous pig-centric décor gives a more straightforward idea of what you'll find on the menu. As expected, pork takes precedence here with rillettes, platters of paper-thin aged ham slices, and house-made blood sausage to pair with one of the superlative beer selections. Weekend brunch gets in on the game with thickly sliced Publican bacon basted with Burton's maple syrup, or savory mushroom-and-chard French toast topped with roasted tomato and a fried egg.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-The_Publican-273498-41102
328,Les Nomades,Cuisine French,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Very good standard.,"A giddy excitement bubbles through the air at Les Nomades, and with good reason: this intimate, charming restaurant feels like a secret hideaway within a gated Streeterville brownstone. Owner Mary Beth Liccioni welcomes all as if they were old friends, seating guests among the graciously arranged fresh flowers, framed artwork, and linen-topped tables. Though the fragrant herb-loaded lavash presented at each table is good enough to make an entire meal out of, save room for entrées like grilled Scottish salmon, served medium-rare with a colorful, flavorful mélange of beets, cucumber, and black olive tapenade. A single translucent langoustine raviolo duets on a plate with tempura soft shell crab, both enhanced by harissa- and saffron-spiked rouille.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Les_Nomades-269216-41102
329,Chicago Curry House,Cuisine Indian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Good standard.,"Maybe you sniff the wafting aromas of ginger, garlic, and cumin first; maybe you hear the sitar music tinkling its welcoming notes as you enter. Either way, you know immediately that Chicago Curry House is a commendable showcase of Indian and Nepalese cuisine. The lunch buffet lets you eat your fill for under $12, with crispy pappadum, baskets of fresh naan, and must-have curries like the Nepalese khasi ko maasu with chunks of bone-in stewed goat in a velvety cardamom- and black pepper-sauce. Indian butter chicken, creamy and rich in a tomato- and garam masala-spiced stew, is equally sumptuous. À la carte offerings are even more extensive. The staff has helpful suggestions for dealing with the area's draconian parking restrictions, so call ahead for tips.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60605-Chicago_Curry_House-326620-41102
330,Indian Garden,Cuisine Indian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Frequent diners know it as ""The IG,"" but first-timers will appreciate the copious lunch buffet as much as the doctors, med students, and locals. These faithful droves routinely make the trip up a few flights of stairs to get their pakora and tandoori fix on, among kitschy but ornate touches like richly colored fabrics and wafting incense. Though the à la carte menu offers Northern Indian dishes brought to the table in shiny copper vessels, the lunch buffet covers all bases with vegetarian, chicken, and lamb items. Staples like saag, dal, naan, and basmati rice are freshly made. Bhuna gosht mixes succulent lamb with tomatoes, onions, and spices; while lassi or masala tea provide refreshment along with a decent selection of wine, beer, and cocktails.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Indian_Garden-273451-41102
331,Tru,Cuisine Contemporary,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Excellent standard.","Fine dining at Tru has a strong air of formality that extends from the service team to the moneyed, well-dressed clientele. Beyond the discreet exterior, find an intimate lounge with a spotlit and vivid blue sculpture. Decorative branches and net curtains divide the cavernous space; while white walls adorned with Warhol lithographs lend a luxe-gallery feel. Leather and velvet banquettes surrounding well-spaced tables are popular for quiet gatherings or romantic interludes. The variety of dining options begins with an excellent prix-fixe, extending all the way up to a deep-pocketed caviar selection. However, the menu fulfills its literal promise of exploring Chef Anthony Martin's very modern kitchen. Superlative talent is abundantly clear in the smooth and silky foie gras covered in a thin shell of sugar and counterbalanced by segments of blood orange. Succulent and pearly white halibut is seared to perfection and seasoned with a warm, chive-infused cream sauce, while Berkshire pork is the center of an impeccable presentation of ""petit vegetables"" including brilliantly crisp and tender peas. Solid desserts include an apple strudel filled with golden currants and flanked by an icy scoop of pear sorbet.

332,Brasserie by LM,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Taking its cue from the neighborhood cafés that dot the boulevards of Paris, Brasserie by LM brings a bit of stylish French spirit to Michigan Avenue. Despite its chi-chi surroundings at the Essex Inn across from Grant Park, this is an understated modern diner, serving up affordably priced bistro fare from morning to night. The croque monsieur is a totem of indulgence, layered with ham and béchamel, then lavishly buttered for grilling and blanketed with melted cheese. Skin-on pommes frites pair pleasantly with the sandwich, but grilled Caesar salad drizzled with a garlicky dressing is slightly more inculpable. Splurge on the signature teurgoule, a classic rice pudding from Normandy made with plump, toothsome grains and heaps of cinnamon.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60605-Brasserie_by_LM-373419-41102
333,Farmhouse,Cuisine Gastropub,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Like shaking the hand of your local farmer, grab the pitchfork door handles of Farmhouse and you'll be almost as close to the source of your food. Much of the décor is salvaged and much of the menu is procured right from the Midwest. From Indiana chicken to Michigan wine, local is more than a buzzword. Exposed brick, rough-hewn wood, and wire-encased filament bulbs make it the quintessential modern tavern. Highlights of the harvest headline each course. Whole-grain mustard dresses up a vibrant (and requisite) beet salad. Nueske's bacon is the star in a rustic BLT, accompanied by Klug Farms peaches tossed with balsamic dressing. Cream cheese-frosted carrot bread pudding is fragrant from autumn spices, layered with a golden raisin purée and nutmeg crunch.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-_-Farmhouse-373579-41102
334,Giordano's,Cuisine Pizza,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"Value, friendly service, and delicious deep-dish pizza make Giordano's a crowd sweetheart. With several locations dotting the city and suburbs, this restaurant has been gratifying locals with comforting Italian-American fare for years. Come during the week-service picks up especially at dinner-to avoid the cacophony. Giordano's menu includes your typical salads, pastas, et al., but you'd do well to save room for the real star: the deep-dish. Bring backup because this pie could feed a small country. The spinach version arrives on a buttery pastry crust, filled with spreads of sautéed (or steamed) spinach with tomato sauce, and topped with mozzarella and parmesan. For those cold, windy nights, opt for delivery-their website sketches a detailed menu.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Giordano_s-298865-41102

Good standard.","""See and be seen"" should be the motto of this hip spot, where globe lights shine like beacons through the façade's towering windows. Inside, a wraparound bar attracts spirited guests like moths to a flame. A lengthy communal table and open kitchen with a chef's counter offer multiple opportunities for meeting, greeting, and eating. Cocktails like the Surfer Rosa, which balances tequila and mezcal with blood orange and chilies, loosen-up diners jonesing for big flavors. When hunger strikes, caramelized onion sabayon, potato confit, and garlicky pea shoots add depth to an Arctic char fillet. And lest you forget dessert, Bourbon-pecan bread pudding set upon flash-frozen vanilla cream and drizzled with sea salt-butterscotch sauce, is meant for sharing-or not.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60654-The_Dawson-436448-41102
336,The Lobby,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"You can't say you weren't warned. The Peninsula people sensibly realized that honesty was best when naming this vast space which looks remarkably like...a lobby. At least the friendly staff manages to wrestle back some control, and you know your conversation won't be overheard-because there aren't any tables near you. So why the recommendation? Because the food is very good. The lunch menu doesn't really get past lobster rolls and chicken legs, but at night the kitchen's innate skill is very much in evidence. Dishes are good-looking, but also have depth and ingredients are of irreproachable quality. Flavors marry well and there are intriguing touches of originality but never at the expense of the overall balance of the dish.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-The_Lobby-399962-41102
337,Piccolo Sogno,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"In-the-know locals craving mouthwatering Italian fare head to this swanky spot, usually packed with a dressy crowd. Inside, they are welcomed by a palette of rich, cool hues, crystal-beaded light fixtures that hang overhead, and an open kitchen boasting a wood-burning oven. Piccolo Sogno's rustic, yet refined menu offers traditional dishes with a twist. A version of the ubiquitous beet salad (both red and golden) is elevated here by shaved fennel, a drizzle of bright citrus oil, and a dollop of creamy, lush buffalo milk ricotta. If you need further encouragement, let us recommend the rabbit. Braised in a white wine sauce redolent of rosemary and lemon, the tender meat is served with wilted escarole and porridge-like semolina pudding.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60642-Piccolo_Sogno-274770-41102
338,Fulton Market Kitchen,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard. Our best addresses.,"Floor-to-ceiling windows put Embeya's industrial interior on display, letting passersby soak up its intriguing sculptural elements and Asian-inspired decor. Inside, blown-glass bouquets of light fixtures hang above communal tables, and wooden screens in intricate cutout patterns divide the lofty, airy dining room and open kitchen, where Chef Mike Sheerin and his team whip up enticing Pan-Asian fare. The affordable lunch menu features dishes like carrot salad with shaved country ham, an assertively spicy togarashi dressing, and a swipe of yuzu curd; or udon in a thickened broth with diced tofu and seasonal vegetables. Dinner entrées display more ambition, as in poached halibut with coconut, hearts of palm, and mint fumet.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Fulton_Market_Kitchen-438107-41102
339,Gino's East,Cuisine Pizza,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Pizza pilgrims continue to make the trek to the original location of this renowned local deep-dish chain, where a 45 minute wait is the norm. However, solo diners may rest assured as they can order personal pies from a walk-up counter. The walls, scribbled with years of graffiti, are nearly as iconic as the high-walled pies themselves, whose crusts get their signature crunch from cornmeal and searing-hot metal pans rife with two inch-high sides. Filled with heaps of mozzarella and toppings like the ""Meaty Legend"" lineup of spicy pepperoni, Italian sausage, and both Canadian and regular bacon before getting sauced, it's hard to eat more than two wedges here. Nonconformists can of course opt for thin-crust pies, gussied-up by add-ons like roasted red peppers.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Gino_s_East-436454-41102
340,RL,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"If you swoon for tartan and pine for the posh life Ralph Lauren represents, head for the boîte attached to the flagship Michigan Avenue store. Like a stylish private club but without the centuries of stuffiness, RL offers options for a quick solo lunch, cocktail at the mahogany bar, or full dinner. The odd Blackhawks jersey here and there doesn't detract from the overall aura. The menu is as classically American as the name, featuring bistro favorites like Waldorf salad and raw bar offerings alongside well-prepared dishes like sweet and plump pan-seared scallops with white balsamic-crème fraîche. The thin, flaky crust of a goat cheese- and caramelized onion-tart nearly steals the show from the rich atmosphere of the wood-paneled dining room.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-RL-273486-41102
341,NoMI Kitchen,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"A hushed aerie awaits on the seventh floor of the Park Hyatt at NoMI Kitchen. Let the dapper staff whisk you through the hotel lobby and elevator to a glassed-in dining room with Water Tower views. A semi-open kitchen doesn't detract from the lush but restrained décor, and a breezy terrace offers an alfresco option with a different menu. Chef Ryan LaRoche's impressive, ingredient-driven dishes are equally inspired by Eastern and Western cuisines. Fresh fish makes for a seaworthy selection of sushi and maki, while pickled pepper jam and sweet pine nut streusel pair with orbs of fried caponata-style eggplant that are crispy on the outside and perfectly silky within. End with a parade of house-made ice cream flavors like toasted vanilla marshmallow.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-NoMI_Kitchen-273481-41102
342,La Sirena Clandestina,Cuisine Latin American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"A relaxing Caribbean vibe breezes its way northward to Fulton Market and settles within La Sirena Clandestina's aquamarine walls. Languidly spinning fans, light filtered through antique etched glass panels, and an international selection of sippable rum and mezcal all conspire to bring guests' blood pressure down a notch or two. Baked empanadas rotate through a series of fillings, but these popular pockets never leave the menu. Whether stuffed with venison ragù or ricotta, hazelnut, and butternut squash, they're all exceptional. Handfuls of Manchego add decadence to plump bomba rice studded with fiery pickled jalapeño rings, toasted pepitas, and buttery white corn. Classic alfajore shortbreads filled with dulce de leche and sea salt are a memorable send-off.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-La_Sirena_Clandestina-409369-41102
343,NEXT,Cuisine Contemporary,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Good standard.,"Welcome to dinner as theater, where the only thing more radical than each new theme is the success (or failure) of the cuisine. Next's conceit is reinvention. It may begin the year as, say, a culinary homage to French ""Bistro"" cooking with hit-or-miss fare that does little to underscore the kitchen's strengths. The long, dark, windowless room reflects that theme with a smattering of typical trappings, like chalkboard specials on the wall and little ceramic roosters on the table. Some concepts may be rooted in regional innovation, offering an array of Spanish ""Tapas."" Months later, the chefs may craft small plates with an eye on wine and global ""Terrior."" This is a very unique place with an adept and dexterous kitchen, but the experience just isn't for everyone.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-NEXT-410318-41102

Gleaming subway tiles play off retro leather booths and swiveling barstools, while jazz in the background keeps things moving with chutzpah and finesse. Diner standards include patty melts, sandwiches piled with corned beef or pastrami, knishes, and latkes. Bubbie's chicken soup comes bobbing with a fluffy matzo ball the size of a baseball; while Junior's cheesecake from Brooklyn or a triple-decker wedge of red velvet cake sates all the sweet-loving guests. A full-service deli counter offers salamis and smoked fish to-go. For a true blast from the past, stop by the candy stand near the entry stocked with Bazooka Joe and other favorites.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60605-Eleven_City_Diner-268991-41102
345,Bistronomic,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Tucked away from the buzz of the Magnificent Mile, Bistronomic is a great place to cool your tired heels. Jaunty red awnings beckon brightly, and the revolving door spins guests into a warm room that's focused on the bonhomie of dining with friends. Oxblood walls, gray banquettes, and a central bar play up the bistro feel, while the kitchen conveys creativity with fresh renditions of tasty classics. Rusticity and elegance come together in a fillet of Lake Superior whitefish that is pan-seared to golden-brown and matched with spring ratatouille, preserved lemon, and puréed eggplant. Exquisitely crisp feuilletine is a glamorous upgrade to the classic Kit Kat bar, folded with hazelnuts, bittersweet chocolate, and finished with a sweet-tart orange sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Bistronomic-333086-41102
346,La Sardine,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"In a neighborhood packed to the gills with gastronomic innovation, La Sardine may be the most daring option of all, flaunting hearty French bistro food in a warm and rustic setting. The time-tested combination of wheezing accordion music, white linens, tile floors, and pastoral murals makes it all the rage among diners craving the familiar-and a $30 lunch prix-fixe doesn't hurt either. From escargots and steak tartare to bouillabaisse and steak frites, Chef/owner Jean-Claude Poilevey nails the classic bistro dishes. Don't miss the steak haché, a patty of excellent ground beef seared to perfection, then topped with smoked goat cheese and plated with truffle-laced Bibb lettuce, a thick slice of maple bacon, and crunchy fried onion rings.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-La_Sardine-273457-41102
347,mk,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"After nearly two decades in business, larger than life ""mk"" still welcomes all to Chef/owner Michael Kornick's eponymous flagship. Rich brown tones warm up the former paint factory's lofty interior, which features a skylit space that's beloved citywide for big nights and romantic evenings. There's a seasonal dish here to sate every appetite, whether diners are seated at linen-draped tables or perched on sleek stools in the lounge area. Bar bites offer upscale indulgences like bison sliders tucked into bone marrow-buttered focaccia, while a dual preparation of tartares-yellowfin tuna with Moroccan olives complementing Scottish salmon with charred red onion-could be a meal on its own. For dessert, citrusy ""Where troubles melt like lemon drops"" is every bit as charming as its name.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-mk-269222-41102
348,Pizano's,Cuisine Pizza,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"While Chicago may be hailed as home of the deep-dish pizza, the thin-crust pies at Pizano's have justly earned their own devoted following. This refreshing and cozy local spot recalls Italian-American style without feeling like a chain-restaurant cliché; even the waitstaff's genuine warmth is palpable. Of course, the crowds come for the crust-here it is flaky, buttery, thin (by local standards), and perfectly crisp. As unexpected as it sounds, their pizzas are some of the best in town. And yet, it should be no surprise as pizza has long been the family calling: owner Rudy Malnati's father founded Pizzeria Uno. The ""thinner"" offspring at Pizano's sates its growing fan-base from three locations, and even ships to those far from the Second City.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-Pizano_s-326628-41102
349,Vera,Cuisine Spanish,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,,"Pimentón de la Vera, one of the most powerful spices in Spanish cuisine, also provides partial inspiration for this first-come, first-served wine bar in the West Loop dining corridor. (The other homage? Chef/owner Mark Mendez's grandmother.) Exposed brick walls and walnut floors are typically lovely, but do little to soften the din of a happy hour crowd after a few glasses of sherry. Classic tapas as well as ham-and-cheese flights comprise the menu, along with larger plates like a piled-high paella with rabbit, duck, and chorizo. Shell out a few extra dollars for crusty bread to sop up the garlicky, lemony olive oil that bathes their plump head-on shrimp. Grilled rounds of octopus are sweet and smoky thanks to a liberal dose of good old pimentón.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Vera-362556-41102
350,Café des Architectes,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"European sophistication lends extra polish to this shimmering contemporary spot in the Sofitel Hotel, where ""Bonjour"" is passed around freely by the mostly French staff. The dining room is just as chic, with crimson banquettes, black-and-white portraits of the city's architectural marvels, and floor-to-ceiling windows with striking steel accents. The seasonally shifting lineup of small plates is simple but creative, like a single Wianno oyster dabbed with fennel cream and crowned with spoonfuls of both sturgeon and faux citrus caviar. Market-inspired entrées include butternut squash ribbons curling over tender beef short rib and vanilla-tinged salsify purée. For a more casual, small bites affair, move to Le Bar, the hotel's chic watering hole.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Cafe_des_Architectes-268982-41102
351,deca,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Part of the Ritz-Carlton's expansive 12th floor lobby, deca is a casual haunt that still keeps a few high-end accents around. Paintings hung in gilded frames add to the attractiveness in the seated dining area; and a gently trickling sculptural fountain (illuminated by a skylight) offers an auditory escape from the lobby's background buzz. The well-edited menu features light, seasonal dishes that are skillfully prepared. Two large pillows of freshly made squash ravioli are garnished with hearty kale pistou, pickled wild mushrooms, and toasted pepitas. Wild salmon with a crunchy mustard crust is bathed in luxurious garlic-red wine jus. Finish in style with a wedge of tangy lemon tart decorated with fresh raspberries and set atop a neat pool of coulis.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-deca-289574-41102
352,Tête Charcuterie,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"No greater respect can be shown to a former meatpacking warehouse than by converting it into a restaurant specialising in charcuterie. This most ancient of culinary arts is joyfully celebrated here in all its forms-there are cured meats, wonderful glistening terrines, rich pâtés, and plump homemade sausages. This is roll-your-sleeves-up food that will put hair on your chest. The enthusiasm of the on-view kitchen team is palpable. Curing is done in-house and there's a separate Sausage Room where they create their own varieties, which range from a French boudin blanc to Moroccan inspired merguez. But don't think they can't show a light touch when required: the ""spring garden"" served en cocotte is one of the prettiest things you'll see.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60607-Tete_Charcuterie-448338-41102
353,Pelago,Cuisine Italian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"Adjacent to Hotel Raffaello, the elegance of this brick structure is accentuated by large arched windows. Inside, the bi-level room wears a crisp style à la high ceilings, eminently comfortable leather seats, and a soft azure-blue color scheme. If the décor doesn't transport you to the Mediterranean in a flash, look to the regional Italian menu with ingredients imported directly. A salad of plum tomatoes topped with creamy burrata and fragrant basil in a light dressing is as inherently satisfying. So, too, are pasta signatures including rich risotto alle verdure or creamy ricotta-filled ravioli swimming in a vibrant sauce of spinach and showered with slivers of nutty parmesan. Swap dessert for a fine selection of imported cheeses, and never look back.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Pelago-273483-41102
354,Vora,Cuisine Asian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Whether you're a carnivore, herbivore, or somewhere in between, Vora's plethora of Asian offerings aims to please. The modern space puts nature at the forefront with vine-like clusters of light bulbs snaking above bars, room dividers punctuated with floral cutouts, and sprightly lime-green banquettes. Can't choose from the health-oriented lineup of Taiwanese dim sum, Indian curries, or Chinese classics? The dim sum box is actually a bento offering a dizzying array of multi-cultural tastes: soft shrimp siu mai, juicy xiao long bao, steamed pork buns, and miso soup, as well as other bites. Slices of Sichuan beef and vegetables stir-fried with chili sauce can be amped up to match Chinatown's level of heat, or toned down to suit milder tastes.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-Vora-436450-41102
355,Spiaggia,Cuisine Italian,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Very good standard. Our best addresses.","This modern bi-level dining room showcases subdued shades of gray, an intricately tiled marble floor, and spacious seating that only money can buy. Its views of the lake and Magnificent Mile are just as priceless. Glass ""caves"" for wine and cheese, and charcuterie served at the bar whet the appetite. The kitchen reflects its elegant surrounds in treating each meticulously sourced ingredient with care, respect, and talent. Modern twists are clear throughout the menu, yet Spiaggia remains a very classic Italian restaurant. This is immediately evident in pasta courses such as the springy and resilient fresh tajarin; the thin and pale yellow noodles are twirled with a none-too-buttery sauce and generous shaving of fragrant white truffles. ""Little hats"" or cappelletti are stuffed with duck confit, leeks, and Parmigiano, then served in a rich duck consommé amid poached egg and dehydrated hen of the woods mushrooms. Venison with white truffles, chestnut purée, and tart macerated mulberries is amazingly delicate on all levels. Finish with puffs of blood orange meringue with pine-rosemary essence and pine-nut brittle.

The menu is solid and approachable Italian-a decidedly less formal alternative to sophisticated older sister, Spiaggia, next door. Kick things off with the piadini, a thin Romagna-style flatbread, grilled and folded around delicious fillings like mortadella, maybe a caprese, or even chicken and honey. Then, slide on over to the kitchen's focus-gemelli humming with summer beans, preserved lemon, Pecorino Romano, and Prosciutto di Parma.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Cafe_Spiaggia-268981-41102

Communal bar seating keeps the space humming with energy, but moody lighting conspires to keep the vibe relaxed. Though billed as Italian-inspired cooking, the kitchen takes liberties with traditional dishes on the seafood-heavy menu. Well-grilled and generously oiled sourdough fett'unta topped with combinations like baccalà and Dungeness crab are rustic introductions to the meal. Ask for more bread to soak up the Neapolitan-style ragù-a skillet bubbling with goodies like a swordfish meatball and slabs of grilled pork belly in a tomato gravy.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Nico_Osteria-436449-41102

Hugo's bar draws its own crowds with abundant counter seating. The menu focuses on a selection of fish preparations as well as steaks and chops. These are supplemented by stone crab claws, oysters, crab cakes, chowders, and sautéed frog's legs. Speaking of frog's legs, the restaurant takes its name from the nickname of owner Hugo Ralli's grandfather, General Bruce Hay of Her Majesty's Imperial Forces. Bring a football team to share a slice of the Muddy Bottom Pie, a decadent (and enormous) ice cream cake.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60611-Hugo_s_Frog_Bar_Fish_House-289559-41102

Her frequently changing roster of luscious dishes are edible billboards for the foods of the region-think mortadella di Bologna and tartufi neri del'Umbria. Rabbit ragù clings to delicate parsley-flecked bow tie pasta tossed with Parmigiano-Reggiano and copious handfuls of butter. Wine-braised bone-in lamb shank, served in its own rich sauce, needs little else to shine. Signature budino di mascarpone, cioccolato e caffé is the standard-bearer for proper tiramisù, accompanied by tart sugar-coated red currants to offset the creamy sweetness.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-Merlo_on_Maple-294709-41102

If that doesn't scream farm-to-fork cuisine, consider what's being whipped up in the open kitchen (the banquette across from it affords the best view): a ramp raviolo filled with ricotta, a perfectly cooked hen's egg, and enhanced by brown butter and shiitakes; or a halibut fillet with cherry tomatoes and asparagus.

The formal staff tends to diners at white linen-topped tables in the terra cotta-tiled dining room. Chefs in puffy toques man the open kitchen amid shelves of polished copper pans. A wide-ranging menu of modern Italian interpretations takes guests on a whirlwind tour of the boot.

Suits, locals, and Gold Coast power shoppers populate the tables from lunch through dinner, as white-aproned waiters happily uncork bottles of rouge et blanc. Don't look for modern surprises on the menu; contentment here is attained through uncomplicated but expertly prepared French dishes from frites to frisée.

Featuring Arabic-inspired wallpaper and upholstered seats, the setting is as warm and cozy as the open grill blazing away in the kitchen. Build a meal from hot and cold tapas options like muthowma, a blend of silky potatoes and whipped garlic that's perfect for scooping onto warm pita bread. Larger meat platters like a single juicy lamb and beef kifta kabob, served with roasted vegetables and golden saffron rice, make a hearty meal for one.

Southern charm permeates every inch of the room, from the pressed-copper ceiling to the white sideboards to a wood-burning oven churning out the restaurant's signature biscuits. The meal might get started with an amuse-bouche of deviled eggs topped with pickled mustard seeds, and if it's a Sunday or Monday, the famous fried chicken will be making an appearance on many plates. Plump fried green tomatoes and thick pork chops are on order, but for a true down-home taste, get a tall wedge of hummingbird cake, fragrant with banana and pineapple and slathered in cream cheese frosting.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-Table_Fifty_Two-269254-41102

Baby back ribs-so tender they're practically falling off the bone-are served with a trio of house-made sauces for dipping and slathering.

As imagined by prolific Chef/owner Bill Kim, the Asian barbecue experience at BellyQ takes its form in a number of genre-melding shareable plates.

Under the direction of Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the seasonal American menu is as casually riveting as the décor.

Unbelievably tender grilled octopus is plated with beef-braised carrots and fried bone marrow-enriched romesco; and the honeycomb-topped chocolate tart tastes as silky as a bowl of pudding.

If the book-length menu seems overwhelming, scan the list of favorites at the beginning for a quick pick-be sure to avoid any items marked with a chili if you'd rather walk on the mild side.

Dim sum is a popular choice even on weekdays, with diners making selections from photographic menus rather than waiting for a passing cart. Among the numerous options, juicy har gao, stuffed with plump seasoned shrimp, always hit the spot. Pan-fried turnip cakes are simultaneously crispy and creamy, studded with bits of pork and mushroom, and fluffy, subtly sweet Malay steamed egg cake is a rare find for dessert.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-_-MingHin-326622-41102

While there are no tabletop grills smoking up the dining room, the picnic-style tables fill quickly with generous portions of kitchen-grilled bulgogi, warming stews, and banchan. A crimson kimchi jjigae broth, seamlessly balanced between sour and spicy, bobs with soft chunks of tofu and pork. Bibimbap sizzles in a stone bowl, letting the requisite crispy crust form on the bottom while diners dig into a mountain of glistening sweet soy kalbi, crunchy vegetables, and fried egg.

Though the rollicking bar up front takes its cues from a swinging Wild West saloon, the rear dining room offers a more sedate-though still eclectic-setting for sipping house cocktails and chowing down on sensational smoked meats. You'll need two hands to hold homemade empanadas stuffed with combinations like Manchego cheese and shiitake mushrooms, and extra cottony white bread to soak up the juices of bone-in, wood-smoked chicken. Brisket chili is even more robust with a scoop of creamy mac and cheese-and if you're still hungry, soda floats with Bridgeport-made Filbert's root beer are the cherry on top.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60608-Honky_Tonk_BBQ-471938-41102

Knowledgeable, on-point service makes the meal even more divine. Start with a choice from the large vermouth selection and a round of burrata with pickled mustard seeds and fresh mint, ready to be piled on lardo-brushed toast. Or sink your teeth into wood-fired pizza with a parade of toppings like pistachio pesto and crisp mortadella. For dessert, brandy-soaked cherries add boozy warmth to caramel budino with salty-sweet praline crumble.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60610-Balena-366455-41102

Then consider the fact that the owners of Longman & Eagle are behind this operation and know that you're in for some seriously unique and outstanding eats. Housed in a booming, hipster-centric corner of the lower west side, this stylish public hall has major cool factor and enough real estate to be a triple threat. Framed by windows, the dining room is on the main floor while the upstairs (Thalia Hall) is a live music venue. Service throughout is very cordial, so settle in and await a spread of quirky American food. The menu changes daily so don't get hung up on favorites. However, smash-hits may include a wood-roasted cheese-stuffed pretzel coupled with wasabi dipping sauce as well as an ultra-decadent blue crab dip paired with artichoke relish and crusty, house-made pain d'epi. Live out your gourmet gastropub fantasy with slow-cooked salmon sporting a salty crust and spiced with salsa verde; or gnocchi tossed with lamb Bolognese and creamy ricotta.

A century-old wooden slab finds new life as a sushi counter, where diners sip sodas from Ball jars and groove to hip tunes. Whole ginger- and garlic-glazed grilled squid is sliced into rings, then sprinkled with scallions and creamy jalapeño sauce. Succulent robata-grilled skewers, purchased by the piece, arrive with specialized accompaniments like marinated pork shoulder with sweet chili sauce or kalbi-glazed short rib.

Excellent standard.","Who needs a meal followed by a show when you can have both together? That's because eating at Alinea, which involves around 20 courses over about three hours, is more than simply dinner-it's culinary theater. Perhaps it could qualify for a Tony Award along with its Michelin stars, because you're even invited backstage afterwards to meet the talented protagonists in the kitchen. Alinea provides such a vivid, visceral experience, that you'll even forget about the somewhat painful and entirely inhospitable booking procedure. Neophytes have nothing to fear here as there's a veritable army of charming, clued-up helpers and servers to guide you effortlessly through each and every dish. And guidance is certainly needed because the only menu you'll see is the one presented to you like an award certificate as you leave. The cooking is strikingly original and very clever. It can surprise but it can also challenge; at times dishes can be playful or even whimsical. But underpinning all those clever techniques and all those dazzling arrangements and quite striking presentations is an inherent understanding of flavor-and this is what gives the cooking such great depth.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Alinea-268970-41102

Very good standard.","Housed in an affluent part of town, find a small walkway that leads into this elaborate, handsome, and very sultry dining room. There are three different seating areas and each exudes class with a bit of romance, whimsy, and occasional quirk (note the escutcheon-covered doorway and capricious paintings). Against dark pebbled walls, find oversized horseshoe booths, long banquettes, and mirrored light bulbs casting funky shadows. The semi-outdoor solarium has a living wall of moss and ferns. Servers are friendly and genuine without a hint of pretense. This is the kind of place where one can sink in and not care to leave. Chef Lee Wolen's menu may be modern, but it is widely appealing with a Mediterranean edge. Begin with translucent slivers of fresh sea bass that get a pleasant chew from almond crumble and perfect flavor from a subtle dab of citrusy yuzu kosho. Then, deliciously tender and evenly pink Colorado lamb is served with a harmonious hodgepodge of creamy yogurt, charred lettuce, and nearly sweet baby potatoes. For dessert, an airy and whipped mound of praline-flavored mousse is set beside milk ice cream, which serves as a cooling counterpoint to the nutty flavors throughout and makes for a fine ending.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Boka-268977-41102

Even Chicagoans who've never set foot in this spacious location know about its near-monopoly at White Sox games (including a complimentary shuttle to U.S. Cellular Field) and constant presence at citywide festivals. Those who do step inside the flagship come for the convivial vibe and, of course, pizza. Of the many options, the deep-dish is Miss Popularity, but it's fun to go one further with a stuffed pizza topped with a buttery crust. The garlic- and oregano-laced sauce is pleasantly tangy, and carnivores sing the praises of Connie's plump fennel sausage. Call ahead to forego the 45-minute cooking time and pick your pie up at the drive-thru.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60616-Connie_s_Pizza-294707-41102

Don your catwalk best before visiting: a fashion-centric display near a long communal table hints at the chichi theme present throughout. The décor is cutting-edge, but the menu respects and returns to Italian standbys. Gnocco fritto, a dough pillow served with charcuterie, is irresistible to even the most willowy fashionistas; while cracker-crisp artisan pizzas from wood-burning ovens are equally pleasing. Traditional involtini di pollo, pounded thin and rolled around prosciutto, gets a hit of brightness from lemon and white wine sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-tocco-296390-41102

You'll also have lots of opportunity to study the lace curtains as you plow through their extensive draft beer menu, noted on blackboards in the comfortably worn-in front bar room. Decadent foie gras corn dogs (actually French garlic sausage wrapped with soft-sweet brioche cornbread) and veal brats with melted Gouda elevate the humble sausage; while a slew of sandwiches suit simpler tastes. Grilled cheese gilds the lily with taleggio, raclette, and Irish cheddar; and dreamy house-made chips drizzled with truffle oil and malt vinegar are more than a bar snack.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Bangers_Lace-337544-41102

The crowds come for large portions of straightforward Mexican favorites like slabs of carne asada with warm corn tortillas to wrap the lightly seasoned meat and beans. Munch on a complimentary beef-and-potato soft taco while poring over the extensive menu. Sizzling platters arrive in a heartbeat once the order's been placed.

Inside, glasses of crimson and rosé sangria are in everyone's hands, helping the noise skyrocket as the night wears on. Look at the colorful chalk-drawn mural above the kitchen, depicting Spanish scenes, products, and food terms, to get a sense of what's on offer. Shareable plates mix tradition with contemporary twists, like crispy hollowed-out patatas bravas filled with ketchup and aïoli. A half-dozen pickled mussels arrive in a tin beneath a layer of creamy potato foam; while an excellent consommé poured over a farm egg yolk and truffles is brightened by a dash of manzanilla sherry.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Black_Bull-373412-41102

Though both chilaquiles and sesame-crusted tilapia tacos find their way on to the menu, Pl-zenˇ offers a full slate of gastropub fare that steps away from the traditional Mexican bent of the neighborhood. Raisin- and pignoli-studded boar meatballs are simmered in tomato sauce and finished with ricotta and caramelized onions. A poached egg adds richness to crispy pig ear salad with Fresno chili aïoli. Cinnamon-sugar beignets deserve a dip in luscious strawberry-pinot grigio sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60608-Pl_zen-399956-41102

Offerings at this hip haven crisscross the globe, melding diverse ingredients for an utterly unique dining experience. Shredded kohlrabi substitutes green papaya for a Thai-inspired salad tossed with candied shrimp, poached chicken, and plenty of fresh herbs. Stuffed cabbage bears a Korean accent with tender chunks of slow-braised pork, tangy Napa cabbage kimchi, and crunchy sticky rice.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Mott_St-409363-41102

Mana may be a tiny spot, but its diverse menu of vegetarian dishes is big on taste-and spice. Korean bibimbap mixes a roster of vegetables like pea pods, roasted carrots, and pickled daikon with a fresh sunny side-up egg; while horseradish and cracked black pepper sneak into macaroni and cheese.

Seafood is the focus of the unique menu, and octopus reigns supreme. The eight-armed delicacy works its way into a number of items including pulpo ceviche and the Kraken taco, which features a grilled, pesto-marinated version. Equally excellent are the poblano tacos stuffed with smoked rainbow trout, charred corn, and a creamy salsa made from roasted pumpkin seeds and Serrano chiles.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Kokopelli-473931-41102

No matter which barbecue style you pledge allegiance to-Kansas City, Memphis, or Carolina-you'll find something worth gnawing on, from moist pulled pork and chicken to spare and baby back ribs. Order any sandwich ""Daddy Style"" to get a few slices of brisket slapped on top, or fill up on jalapeño cornbread.

There's even a countdown showing the number of days till summer. The menu proves a good fit for the surroundings by keeping things easy.

This tiny trattoria nestled between Ukrainian Village's brick buildings is indeed a speck of warmth and charm, festooned with party lights on the patio and mustard-toned walls inside. Traditional Italian cuisine gets personalized tweaks from the chef. Carpacci may include paper-thin octopus, beets, or beef; macaroncini alla Briciola folds diced Tuscan sausage into a spicy garlic-sage sauce; and a hefty bone-in pork chop, pounded thin, breaded, and pan-fried until golden, is a house classic dressed with arugula and shaved parmesan.

The menu of small plates is influenced by both hearty gastropub dishes and lighter Mediterranean bites. Tabasco mash ketchup heats up a plate of charred, tender octopus, while a poached egg gilds rich duck confit tossed with cavatelli.

When a utilitarian and self-consciously bare interior seems modern and industrial. When temporarily disconnected phone lines and full mailboxes make every hipster in the room feel like he hit the jackpot to score this reservation. The booming hip-hop peppered with expletives reflects the deeply talented chefs' ethos, going well beyond laissez-faire to reach the point of ""we don't give a damn."" That said, you probably won't either. The food really is that good. The 14-course nightly tasting has no menu really to speak of, but there are plenty of tattooed servers ready to describe each dish with details that come at you rapid fire. While some courses may seem way out of balance in terms of flavor and textural complexity, others have been known to show nuance and delicacy-as evident in the smooth and fine Osetra caviar sitting in a mélange of cashew nut purée, tender hearts of palm, and fried plantain chips; or a single quail egg raviolo with its glossy and unctuous brown butter sauce. Desserts can be pure genius, beginning with watermelon ice and unagi ice cream-a sprinkle of togarashi perfectly foils the intensity of this treat.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60662-Schwa-269239-41102

Chef Michael Taus has designed a menu made for grazing: think charcuterie, cheese, and starters including a sunchoke dosa. Made from lentils and basmati rice, this lacy crêpe is topped with chunks of tender sunchokes in a spicy red curry sauce sweetened by golden raisins and candied pumpkin seeds. A tasting portion of pan-seared fluke, plated with sweet chili vinaigrette and a Korean-style pancake studded with dried shrimp, is equally delicious.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Taus_Authentic-473932-41102

Seasonal American cooking pulls inspiration from the Mediterranean in dishes like plump double-boned pork chop Lyonnaise, cooked to a juicy medium, draped in herbed demi-glace, and nestled with cipollini onions and roasted fingerling potatoes.

Crispy battered fish is spiced up with sriracha-tartar sauce and chilled smoked cabbage slaw. Shredded roast pork is rubbed with adobo, glazed in tamarind, and joined with creamy avocado and queso fresco for tasty carnitas. Pickled red onions add punch to chunky guacamole.

As befits the word ""trattoria,"" rustic Italian preparations take precedence, but the simplicity satisfies. Chunks of pork sausage add heft to a heaping bowl of hand-rolled cavatelli bathed in a light tomato cream sauce, and curls of grilled calamari need only a squirt of lemon, splash of olive oil, and sprinkle of parsley to sing.

In fact, ""It's A Small World"" could be the unofficial theme song for their lineup of steamed buns and comforting ramen bowls showcasing noodles hand-pulled in-house each day: fiery kochujang complements barbecue chicken on the pollo bun, while the saltimbocca bun goes Italian with sage, prosciutto, and mozzarella.

For a sweet finale, dig into a creamy pistachio kulfi or opt for a light and fruity mango lassi.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Cumin-296384-41102
421,Takito Kitchen,Cuisine Mexican,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Chicago's upscale taco circuit gets a new contender with Takito, where fresh ingredients make Latin-inspired food sing. Tequila takes pride of place in a chile-salted margarita, while skylights and mirrors make the narrow, mod-industrial space seem even brighter and larger. Sure, you can get a corn tortilla here, but sesame and hibiscus options let the kitchen get creative as evident in tacos filled with cornmeal-crusted redfish, beef barbacoa, or tamarind-chayote pequin. Shared plates like sope de carne asada blur culinary boundaries with the addition of Brunkow cheddar and green onion kimchi. It's an across-the-board mishmash of colorful flavors, but certainly a good way to go over the top. Sister spot Bar Takito also boasts a notably concise menu.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Takito_Kitchen-399944-41102
422,Greentea,Cuisine Japanese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Regulars would rather your eyes glaze past Greentea's nondescript storefront so they can keep this secret to themselves. The bento box-sized room isn't glitzy, so the scene is limited to a few lucky cat sculptures and plants to punctuate the seafoam green walls. Otherwise, the focus is kept on the itamae in colorful chef's coats and the pristinely fresh seafood they're preparing. Purists love the well-priced nigiri, sashimi, and manageably sized rolls showcasing silky hamachi or glistening uni with a touch of minerality. Tiger Eyes salad is a visual showstopper: squid stuffed with smoked salmon, julienned cucumber, and marinated carrots sliced into thin rounds are a clever and flavorful resemblance to an orange-pupiled eye.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Greentea-362550-41102
423,Mirai,Cuisine Japanese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Mirai is a bit like Disney World. You know it's not real, but who cares? The Japanese food is westernized and by no means traditional, but unless you're dining out with Mr. Shinzo Abe, rest assured that nobody will cry foul. Bold and appetizing flavors beg to take center stage. It's really all about the fish at this spot-just look around and you'll find most devotees feasting on sashimi, unagi, and maki. If raw fish doesn't float your boat, take a shot at one of the house specialties like kani nigiri, a baked king crab concoction. There is also a surfeit of hot dishes-think chicken togarashi with spicy, sweet, and tangy flavors. Affable and alert service combined with a relaxed atmosphere make this a hit among area residents.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Mirai-281117-41102
424,Aquitaine,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"When Lincoln Park locals want French-inspired cuisine, they head to Aquitaine for a taste of Chef/owner Holly Willoughby's refined cooking. Dim lighting and subtle brocade details on the walls keep the long, narrow dining room casually romantic, with enough simple sophistication to swing a Saturday night date or weekday post-work dinner. A well-priced wine list only adds to the elegant appeal. Large chunks of succulent lobster are a luxe touch in a ramekin of tender potato gnocchi bathed in creamy sauce. Eggplant, olive, and tomato relish give double-cut lamb chops a Provençal spin, heightened by a drizzle of basil pesto. Textbook-perfect crème brûlée needs only a tap of the spoon to send its delicate sugar crust splintering into the silken custard.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Aquitaine-339783-41102
425,Mon Ami Gabi,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"A real French bistro can give an American steakhouse a run for its money in the meat department any day, and the 11 different steak preparations on Mon Ami Gabi's menu (all served with crispy golden frites) are justly impressive. Beyond the butcher case, a selection of satisfying Francophile classics keeps the sophisticated Chicago contingent returning to this cozy, stylish standby. Tradition reigns in the kitchen, where the emphasis is on flavorful and unpretentious dishes like seafood pot-au-feu bobbing with scallops and pepper-crusted cod fillet in a tasty fennel broth. Pickled cornichons and warm toast points make a meal out of house-made country pâté. And for an indulgent finish, split a plate of warm caramel-drizzled pineapple crêpes.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Mon_Ami_Gabi-294711-41102
426,Nando Milano Trattoria,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"A corner bar television constantly tuned to (European) football, vintage aperitivo posters, and a welcoming patio tailor-made for afternoon glasses of prosecco: charismatic host Dario Vullo has installed his own little slice of Milan in Wicker Park. The chic trattoria offers an intensely Italian menu and wine list to match the authentic accents of Vullo and family. A trio of arancini are playfully prepared, with each rice ball sporting a unique shape-sphere, triangle, and cube-to denote a special filling like Bolognese ragù and smoked mozzarella; or mascarpone and spinach. House-made pastas like beet gnocchi in saffron sauce steal the show from equally flavorful and fresh focaccia sandwiches layered with creamy burrata and Prosciutto di Parma.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Nando_Milano_Trattoria-408491-41102
427,Las Palmas,Cuisine Mexican,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Vivid décor complements the spirited flavors on the menu at Las Palmas, from the colorful Mexican artwork on adobe-style walls to exposed ductwork welded to resemble a scaly dragon winding through the deceptively large space. If the weather suits, the outdoor garden or glassed-in atrium beckon; if not, a cozy fireplace in the front room keeps things intimate. The cocktail menu draws inspiration from both South and Central America, featuring a variety of capirinhas and mojitos alongside inventive cucumber-lime and pineapple margaritas. Vibrant and modern Mexican dishes like crispy taquitos with chicken barbacoa, pickled red onion, and tangy salsa cruda; as well as seafood-filled cornmeal empanadas with peanut-jalapeño relish showcase the kitchen's flair.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Las_Palmas-326631-41102
428,Lillie's Q,Cuisine Barbecue,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Bucktown's urban barbecue shack takes a scholarly approach to 'cue, as each table bears a caddy stocked with six regionally specific sauces for embellishing the slow-smoked meats to come. Cocktails served in Mason jars are a specialty made from ""moonshine"" offered at three proof levels, and servers in modern mechanic's shirts tend to the crowds clamoring for heaps of smoked meats rubbed in ""Carolina dirt."" Tri-tip is tender and pink-tinged after its time in the smoker with the joint's signature dry rub; while the succulent smoked hot link rests in a butter-griddled, top-sliced brioche bun served with Southern-style coleslaw. And if at-home grilling is your thing, you'll be pleased to know that the mouthwatering sauces are available by mail order.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Lillie_s_Q-296388-41102
429,Rickshaw Republic,Cuisine Indonesian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard. Our best addresses.,"The captivating flavors of Southeast Asian street food are matched by the creative design at this friendly, family-run Lincoln Avenue space. Color and pattern collide as parasols, puppets, and bird cages vie for attention with abstract Indonesian wood carvings. Once the food arrives, though, the spotlight shifts to the aromatic plates. Start with crisp martabak crêpes that behold a savory combination of beef, onions, and egg. Then move on to lemongrass-braised chicken thighs in a turmeric-tinged coconut curry with sweet and spicy tamarind sambal and pickled cabbage. Surprise your palate with es cendol, a mix of coconut milk and green pandan jelly in palm sugar syrup. Finally, take one of Mama Setiawan's homemade sambals home to bring color to your cooking.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Rickshaw_Republic-399954-41102
430,Big Star,Cuisine Mexican,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"Bucktown's favorite taqueria has all the fixings for a fiesta. Craft beers, custom-bottled Bourbons, and pitchers of margaritas wash down the affordable abundance. And, despite the grungy décor, the vibe is as intoxicating as the aroma of the taco de chorizo verde. The patio is even more of a party, and sun-starved Chicagoans can be spotted out there soon after the groundhog has (or hasn't) seen his shadow. Tacos are served individually, thus allowing ample opportunity to graze on the likes of the pollo pibil-achiote- and citrus-marinated chicken thighs steamed in banana leaves, topped with pickled onion slices and cilantro. Save room for the salsa de frijole con queso, a crock of pinto bean dip accompanied by lime salt-sprinkled tortilla chips.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Big_Star-296345-41102
431,Taxim,Cuisine Greek,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Though Taxim channels the spirit of Greece in its food, the Moroccan-esque décor takes inspiration from Turkey and other Mediterranean coastal neighbors. The large room glints with light from hanging Moorish lanterns and copper-topped tables. Share small plates on the sidewalk patio to take full advantage of Wicker Park people-watching. Many of Taxim's dishes get a modern twist while remaining respectful to the islands' traditional cuisine. Wild Greek oregano and ouzo-preserved lemon offer a perfect balance to roasted Amish Miller Farms chicken; while loukoumades prove that no one can resist fried dough, especially when tossed in wildflower honey and topped with rosewater-infused pastry cream. The all-Greek wine list is an adventure for oenophiles.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Taxim-289572-41102

Simple standard.","With a chill, throwback vibe, all-day breakfast, and a drink list with more than 70 labels of agave spirits, this One Off Hospitality roadhouse is a Wicker Park hipster's dream come true. To drive the point home, the diner features wood-paneled walls, counter seating, a record player spinning the blues, and of course, Tex-Mex fare listed on a wall-mounted letter board. The daily special may be a blueberry quinoa pancake, while savory favorites include crunchy buttermilk fried chicken with chorizo verde gravy or the farmer's cheese-stuffed Anaheim chile relleno, served in a pool of tomato-serrano sauce with pasilla chiles and pickled chayote slices. Pies from Hoosier Mama Pie Co. are a grand finale; try the lemony Atlantic Beach with a saltine crust.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-Dove_s_Luncheonette-473929-41102
433,White Oak Tavern & Inn,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Though there was a late summer (2015) transition in chefs, a creative sense of flavor combinations and technical finesse continue to flourish at this appealingly rustic restaurant and inn. Midwestern hospitality and bounty are at the forefront here, and every ingredient on each section of the multi-category menu is of irreprehensible quality. The in-house cheese-making and bread programs are on full display as evidenced in a bowl of stracciatella, where mozzarella mingles with pickled shallot rings next to fluffy, griddled focaccia sticks. A whiff of smoke uplifts moist, meaty sturgeon, simply seared and surrounded by candied hickory nuts and nutty crème fraîche; while a refined and clever root vegetable tartare is deliciously crowned by a sous vide duck egg.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-White_Oak_Tavern_Inn-474200-41102
434,Enso,Cuisine Japanese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"All bases are covered at Enso, from tempura to ramen and chirashi to teriyaki, but it's mostly about maki. There are fairly classic combinations of ingredients on offer, but also more challenging blends of flavor. If you can't decide then you can always ""make your own maki""-but you'll only have yourself to blame should the memory of your chosen flavors return to haunt you at a later date. The homemade steamed buns are also worthy; a filling of roasted pork belly with pickled vegetables inside one of these little pillows of delight is hard to beat. The vaulted room looks like a Goth's cellar, all black and moody, with the open kitchen at the far end shining like a beacon of hope. Larger parties should try to snare one of the low-slung booths.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60647-Enso-399942-41102

Good standard.","Grab a taxi and head to the warehouses of Bridgeport, where this stylish, modern tavern-from neighborhood native Kevin Hickey-feels like a diamond in the rough. Through a set of French doors, the hubbub brought on by intricate cocktails in the retro globe-lit lounge leads to a decorous dining room with wide wooden tables and curvy midcentury seating. Beyond the kitchen's signature rotisserie duck for two, the menu spreads its wings with a focused but diverse selection of small plates and entrées. Briny sea beans are the crowning touch to a winning dish of uni butter-slathered spot prawns and creamy risotto, while a duo of pickle- and beer-brined chicken thigh and drumstick glisten with a tableside finish of smoked paprika jus.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60608-The_Duck_Inn-471937-41102

Choose from a litany of salads, sandwiches, and drinks from oversized chalkboard menus behind the counter; then stake out one of the premium second-floor tables. Upstairs, chandeliers, cozy couches, and scattered antiques (not to mention frequent study groups guzzling caffeine and homemade cookies) lend character. Many sandwiches take names from literary works, like The Old Man and the Sea (tuna salad) or Catcher in the Rye (reuben). The muffuletta is a lightly pressed panini rendition of the New Orleans standard, stacking a deli's worth of ham, salami, mortadella, provolone, and mild giardiniera in fresh focaccia for a hearty yet delicate bite.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Bourgeois_Pig_Cafe-268978-41102

Housed in a former Russian bathhouse, the black-and-white tiles and notched brick walls dividing the eclectic warren of rooms give a nod to the former tenant of this 1920s building. Bar snacks and weekend brunch are taken just as seriously as full-on lunch and dinner here. Corned beef adds a manly touch to eggs Benedict, especially when drizzled with piquant choron sauce. Dense pretzel cinnamon rolls straddle the salty-sweet line. A menu favorite at any time of day, fried pickle tots are served with kicky beet-tinged red onion yogurt and thinly sliced chicken breast bresaola.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60647-Trenchermen-373418-41102

High-ceilinged rooms are lined with colorful murals of small-town life, and wide-open front windows invite in warm evening breezes. Live mariachi bands turn up the heat on weekends. Creative Mexican fare begins with the usual suspects like tacos al pastor and piquant, spunky house-made salsa, but unique dishes broaden the offerings. Here, a bowl of fundido is a Latin cousin to spinach-and-artichoke dip, with a blend of tangy cheeses and plenty of roasted poblanos for extra heat. Pan-fried pork tenderloin medallions come smothered in tomatillo sauce alongside drunken beans, bacon-wrapped shrimp, and a side of smashed red potatoes with oozing Chihuahua cheese.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Fiesta_Mexicana-289560-41102

Get the point yet? Decadent chocolate is the name of the game here, though guests will be delighted to discover savory items beyond their expectations. Try the roasted tomato soup, garnished with bright green onion slivers; or the BLT with pesto aïoli, heirloom tomato, avocado, and thick, crispy maple-cayenne bacon.

Good standard.","Free your mind, keep your expectations high, and ignore the hand-made sign and desolate locale that make this undeniably edgy restaurant feel like a David Lynch movie. No one comes here for high-end pampering. Rather, the interior is an amalgam of heavy wood timber, zinc ductwork, abstract art, and a homespun curtain made of wine corks. The open kitchen and its team of freewheeling anti-heroes lend a dinner-party vibe, with guests bringing bottles of Bourbon as gifts for the chefs and others getting up to mingle. Woe to those who come here to dine alone. This prix-fixe is an all-embracive antithesis to highfalutin fine dining, with courses that the chef might describe as salty-sweet stoner food. Envision golden-fried potatoes in a piping hot leek soup, topped with liquid nitrogen-prepared vanilla ice cream that pops and crackles when poured overtop. The result is a brilliant playfulness that hits all the right gustatory notes.

Grab that cutlery before digging into the buttery crust of each deep-dish pie, ringed with blackened cheese at the edges.

Though known for its sushi, grilled items like juicy beef tongue complement the roster of exceptionally fresh bites. Smoky seared saba and octopus sashimi are served with typically restrained seasoning, needing nothing more than a dab of soy and dip in pickled wasabi sauce.

Also worth trying are the steamed mandoo (pork dumplings) and the curiously addictive tacos made with paratha. Simply place your order at the counter, grab a plastic fork and, if you're with friends, commandeer the large communal table.

Thin slices of lamb kidney are dry stir-fried, their mild flavor boosted by copious amounts of cumin and red chilies. Then, a sweet and sour sauce offsets the funky flavor of quick-fried intestine, tripe, and liver; and pickled cabbage and pork meatball soup, boosted by tofu and noodles, is a welcome warmer on cold days.

A mosaic-tiled wood-burning oven gleams from the rear of the dimly lit space, brightened by sunny yellow and Mediterranean blue walls. Craft beer nerds should take a seat at the bar for a sampling from the varied list of artisanal Italian brews. Authentic Neapolitan pizzas share menu space with modern stuffed ""bomba"" pies like the Ciotta Ciotta, which mounds a deli case's worth of salumi and cheeses between two pizza dough rounds. Pasta selections are equally sprawling, and include fresh combinations like pappardelle with plump mussels, black truffles, and pecorino.

Their home-style cooking would make any Boricua proud, offering standards from mofongo to lechon and even the holiday favorite of coquito-with much less of the heaviness often associated with the traditional cuisine. As the story goes, the jibarito was created by Chicago's Puerto Rican community, and La Plena's rendition-featuring thin steak strips, garlicky mayonnaise, and melted cheese between fried flattened plantains-is an exceptional example. For dessert, dig into a slice of dense, eggy flan while you take in the dining room's custom murals that showcase Puerto Rico's beaches and countryside.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60622-La_Plena-471933-41102

With a plain, tavern-like bar up front as well as a bright, inviting dining room and counter (the best seat in the house) in back, this low-key spot is popular for a casual meal. The menu offers cool bites like the Juno queen, a special nigiri of salmon topped with spicy scallop and potato crunch; and hot treats like honey-glazed quail. Chef B.K. Park's omakase must be ordered 48-hours in advance, but with cleverly spun morsels like briefly torched prawn with pineapple salsa, pickled garlic oil-drizzled New Zealand King salmon, soy-marinated sea eel dabbed with ground sesame seeds, and spicy octopus temaki, it's a feast well worth the extra effort.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60614-Juno-474198-41102

A devoted breakfast crowd takes up residence at the coffee bar and butcher block tables each day, often perusing the colorful modern artwork for sale on the walls. Locally sourced and organic are the guiding principles behind every ingredient here; many dishes also get a little Latin flavor. Soft avocado wedges are tossed in panko, then flash-fried for a crispy exterior and creamy center.

Korean barbecued beef is a favorite, but regulars enjoy new tastes from the roster of daily specials that can include the lechon tostada.

As expected, many dishes feature cheese, though shareable plates run from house-made charcuterie to bone-in pork chops.

Familiar favorites and seasonal specials make for a festive mix of adventurous, yet universally pleasing dishes. Flat corn tortillas form a sandwich-style enchilada, stuffed with fork-tender beef brisket and topped with crunchy strands of sweet potato slaw.

The casual menu pays homage to classic coastal fish shacks, yet throws in a few gussied-up items like tartare and octopus à la plancha.

Since Kanela is Greek for ""cinnamon,"" the signature pastry is appropriately loaded with spiced sugar, vanilla frosting, and blueberries. A flight of four kinds of French toast sweetens the deal for indecisive types.

Choose from seasonal American food like roasted venison with creamed spinach as well as homemade sausage and spaetzle.

As per the name, poultry and piscine offerings are house specialties, with signature golden-fried chicken (and equally popular Negroni slushies) on many tables.

A stack of small plates on each table sends the message that everything on the menu is meant for sharing.

Good standard.","Hiding in plain sight on a residential Logan Square block, Jam remains the sweetheart of brunch-o-philes who won't settle for some greasy spoon. Clean white walls and gray stone tables punctuated by lime green placemats give a gallery-like feel to the space; a friendly welcome and wide-open kitchen keep it homey. Their brunch standards like French toast are nothing short of luxurious: think brioche soaked in vanilla- and malt-spiked custard cooked sous vide to absorb every drop, then caramelized in a sizzling pan and garnished with lime leaf-whipped cream and pineapple compote. Braised beef, tangy tomato crema, and smoked Gouda are rolled into lacy buckwheat crêpes and topped with a sunnyside egg for an elegant take on the breakfast burrito.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-_-Jam-373571-41102

No matter what's on the constantly evolving menu, the fresh, seasonal, and always original fare keeps the casual spot slammed with the creative denizens of Logan Square from morning to night. The mouthwatering fixings in Lula's Royale breakfast sandwich change with the seasons and might include thin slices of meaty, tender short rib, a sunny-side up farm egg, smoky cumin aïoli and bitter orange jam served alongside a salad of vinegary carrot, daikon, and cilantro.

Good standard.","Not familiar with the food of Macau? Not to worry-Fat Rice turns the uninitiated into believers nightly. A wooden pergola shelters hardy souls braving the infamous wait for a table. Bar seating around the open kitchen gives a bird's-eye view of the mélange of ingredients used in each dish, though servers are happy to walk any guest through the intoxicating mashup of Portuguese and Asian cuisine. Sharing is recommended for platters like the namesake arroz gordo, a paella-esque blend of meat, shellfish, and pickles. Pillowy bread sops up chunky olive-and-bacalhau spread in a pool of verdant olive oil.

Simple standard.","The focus at this Wrigleyville institution is on speedy, authentic Thai food-and that's exactly what you'll get. Colorful orchids brighten up the minimal space, where solo diners sit at the narrow center bar and people-watchers keep an eye on the hustle and bustle outside from high tables near the windows. Two laminated menus-one with standard fare, and another ""secret"" listing with more traditional dishes-ensure there's something for everyone. It's hard to resist double-dipping a stack of glistening, charred moo ping pork skewers in sour, spicy, and sweet sauce, or finishing every flaky morsel of pad ped pla duk (fried catfish with creamy green curry).

Simple standard.","Poised along a trendy corner and marked by a single ampersand over the door, this is the ultimate merger of the Old World and New Order. It's the kind of place where remnants of a glorious past live in harmony with more current elements, and where chefs prefer bandanas and beards to toques. Yet, the cuisine is as haute as ever. Millennials never tire of this local hangout and its numerous dining nooks, including the hip and happening bar that pours an exceptional carte of cocktails; a boisterous front dining room; as well as an exposed brick alcove that flaunts both space and privacy. Open from early to late, the jumping tavern cooks up an exciting lineup of truly extraordinary fare. Make a decadent start with duck (pastrami, confit, and heart) in a jar neatly coupled with rice, beans, and potatoes. Black bass, fried oysters, and green tomato chow chow in a Southern pork broth is another rich dish; while buckwheat cannelloni with chickpeas, French feta, and fennel barigoule in soubise is as wholesome as it is heavenly. At the end, black sesame doughnuts with tapioca and coconut are creamy, crunchy, and certify nothing short of sweet dreams-perhaps in one of the hotel rooms above the bar?",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60647-Longman_Eagle-289577-41102

Diners show up in droves for a rotating selection of steamed buns, crispy chicken bits, and slurpable noodle bowls. ""Logan Poser Ramen"" showcases Chef/owner Matthias Merges' house-made noodles, a swirl of thick, al dente strands in spicy tonkatsu broth. A poached hen egg and crispy pig's tail croquette take it over the top. Vegetarians delight in an elegant pickled gobo root salad with translucent Asian pear and black plum slices and silky tofu-tobanjan dressing.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60618-Yusho-366453-41102

It's not for the faint of heart: between the crowds, the crunching blasts of sound, and the NC-17 artwork. Steady yourself with a beer or Bourbon while waiting for a table and a juicy patty. The lines wouldn't be stretching out the door if the kitchen weren't cranking out kick-ass burgers. The menu features more than a dozen options of 10-oz. monsters served on pretzel rolls with myriad toppings like roasted garlic mayonnaise, house-made hot sauce, and pepper jack cheese.

The menu may be hell for vegans, but it's a pork lover's paradise: cuts from every part of the animal find their way into nearly each dish, from hearty ham-stuffed burgers to the signature bacon-wrapped jalapeño poppers. Gently charred slabs of ribs basted with the Piggery's own heady barbecue sauce are teeth-sinkingly tender. Even salads may give you the meat sweats, with pulled pork or buffalo chicken-and bacon, of course-offered as toppings.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60613-The_Piggery-337549-41102

Young foodies fill the space every night, whether seated at tables lining the wooden banquette or perched on colorful stools dotting a double-sided slab of counter, half of which faces the open kitchen. Clark and Kim's exemplary cuisine results from a deep understanding of the Korean pantry as well as a brilliant application of au courant technique to seasonal product. Baked potato bing bread, the restaurant's signature flaky flatbread carb-bomb, is stuffed with melted scallions and bacon bits, topped with nutty sesame, and served with sour cream butter. Then, cauliflower is deep-fried, set over cool, herbaceous raita, and studded with shards of spicy tandoori chicken skin; while dukbokki, or Korean rice cakes, are pan-crisped and combined with bits of succulent goat meat sausage and refreshingly bitter wilted rapini.

Luckily, the extensive menu makes it easy to do just that. Tender egg noodles absorb the fragrant coconut curry in a bowl of kow soy that's redolent of citrusy coriander and served with pickled greens and cilantro.

Haemul pajeon stuffed with squid and scallions is a crisp, golden-fried delight; and kimchi jjigae is a rich, bubbling, and nourishing broth packed with soft tofu and tender pork.

That glass-tiled custom Bisazza wood-burning oven in the center of the open kitchen is a tip-off, too. The casual menu features a dozen varieties of red or white pizzas, along with antipasti and desserts for those who need more than a pie.

In fact, it's hardly a restaurant at all and more like a dinner party with strangers-you even need to arrive with a bottle or two of wine under your arms. There are two sittings: the first is at the counter where you watch Chef/owner Jake Bickelhaupt and his two colleagues in action; for 8.30 P.M. arrivals, it's the large communal table. For both, you'll be sharing your dinner with people you don't know, but the ice is usually broken by someone asking where their fellow diners have eaten recently. The set menu offers no choice but any allergies are discussed during the bothersome flurry of e-mails that follow the initial impersonal booking process. Then it's over to Jake's smiling wife, Alexa, to guide diners through the parade of dishes. The cooking is clever and contemporary and the ingredients superlative, whether that's the peekytoe crab ""dumpling"" or mojama de atún (air-dried, salt-cured tuna) plated on black slate and perched above a light green pea gelato. Dishes are wonderfully well-balanced and modern techniques are used to great effect to deliver superb flavors. A coffee ""spuma"" flavored with cardamom and whipped cream is an ideal way to cap off this exceptional meal.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60640-42_Grams-438104-41102

What this minuscule spot lacks in size, it makes up for in big and bold flavors. Be mindful of your spice tolerance, as the kitchen is known to turn up the heat. They're not fooling around so don't plan on kissing anyone after sucking on plump Royal Thai prawns topped with a potent mix of minced, fresh garlic, dried red chillies, and fragrant cilantro.

Like the décor, the menu deftly balances comfort and sophistication. A single fresh pasta ribbon folded back and forth becomes lasagna filled with succulent veal osso bucco, fresh baby oregano leaves, and both quark and Parmigiano cheeses tucked within each layer.

Slice into a single large uovo raviolo to mingle poached egg and ricotta with white truffle butter, jalapeño slivers, and chopped chives, or share a crock of Pernod-splashed mussels.

The no-frills, order-at-the-counter spot is simply adorned, with genuinely welcoming service that only adds to the charm. Every spoonful of Luella's andouille and chicken gumbo is one to remember, thanks to a roux that's been cooked for five (count 'em) hours.

The menu, at the moment anyway, is small but packs a big punch-what's available is seasonal, diverse, and extremely fresh. A cold and creamy gold tomato gazpacho features tart strips of roasted eggplant and cool cucumber; while a deconstructed strawberry shortcake arrives in layers of luscious basil caramel and sweet berries.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60625-ampersand_wine_bar-478757-41102
518,La Petite Folie,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Though its tree-lined courtyard off 55th Street may not be as picturesque as the Tuileries, La Petite Folie remains a transporting Gallic hideaway in Hyde Park. The graceful lace-curtained dining room and curvaceous wood bar draws scholarly types from nearby University of Chicago, with prices that satiate student budgets. A retinue of French classics like whole trout Grenobloise are refreshed by seasonal market ingredients at the hands of Chef/co-owner Mary Mastricola. Slices of smoked duck drizzled with black currant vinaigrette get an earthy touch from apple-walnut compote in an elegant lunch salad. Even the wine list chosen by Mastricola's husband Michael is an all-French affair, with numerous by-the-glass choices from Bordeaux to Chablis.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60615-La_Petite_Folie-269211-41102

From the convivial owners and servers, to the bantering patrons getting their fix of Filipino cable TV as they eat, the warmth and love for this Southeast Asian country is clear here. Traditional dishes populate a menu that offers a whirlwind tour of the islands' bold flavors. Tinolang manok, a refreshing take on chicken soup, is redolent with ginger and punctuated by green papaya. Dried taro leaves in laing sa gata lend smokiness to tender, coconut milk-simmered pork and shrimp, and a side of Isla's famous adobo rice, spooned with the classic tart and garlicky pork stew, goes with everything.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60625-Isla-326637-41102

Good standard.","Find an owl, a deer, and a diamond over an unremarkable door on this rather commercial street-these are foodie hieroglyphs for homey yet conceptual Chicago dining. The diminutive interior has only a handful of tables, all surrounding the brightly lit kitchen spectacle. The whitewashed tin ceiling and shelves stocked with everything from Dutch ovens to jars of pickles make it seem like we're all dining in Chef Iliana Regan's cottage-chic underground restaurant. You might even see her refilling your water glass; this is a humble place where dedication trumps attitude. The nightly 17-course menu is a clear treatise on local, organic, and foraged cuisine. Don't be surprised to find bear jerky showcased in the deliciously inventive ""rock course"" that is literally served on a jet-black rock, along with a sticky bite of wild puffed rice mixed with mushroom marshmallow, and topped with Wisconsin cheddar as well as a vibrant pink peppercorn. When the glazed bowl containing a perfectly cooked duck egg and shaved truffles arrives at the table, expect a bit of theatrics as the server explains that the ""twigs"" decorating the table all along are actually fried breadsticks to enjoy with the dish.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60625-Elizabeth-399949-41102

Dine comfortably amid exposed brick walls, steelwork, and shabby-chic furnishings whether seated at the traditional front bar, in the rear, or by the glassed-in kitchen. A great collection of enamel beer signs will put you in the mood for a brew with your Belgian or Thai-style mussels, followed by hearty shavings of porcetta folded into crusty ciabatta with tangy giardinera and creamy mayo. Dinner may flaunt extra variety-but for dessert, fix upon lavender-buttermilk panna cotta crowned with blackberry compote.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60640-Hopleaf-268997-41102

Even the chef himself is at the door welcoming guests to sit and sip a cool, refreshing lassi. From aromatic, homemade curries to tasty twists on dahls (turka dahl ki shabzi is a revelation), everything is fresh and fragrant. Bengali fish curry is a notable attraction-its flavors mild yet lively with mustard seeds, firm and fresh green beans, and silky-sweet onions. A very nice selection of vegetarian dishes might include the veggie samosa: its soft, light shell is stuffed with spiced potatoes, peas, cauliflower, and served with a trio of tangy chutneys.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60625-Paprika-294722-41102

The wee room, so small there's not even a true sushi counter, remains serenely bright but minimal, filled with a handful of white tables and chairs. A limited menu makes the most of shiny pieces of fish. With the majority of nigiri available for less than $3 each, regulars know to load up or go all out with a sashimi platter featuring a wide selection of generously sliced seafood like mackerel, octopus, and maguro with a bowl of rice. Manageably sized, non-gimmicky rolls along with appetizers like pert, crunchy hiyashi wakame salad or spinach with sweet sesame sauce supplement this appealing array.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Chicago-60640-Taketei-410314-41102

Solo diners perch at the 10-seat counter to watch the chefs at work, while groups crowd around tables made from cross-sections of fallen trees, snacking on barbecue chicharrónes or house-made charcuterie. Plates like the mortadella sandwich smeared with olive pesto and stacked with tasso and pancetta further showcase the kitchen's prowess with cured meat.

Inside, dim lighting, dark wood furnishings, and luxuriant fuchsia-red walls create a sophisticated coziness, while servers are gracious and attentive. A simply-named house salad showcases the restaurant's modern, accessible Korean ethos, combining meaty pan-seared portobello strips atop delicately bitter green leaf lettuce, torn sesame leaves, cucumbers, and scallions in a funky garlic-soy sauce. Without tableside barbecue grills, fatty pork slabs are sautéed in the kitchen for sweetly caramelized sam gyup sal.

Simple standard.","Smoque opens for lunch at 11:00 A.M., but a crowd of devotees can be found lining up for a barbecue fix long before then. Once inside, peruse the chalkboard menu, then order cafeteria-style before staking your claim among the communal seating while waiting (and salivating). The half-and-half sandwich, piled with pulled pork and brisket, is the best of both worlds, with chunky shreds of tender pork and spice-rubbed slices of pink-rimmed beef spooned with vinegary barbecue sauce. The usual side dish suspects like zingy, crisp coleslaw and deeply smoky baked beans are anything but standard here, complementing the 'cue as they should.

Good standard.","This understated plate-glass façade may seem lost in a sea of mediocrity, but the restaurant it houses is truly distinct. The soothing décor appears minimal, with splashes of orange banquettes, bare tables, and Rodin replicas to fashion a space that is instantly likeable. Menus are made of planting seed paper that guests are encouraged to take home, soak, and use to grow their own wildflowers. Dishes are intricate and take time for the well-versed staff to describe, which may explain the relatively slow pace of dining here. The nine-course menu showcases noteworthy Chef Chris Nugent's classical edge and contemporary artistry. Start with a plump, butter-poached scallop seared until golden, set in a lobster-rich and coconutty sauce with maitake mushrooms and curry spices, surrounded by edible flower petals placed in gels redolent of lemongrass. This may be followed by a unique egg and shell presentation of black garlic custard dotted with shrimp, tucked with an enticingly sharp sprout purée. Superb cheese and dessert courses are a consistent highlight. Goosefoot is still BYO, but an attached wine shop ensures that no one is caught empty-handed.

Diners make quick work of dishes like toothsome farro and mushroom ""arancini,"" deviled eggs kissed with lemon aïoli, or parmesan-dusted meatballs in a chunky tomato sauce. Crispy skin-on whitefish is paired with buttery potatoes and takes a heavenly swim in caper-lemon sauce.

This is killer Thai, elevated and prepared with care. Herb offers both a three- and six-course prix-fixe dinner at tremendous value, but Chef/owner Patty Neumson's cooking is light (and delicious) enough to go the distance. A sample menu might begin with a cool pile of crunchy green papaya, carrot, and cucumber, laced in a beautifully balanced lime dressing with crispy vermicelli noodles and peanuts. Then move on to tofu and kabocha in a deliciously complex coconut curry full of wilted basil and heat.

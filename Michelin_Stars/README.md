# Michelin Comes to DC
___

Michelin is not just a industry leader for the manufacturing of tires.  They also produce a guide of the worlds most elite and 
exquisite restaurants.  The Michelin Restaurant Guide was originally created to spur traveling (and using tires), but developed into
one of the most prestigious lists on earth.

Earlier this year Michelin announced that they would be releasing a restaurant guide for Washington D.C.  This created quite a buzz and 
many persons started putting together their list of restaurants they believed would make the cut.  

I participated in the General Assembly Data Science Competition for predicting the Michelin Guide.  My process and Finings are in the 
iPython Notebook.

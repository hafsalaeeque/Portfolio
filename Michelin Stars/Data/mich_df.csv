0,Racines NY,French,4,"The American outpost of this popular Parisian original cuts an elegant figure, with its wide marble bar and pristine flower arrangements. Throw in romantic low lighting, brick-lined walls and a tony TriBeCa address-and you have quite the operation. The service can be a bit off-putting, which is a shame because Racines NY has an ace, even affordable, wine list that bears discussion and recommendations. As for the food, you'll pay for all that sexy ambience a little more than the cuisine currently merits-but certain dishes, like a rich chicken liver mousse served with grilled breads, make for an elegant bar snack. Paired with one of those excellent wines by the glass and a seat at that handsome bar, you have a recipe for a glam night on the town.",0,0
1,Little Park,American,2,"Chef/owner Andrew Carmellini strikes again, this time with an inviting all-day eatery on the ground floor of the Smyth Hotel. White tiled walls, amazing artwork, and lovely fresh flowers ensure that the well-designed dining room feels cheery and comfortable. Generous space between tables promises privacy. Local and seasonal ingredients dictate the menu, especially in the raw and cured section-Long Island fluke or Peconic Bay scallops are simple, fresh opening acts. Purple and orange carrots are roasted until tender, topped in crisp breadcrumbs, then beautifully plated with a tangy black garlic aïoli. A burgundy-hued beetroot risotto is studded with goat cheese. Brimming with cuttlefish, clams, and mussels, the spiced shellfish ragù is downright outstanding.",0,0
2,Blaue Gans,Austrian,2,"This sleek, unbridled Viennese-style café feels almost smoky and well-worn, but never out of touch. Its walls are papered with vintage movie posters, while banquettes and tables dominate the dining space. Blaue Gans' strong, loyal following (an increasingly rare feat in the city) is comprised of locals engaging in familiar banter at the bar or communal table. Everyone is here for the impressive Austrian cooking, which may unveil a beautiful bibb, pumpkin seed, and shaved radish salad with a light, creamy pumpkin oil dressing. Other classic treasures include pork Jäger schnitzel with mushrooms, bacon, and herbed spätzle; or classic kavalierspitz accompanied by salty creamed spinach and sweet-tart apple horseradish. Delish desserts will have you at hello.",0,0
3,Rosanjin,Japanese,4,"From its ultra-discrete entrance to its heavily curtained windows, everything about this elegant TriBeCa Japanese restaurant spells delicious rendezvous. Should you be lucky enough to find your way into Rosanjin's barely marked entrance, you'll discover a sleek, sophisticated and oh-so-private dining room with soft jazz music that reads tranquil even when it's full. Despite its tony address and well-heeled clientele, Rosanjin retains a sort of bonhomie from another era-it's not uncommon for the chef to hand-deliver a few of your dishes with a heartfelt thank you. It's a gesture of gratitude you're likely to return after witnessing the stunning composition on your plate. A typical kaiseki meal here would feature a bright selection of sushi, some of it scored to deliver that perfect melt-in-your-mouth experience; and might include a delicate (and dramatic) starter of lobster and uni, suspended in a jellied dashi broth and served in a glass with a wispy cloud of orange dry ice. Then, an excellent chawan mushi may follow, with salty caviar, tender oyster mushrooms, fresh uni, and chives; or a delicious clear soup with a scallop mousse dumpling, mountain yam, mountain greens, and ginger.",1,1
4,Brushstroke,Japanese,4,"The name may not give too much away but as soon as you enter you just know you're in a Japanese restaurant. It's probably all that calming wood-there's enough here of assorted hues and from various sources to excite the woodsman in us all. Or it could be the L-shaped counter behind which chefs go about their work with studied determination; or more probably, it's the sight of graciously polite servers carrying bowls, boards, and cups containing delicate dishes of infinite beauty. This joint venture between David Bouley and Yoshiki Tsuji aims to showcase the beauty, subtlety, harmony, and precision that is Japanese cuisine. This isn't the place for sushi-you go next door for that. Instead, it serves seasonally pertinent dishes that are a joy to behold, but where the art never comes at the expense of taste. The Washu beef sukiyaki, for example, has a wonderful depth of flavor. Desserts, such as sake crème brûlée, have more obvious European parentage but are still light, delicate creations. Indeed, such is the nature of the food here that one can, unlike with many styles of restaurant, still engage in constructive work afterwards.",1,1
5,Tiny's,American,2,"The name says it all-Tiny's is indeed tiny, but in that old New York, wood-burning fire and pressed-tin ceiling kind of way. Enter the narrow Federal-style home (c. 1810) and sidle up to the beautiful people along the pew seats overlooking a poster of the Marlboro Man, or head on to the aptly named Bar Upstairs. The food may be American but seamlessly weaves in Italian influences. Creamy burrata arrives over date purée, glazed in lemon-honey and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Hake is thickly cut and enticingly flaky, drizzled in brown butter with tart capers, lemon, and parsley, then complemented with both pan-roasted fingerling potatoes and beautifully dressed frisée salad. Even their delicate California chardonnay harkens to old-world flavors.",0,0
6,The Odeon,American,3,"It's easy to see why The Odeon has been a part of the fabric of TriBeCa life for so long. Like watching a re-run of Seinfeld, it is reassuringly familiar, classically New York and, even when you know what's coming next, still eminently satisfying. The menu is a roll-call of everyone's favorites, from chicken paillard to beet salad, burgers to cheesecake. Cocktails are well made and beers carefully poured. Dishes are executed with sufficient care and portions are of manageable proportions. The room comes with an appealing art deco feel and the terrace at the front pulls in the occasional passer-by. Service is personable and willing too, although after all this time the place could probably run itself.",0,0
7,Marc Forgione,American,3,"This eponymous restaurant is dark, sexy, and attracts an endless stream of downtown denizens. Abundant candles produce more atmosphere than light for the rustic room clad in exposed brick and salvaged wood. Aloof servers dressed in black seem to disappear into the background. The innovative American fare excites with bold flavors, as in barbecued oysters sprinkled with pancetta powder. Montauk fluke en croute, set over roasted cauliflower, hazelnuts, and capers topped with a buttery panel of toast, is dressed with sauce proposal-so named because the rich brown butter and golden raisin emulsion is said to have earned the chef a few romantic offers. It is delicious, but Chef Forgione deserves equal affection for those amazing butter-glazed potato rolls.",0,0
8,atera,Contemporary,4,"Well, hello there, Ronny Emborg-this visionary new culinary talent takes the reigns at Jodi Richard's sleek TriBeCa tasting menu restaurant, atera-and the results are nothing short of sublime. Guests access atera by an ultra-discreet entrance; from there, a polished and attentive staff member might offer you a complimentary drink before whisking you off to a lovely, U-shaped counter with supple leather seats positioned to watch the kitchen execute its magic. Sound like a beautiful dream? It is wonderfully real, and that's before they ply you with their excellent wine pairing, cocktails or tea tasting (yes, tea-trust us, you'll be talking about it for days). Chef Emborg's Danish-accented menu might begin with an exquisite chilled green tomato soup with juniper oil, before proceeding to a buttery waffle with savory mushroom cream and earthy black truffle. Then, tender snow crab in an ethereal tomato broth with rose hip cream; or sweet scallop with crisp green apple, dill fronds and horseradish ice may be tailed by springy sepia plated with tart currants and laced with a deadly delicious hazelnut fish cream. Plump razor clams in a miso-brown butter broth are topped with bitter greens and foam for added flavor.",2,1
9,Ichimura,Japanese,4,"Tucked away in the bustling swirl of TriBeCa, Ichimura is an oasis of tranquility-with a bright, sun-drenched wood décor that effortlessly blends minimalist Japanese style with a modern sensibility. It's the perfect space to take a seat at the L-shaped counter, take a deep breath, and let go of that city angst. Then, give yourself over completely to the genius Chef Eiji Ichimura and his talented waitstaff. Throughout your omakase experience, Chef Ichimura always handles the service himself-first bending over his heart-stopping creations and shaping dishes with fingers as nimble as a cellist's, then delivering it with a gracious smile. Dinner might begin with the traditional zensai, or appetizer plate of cold bites; and then move on to dishes like a warm, excellent chawan mushi topped with Florida golden crab, truffle dashi, and confetti of chopped chives. A plate of superbly fresh and seasonal sashimi, some of it expertly cured or carrying a drop of delicious sauce, may be tailed by a mind-blowing parade of bright sushi that might include hiramasa, king mackerel, Japanese ocean trout, Flying fish, sea perch, or the creamiest ebi you've ever tasted, carrying a whisper of shiso and Japanese uni.",2,1
10,Khe-Yo,Asian,2,"This Laotian hot spot serves up vibrant family-style plates brimming with tart and spicy notes that pack a punch-make that a Bang Bang, actually, as in the house sauce of mixed chilies, cilantro, fish sauce, and garlic served to diners as a welcome along with a basket of sticky rice. The food is worth braving the wait and decibel levels, so sip a craft brew or cocktail before digging in. Start with a plate of wide rice noodles and bits of slow-cooked pork in a coconut-rich yellow curry garnished with herbs, bean sprouts, and slivered banana blossom. Banana leaf-steamed red snapper is another beautifully prepared item, served with crisped artichoke hearts, Chinese broccoli, and more of that sauce. Bright and bitter grapefruit sorbet is a fitting finish.",0,0
11,Bouley,French,4,"Even from the outside, Bouley hints at the certain level of luxury that every successful TriBeCa restaurant strives to attain. Here, it begins with an industrial façade, high arches, exposed brick, and oversized windows dressed in silk. Inside, hand-painted wallpaper, bold watercolors, and a generous floral budget make for an operatic setting reminiscent of a château-maybe the same one from which they salvaged the floors (literally). An undeniable formality keeps the varied clientele muted but never hushed. The ambience may seem a bit old school, yet the cooking mixes tradition with modernity. Meals may start with a fresh, earthy mix of wild mushrooms with sweet garlic, subtle seasoning, and grilled toro that brings unexpected dimension to the dish. Slightly smoky Alaskan salmon with corn sauce and hearts of palm is almost overshadowed by the superlative pomme purée that is buttery yet retains its pronounced potato flavor. But, remember to pace yourself as Bouley pushes one of the most serious carb chariots in town-think death by bread. Finish with an amaretto flan piped with white chocolate, caramelized banana, and silky-smooth maple and amaretto ice cream. It's delicious and never disappoints.",1,1
12,Landmarc,Mediterranean,2,"Chef/owner Marc Murphy's Landmarc is the TriBeCa destination for meeting friends over casual drinks and food that happens to be rib-sticking delicious. Downstairs, the bi-level space showcases thick steel cables suspending industrial art and a horseshoe bar flanking a large cooking fire that warms the soul and sizzles those lamb chops. The upstairs is more serene. Meals may start with lighter plates of smoky and blistered shishito peppers flecked with crunchy sea salt. Then, move on to deeply satisfying (and reasonably priced) nightly pasta specials, like thick and buttery spaghetti alla Bolognese. ""Landmarc classic"" cheese plates are a reliable highlight. Miniature desserts mean that there is always room for a lemon-custard tart (or four).",0,0
13,Zutto,Asian,2,"Exposed filament bulbs and a red brick wall give this cozy Japanese pub an inviting, industrial feel. There is a communal wood table for groups, small sushi bar, and long wall of banquettes and tables topped with linen napkins cleverly folded, origami-style. Service is eager, efficient, and less concerned with the flow of a leisurely meal. Unlike many Japanese restaurants with one specialty, this izakaya's diverse menu includes bar snacks, sushi, steamed buns, and ramen. Tangy, spicy buffalo cauliflower is a playful take on wings, replacing chicken with bright orange chunks of deep-fried cauliflower tempered by cool, creamy ranch sauce. The Zutto fried rice is another ideal drinking accompaniment, peppered with kimchi and pastrami beneath a runny egg.",0,0
14,Jungsik,Korean,4,"Cool, chic, and completely urbane, Jungsik is the epitome of contemporary elegance. Inside the large, neatly partitioned space, find rich browns and ivory furnishings with flattering lighting that is just bright enough to see your food clearly. The chairs are deep and tables are well spaced, but request a plush corner banquette for maximum comfort. Even the place settings show sculptural beauty through dark pottery and white porcelain. The ambience is fairly quiet and somewhat reflective. The modern cuisine is confident, complex, and happens to be leaning much more toward Europe than Korea of late. No matter-the cooking remains profoundly enjoyable. At the same time, the most inspired dishes are the ones that retain their heritage, as in the dome of seaweed-seasoned rice with cubes of smoked and torched yellowtail, finished with slivered lettuce. Before the crispy red snapper arrives at the table, hot oil is poured overtop to cook the fish but also to yield incredibly crisped skin, served with a brunoise of hearty greens and potatoes and rich perilla vinaigrette. Artful desserts include black raspberry and coconut sorbet with crumbles of spinach cake, yuzu meringue, and perfect berry slices.",2,1
15,Tamarind,Indian,3,"Building Tamarind cost a cool five million, and it shows-every inch of this soaring space oozes with grandeur. With its classic TriBeCa edifice and gorgeous marble bar (an ideal perch for post-work indulgence), the glass-fronted behemoth draws a posh crowd of Wall Streeters and well-heeled locals. Most impressive of all is the sleek display kitchen, outfitted with a gleaming tandoor that turns out exceptional Mughlai food like nawab shami kabab (lamb patties seasoned with ginger) and hara bhara kabab (pearl-white paneer mingled with bright emerald-green spinach). While service is mediocre at best and the kitchen may fall behind at peak times, mains like kolambi pola (prawns in a coconut-and-chili curry) make up for any gaffes and guarantee a return visit.",0,0
16,MarkJoseph,Steakhouse,3,"This smart and sleek steak haven continues to claim its rightful place among the faithful haunts of area residents, business types, and carnivores in town. Handsome in its dark wood-paneled glory, with a wine cellar display and white tablecloths, this traditional den exudes a clubby Wall Street scene. Expect to see a crowd of suits discussing stocks, shares, and sports scores, of course. The quality of USDA Prime beef is paramount here, but the culinary technique is just another reason why this steakhouse succeeds. Steaks are perfect medium rare, brushed with sweet melting fat, seasoned with salt, and perhaps served with a gravy boat of béarnaise sauce. Finish off with a classic slice of pecan pie topped with swirls of whipped cream.",0,0
17,Bâtard,Contemporary,3,"239 West Broadway will be a familiar address to those who know their restaurants as it has hosted a number of seminal establishments over the years-namely Montrachet and Corton. Drew Nieporent's Bâtard restaurant is now firmly in situ and once again we have a talented chef making waves in TriBeCa. Chef Markus Glocker's cooking is very precise and his dishes look quite delicate on the plate. But like a good featherweight they pack more of a punch than you're expecting. You'll even notice his Austrian roots in evidence in some of the dishes, such as short rib and tafelspitz terrine, or the Granny Smith and sweetbread strudel. The room is comfortable and neat and the atmosphere grown-up yet animated. When it comes to service though, it appears that the restaurant has mistaken informality for indifference as it lacks coordination or direction. So you may need to remind yourself that you're here primarily for the food. But that food is very good indeed.",1,1
18,Peking Duck House,Chinese,2,"It's worth your while to wend through Chinatown's teeming sidewalks to delight in the eponymous house specialty here. Once inside, however crowded, the neutral-toned interior adds a calming effect to the many tables gearing up for their bird's arrival, and the mode of transport is a linen-draped cart.The duck is deftly carved and dramatically served by the chef himself, so push in your chair and prepare for a festive DIY feast of warm, soft pancakes, cool cucumbers, scallions, and sweet hoisin. Although the duck is what makes this a destination, there are several other entrées like sizzling sliced beef with scallops; and live lobster with ginger and scallions. To begin, the clear golden broth of the duck wonton soup is an appropriate prelude to the main event.",0,0
19,North End Grill,American,3,"Its contemporary look features that same stunning combination of white umbrella-like fixtures, black-stained walls, and midnight blue banquettes. However, the reigning chef in the open kitchen reveals a menu shift towards grilled foods, updated comfort favorites, and charcuterie. Start with an artfully arranged terrine layering strips of pig's ear topped with green beans and mustard vinaigrette. The flavors of wood infuse every element of a thick, blistered pizza decked with potatoes, pancetta, sweet onions, and gently poached eggs. French sensibilities shine in the simply grilled Colorado lamb chops with ribbons of zucchini, baby leeks, and carrots. For dessert, the creamsicle pie bursts with the taste of candied orange, whipped cream, and childhood.",0,0
20,Tribeca Grill,Contemporary,3,"Beckoning business titans day and night, this corner restaurant is a destination for its big, bright dining room with well-spaced tables. Wall-to-wall windows overlook two quintessential TriBeCa streets, while exposed brick, moody artwork, and a spectacular bar smack in the center of the room complete the refined vibe. Gigantone, large tubular pasta loaded with a braised short rib Bolognese beneath a dollop of fresh sheep's milk ricotta, makes a rich start to a meal. The decadence continues with seared scallops over creamy carrot risotto, topped with a truffled-Madeira vinaigrette, and brought over the top with a few fragrant shavings of black truffle. Desserts are as classic as the space; try the banana tart with malted chocolate and pecan ice cream.",0,0
21,Nom Wah Tea Parlor,Chinese,1,"Even after a renovation, this ""parlor"" continues to thrive as a retro dive replete with truly awful service. But keep reading, because the supremely delicious food and unreal value more than make up for Nom Wah's many flaws.Dim sum is the main draw at this busy neighborhood diner, where small groups fill the dining counter and pack into pleather booths for the likes of pan-fried dumplings stuffed with ground pork and sweet shrimp. Scallion pancakes flaunt outstanding texture; fried shrimp wrapped in bean curd unites top product with heavenly flavor; and noodles sautéed with superior soy is a salt fiends dream. Bring hungry friends and expect lots of leftovers, because the simple pleasures here have been known to thrill even the most ardent epicurean.",0,0
22,Bo Ky,Chinese,1,"If you're drawn to those bare bones sort of places where food quality, beyond-warm service, and value speak for itself, this is your Chinatown slam dunk. Bo Ky's steamed-up windows (from the succulent meats roasting inside) are an invitation to come in and get cracking on a perfect bowl of wonton and noodle soup.Crispy skinned and exquisitely juicy chicken drizzled with dark soy and served beside chili-studded nuoc cham may be the closet local sib to the Hong Kong classic, presented here with a Vietnamese touch. Its textural interplay is as first-rate as the house specialty itself- a crispy fried shrimp-and-scallion roll wrapped in bean curd skin. Spice fiends can turn up the heat at home-their secret-recipe addictive sauces are for sale by the jar!",0,0
23,Thái Soŉ,Vietnamese,1,"Thái So'n is by far the best of the bunch in this Vietnamese quarter of Chinatown. It's neither massive nor fancy, but it's bright, clean, and perpetually in business. One peek at the specials on the walls (maybe golden-fried squid strewn with sea salt) will have you begging for a seat in the crammed room.Speedy servers scoot between groups of City Hall suits and Asian locals as they order the likes of cha gio, pork spring rolls with nuoc cham; or goi cuon, fantastic summer rolls filled with poached shrimp and vermicelli. Naturally, pho choices are abundant, but the real star of the show is pho tai-where raw beef shavings are cooked to tender perfection when combined with a scalding hot, savory broth replete with herbs, sprouts, and chewy noodles.",0,0
24,Macao Trading Co.,Asian,3,"Droves of curious downtowners continue their love affair with this cushy mainstay for Macanese cuisine. With nothing but a red light over a dark door to mark its entrance, make your way into this bi-level beauty, accoutered with heavy velvet drapes, double-height ceilings, and a dimly lit yet sexy bar. The mien is playful, buzz palpable, and first-rate drinks are flowing. Start with the Tuscan kale-and-romaine salad, enticingly smoky with texturally perfect potato ""croutons"" and paprika vinaigrette. Then, move on to a Taipa steamboat (cross between a Chinese hotpot and Portuguese paella) teeming with briny shellfish, fried chicken wings, and linguiça. Sample a slice of their chocolate diablo cake for an indulgent and notably decadent finish.",0,0
25,Xe Lua,Vietnamese,1,"Fantastic food is the sole focus of this Vietnamese dive. The décor-albeit stark-highlights a semi-tropical theme and the crowd might be touristy, but don't let that deter you as the food is wonderfully authentic and very reasonable.Condiments atop each table serve to enhance even the most humble goi cuon stuffed with grilled pork and vermicelli. Muc chien don is a plate of chewy, crisped squid tossed in salt, pepper, and tailed by cucumbers and red onion for ample tang; while the house special pho xe lua reveals a rich, savory broth full of noodles, brisket, and beef tendon. Combine this with sprouts, chilies, and herbs for a surefire delight.Enjoy dessert with a Vietnamese iced coffee that will give even your great-aunt Grace the shakes.",0,0
26,Locanda Verde,Italian,3,"This ever-trendy yet refined Italian ristorante is as much coveted for its gorgeous setting as its lineup of rustic, tasty fare. The ambience is always abuzz and everyone looks beautiful amid low lights, a long bar, and walls adorned with wine bottles. Breakfast verges on divine-think lemon pancakes and apple-cider donuts. Bare tables are packed throughout the day with a stylish crowd waxing poetic about crostini topped with blue crab and jalapeño. Also try terrific house-made pasta such as pappardelle with lamb Bolognese finished with a dollop of sheep's milk ricotta, or paccheri dressed in ""Sunday night ragù."" No one should leave without sampling superb sweets, like the apple and concord grape crostata with rosemary hazelnut brittle and brown butter gelato.",0,0
27,Dim Sum Go Go,Chinese,2,"This wildly popular dim sum joint is still packed to the gills most days, and for good reason: the Cantonese fare and dim sum served up at this bright, contemporary spot is as good as the food you'll find trekking out to those super-authentic places in far-flung Queens. Even better, they take reservations-and dim sum orders are taken by the staff as opposed to rolled around on the traditional cart, helping ensure the food stays super fresh.If the price seems a bit higher than its competitors, you'll find it's worth it for dishes like sweet shrimp, rolled in rice paper and laced with dark soy sauce; plump snow pea leaf dumplings spiked with vibrant ginger and garlic; rich, tender duck dumplings; or an irresistibly flaky baked roast pork pie.",0,0
28,Trading Post,American,2,"A reprieve from the neighborhood's many pubs and quick-serve joints, this popular restaurant occupies three floors of a historic building across from the Rockwell-designed Imagination Playground. Stylish and eclectic with a maritime theme, the massive space boasts a rollicking bar and whiskey cellar plus an upscale second floor with water views and an elegant library. The menu is just as wonderful and wide-ranging, with everything from flatbreads to skirt steak to lobster fried rice. Highlights include a healthy and delicious quinoa salad, studded with butternut squash, morsels of creamy feta, dried cranberries, and a drizzle of reduced balsamic vinegar. Jumbo shrimp plated with wilted kale, plump butter beans, and braised tomato is an impressive entrée.",0,0
29,A-Wah,Chinese,1,"An incredibly popular member of NYC's diverse culinary scene, simple, tiny, and singularly focused A-Wah fires up a vast array of Hong Kong-style comfort foods from ginger chicken feet to sautéed pea leaves. The region's tasty take on lo mein is a total departure from the familiar version. Here, find a platter of thin noodles topped with pork or duck, served with a side of delicate, consommé-like broth for dipping.However, the biggest treat is the fantastic bo zai fan: rice cooked to crunchy perfection in a clay pot and crowned with ginger, scallions, and a mind-boggling choice of seventeen toppings like frog, pork, and preserved vegetables. These dishes and their tasty burnt-rice sides are made even better with a thick and sweet house-made soy sauce.",0,0
30,Golden Unicorn,Chinese,2,"This age-old dim sum parlor, spread over many floors in an office building, is one of the few Cantonese spots that actually has the space and volume to necessitate its parade of steaming carts brimming with treats. While Golden Unicorn's system is very efficient and part of the spectacle, arrive early to nab a seat by the kitchen for better variety and hotter items.A helpful brigade of suited men and women roam the space to offer the likes of exquisitely soft roast pork buns, or congee with preserved egg and shredded pork. Buzzing with locals and visitors, it is also a favorite among families who appreciate the kid-friendly scene as much as the delectable, steamed pea shoot and shrimp dumplings, pork siu mai, and rice rolls stuffed with shrimp.",0,0
31,Great N.Y. Noodletown,Chinese,1,"When heading to Great N.Y. Noodletown, invite plenty of dining companions to share those heaping plates of roasted meats and rice and noodle soups served at this bargain favorite. Locals stream in until the 4:00 A.M. closing bell for their great Cantonese fare-food is clearly the focus here, over the brusque service and unfussy atmosphere. Guests' gazes quickly pass over the imitation wooden chairs to rest on the crispy skin of suckling pig and ducks hanging in the window.These dishes are huge, so forgo the rice and opt instead for deliciously chewy noodles and barbecue meats. Incredible shrimp wontons, so delicate and thin, and the complex, homemade e-fu noodles demonstrate technique and quality to a standout level that is rarely rivaled.",0,0
32,Oriental Garden,Chinese,2,"A daily destination for dim sum, Oriental Garden is a treasure among tourists, foodies, and wealthy Chinese residents.

33,New Malaysia,Malaysian,1,"Mad for Malaysian? Head to this lively dive, sequestered in a Chinatown arcade. Proffering some of the best Malaysian treats in town, including all the classics, New Malaysia sees a deluge of regulars who pour in for a massive offering of exceptional dishes. Round tables cram a room furnished with little more than a service counter. Still, the aromas wafting from flaky roti canai and Melaka crispy coconut shrimp keep you focused on the food.Capturing the essence of this region are brusque servers who speedily deliver abundant and authentic bowls of spicy-sour asam laksa fragrant with lemongrass; kang-kung belacan, greens with dried shrimp and chili; and nasi lemak, the national treasure starring coconut rice, chicken curry, and dried anchovies.",0,0
34,Il Cortile,Italian,2,"Beyond this quaint and charming façade lies one of Little Italy's famed mainstays, ever-popular with dreamy eyed dates seeking the stuff of Billy Joel lyrics. The expansive space does indeed suggest a nostalgic romance, with its series of Mediterranean-themed rooms, though the most celebrated is the pleasant garden atrium (il cortile is Italian for courtyard), with a glass-paneled ceiling and abundant greenery.A skilled line of chefs present a wide array of familiar starters and entrées, from eggplant rollatini to chicken Francese; as well as a range of pastas, such as spaghettini puttanesca or risotto con funghi. Several decades of sharing family recipes and bringing men to one bent knee continues to earn Il Cortile a longtime following.",0,0
35,Royal Seafood,Chinese,1,"Bright, chaotic, and jam-packed with a multi-generational Chinese crowd, this well-priced favorite has dim sum lovers lined up and waiting in droves.

36,Grand Harmony,Chinese,1,"With every seat filled before noon and dim sum carts roaming the sea of famished diners, Grand Harmony's expansive but rather run-down hall echoes the commotion of Chinatown. Naturally, they must be doing something right, so snag a seat upon arrival and flag those nimble women as they direct their carts through the labyrinth of tables.Resting upon these coveted carts is a plethora of solid dim sum. Friendly servers parade the likes of beautifully crisp bean curd skin stuffed with vegetables, shrimp, and pork; congee studded with bits of dried fish and scallions; and juicy shrimp and chive dumplings all at an unbelievably good price.

37,Shanghai Heping,Chinese,2,"When faced with the long, no-frills menu, there should read a caution sign to not miss out on the crab and pork soup dumplings. The juicy filling and flavorful broth held in each delicate wrapper with soy-ginger seasoning explain the afternoon crowd lunching out of takeout boxes on the entrance in.Large bamboo steamer baskets line most tables, and the seared pan-fried pork dumplings are not to miss either. Cold appetizers shine like dark soy- and sugar-cooked bamboo shoots with wheat gluten; and thinly-sliced, earthy stir-fried eel with chives. There are larger, steaming hot plates to choose from like Shanghai rice cakes with beef. The sweet ""Eight Jewel Rice"" dessert matches a mound of sticky rice with red bean paste, red dates, and golden raisin ""jewels.""",0,0
38,Harry's Cafe & Steak,American,2,"Nestled beneath the historic Hanover building, Harry's presents two distinct experiences. The casual Cafe and bar stand at the entrance, packed wall to wall with Wall Street suits haunting their local watering hole. Dining here is both cozy and communal, in an atmosphere that promises a fun time. Harry's Steak sits behind the Cafe, with its own bar and a series of snug rooms for a more intimate evening. Begin with a classic starter, like mushrooms stuffed with sweet, succulent lobster; but everyone really comes for the steak. Here, a prime hanger steak is perfectly seared, juicy, and tender-impressive for this particular cut-served with homemade béarnaise. There is no room left for disappointment, but maybe enough for the pecan bread pudding.",0,0
39,Shanghai Café,Chinese,1,"This quirky café is a Chinatown stalwart. Busy booths line one wall, while big round tables are popular for gathering families. Note the dumpling station upfront, where agile chefs assemble these mouthwatering parcels.Regulars know to arrive early for lunch to make the most of their vast menu, appetizing to vegetarians and omnivores alike. Servers are remarkably capable, balancing trays of addictive steamed juicy buns and cold dried bean curd, or soft rice cakes stir-fried with chicken and shrimp. The ""queen"" mushroom is sized for a king; its thick slices cooked until tender and bathed in an umami-rich brown sauce. The salty pork slices and fresh, crunchy bamboo shoots arrive in a broth so nourishing that you will slurp to the last drop.",0,0
40,Parigot,French,2,"Parigot is a trés charming bistro on (now mega trendy) Grand Street. Owned and operated by Chef Michel Pombet and partner, Catherine Amsellem, the French cooking is classic yet fine-tuned for its downtown crowd. However, the warm, time-worn décor stays true to its roots. Tables are topped with paper and crayons to entertain the kids in tow.Service is adept, and locals seem to feel their joie de vivre as the place is always abuzz. The vast, straightforward, and hearty menu is an equal draw with exquisitely rich onion soup bobbing beneath sliced croûtes and melted cheese. The superb duck confit is set over a sautéed mushrooms, haricot verts, and salsify. Pâté is wonderously pork-y, rich, perfectly seasoned, and paired with grilled country bread.",0,0
41,Malaysian Kitchen,Malaysian,2,"New York Harbor views aren't always accompanied by delicious cooking, but this airy restaurant offers just that on one of the best promenades in Battery Park City. Walls of the dining room are draped with vivid scenes of life in Malaysia, while tables overlook the Statue of Liberty as well as boats that glide by on the Hudson River. Skip the fusion items and stick to the robust Malaysian specialties. Flavorful renditions of classics include nasi lemak with coconut-perfumed rice, and roti canai, a flaky, elastic, fluffy bread with potato and chicken curry for dipping. Fork-tender and sensationally thick beef rendang-simmered in coconut milk, lemongrass, lime leaves, and fermented fish sauce-is pure slow-cooked comfort, served with a hefty portion of rice on the side.",0,0
42,Papatzul,Mexican,2,"Sangria and salsas rule at Papatzul, a swanky SoHo scene rife with a classically trained chef churning out delightful Mexican cuisine. On any given evening, the cozy and narrow space, decorated with masks and dark wood, is abuzz with drinking buddies getting friendly with tequila offerings and tables of friends diving into five types of salsas-each inspired by a different region in Mexico. Great care is given to each dish, like chicken flautas made with some of the city's best tortillas, and filled with tender grilled meat, and a dab of salsa borracha. For a regal repast, try slow-roasted duck enchiladas featuring a rich, almond-chili mole. It rises well above the neighborhood norm, making this spot quite the destination for margarita-fueled fun.",0,0
43,Antique Garage,Turkish,2,"Bohemian-chic Antique Garage makes for a perfectly discreet rendezvous. Complete with high ceilings and the beat-up bones of a former garage, this sultry spot combines vintage furniture, pendant-like chandeliers, and mirrors galore to create the quintessentially cool hangout. Insanely talented jazz musicians jam in the corner, while gin martinis and Turkish white wines flow as freely as the conversation. Ottoman cuisine rules here with well-made, welcoming, and wonderful bites-after hitting SoHo's boutiques and galleries, those bowls of spicy olives are the ideal snack for sharing. For heartier fare, try a grilled halloumi salad tossed with briny artichoke hearts, or smoky lamb shish kabobs, traditional in presentation and deeply satisfying in flavor.",0,0
44,Nebraska Steakhouse,Steakhouse,3,"Marked by a relatively modest and discreet façade, Nebraska Steakhouse remains a well-tread fixture in the FiDi. This classic watering hole with equally brazen diners hovering around a tiny, narrow, and well-soaked bar evokes that old-timey city tavern scene. Inside, the vibe is lively, drinks are strong, and their appetizing offerings are expertly handled. Finding the door isn't a cakewalk and manipulating the crowd takes some negotiating, but rest assured that the end result is worth it. Yes, those steaks are on-point, but smoked trout salad followed by 22-ounces of tender and juicy grilled lamb Porterhouse chops never fails to sate. In contrast with the gruff service, a pecan pie studded with chocolate chips and heavy cream is so sweet.",0,0
45,Daruma-ya Soba,Japanese,2,"Known for sensational soba and expert execution, Chef Shuichi Kotani crafts his renowned buckwheat noodles every 30 minutes, cooks them in a mere 20 seconds, and offers an experience as authentic as any you'd find in Japan. Cozy up in a round leather booth in the clubby front area, or take a seat in the more elegant wood and stone dining room. To truly understand the elasticity, texture, nutty flavors, and the precision that goes into hand-cutting each strand, go for the purest expression of the complex noodles-served in a simple, delicate dashi with scallions, alongside green vegetables and takuan (Japanese yellow pickled daikon). Also explore small plates like fishcake with shiso and wasabi, sushi offerings, or the fixed dinner menu.",0,0
46,Sushi Azabu,Japanese,4,"Like a little secret tucked beneath Daruma-ya, this standout sushi den has a serene look and private feel that is intimacy incarnate. This works out well, since the subterranean room can only seat about a dozen guests. The changing roster of Japanese chefs maintain their mystical composure beneath the dark painting of a carp behind the counter, fostering a relaxed pace to each meal even as orders pile in from upstairs. True, they may be serving the same quality fish as the spot above, but the omakase dishes here are incomparably superior. This is immediately clear from the first bit of otoshi, house-made silken tofu with the bold flavors of sea urchin and salmon roe, finished with bits of crisped nori. The kitchen's seasonal influences may be reflected in a springtime bowl of bamboo shoots braised in smoky dashi, or a delicate cube of steamed Japanese red snapper in soy-ginger broth with grated turnip and a fragrant, bright green cherry leaf. The array of sushi includes an explosively briny giant clam, sea scallop with grated yuzu on perfectly cooked rice, and raw sweet shrimp that is downright knee-weakening. The miso soup is the best you've had in a long time.",1,1
47,Nyonya,Malaysian,2,"Nyonya prides itself with a comfortable setting composed of brick walls and wood tables, but everyone's really here for their food, which is always on the money. Adept servers are eager to steer you through the varied menu-and sometimes even away from such delicious dishes as asam laksa, an exceptionally spiced and intensely sour broth floating with lemongrass, ground fish, and thick, round noodles.Asians and other hungry locals pack this haunt for seemingly simple yet deeply satisfying items like achat (pickled vegetables tossed with turmeric and peanuts); mee siam (noodles stir-fried with tofu, eggs, and shrimp in a chili sauce); or pungent beef rendang. Crispy prawns garnished with curry-infused toasted coconut are nothing short of wow!",0,0
48,Inatteso Pizzabar Casano,Italian,2,"Manhattan has no shortage of pizza. But shockingly, the touristy, banker-packed Battery Park City lacked a proper wood-fired pizza until the arrival of Inatteso. Tucked away, it features stunning views of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island from the south end of the bar. Any seat in the brightly lit, wood-paneled room provides a glimpse of the oven and scents of a blistering crust. The 12-inch Margherita expresses pure pizza-making skill through soft, fluffy dough with a touch of semolina and knobs of fior di latte. It's not entirely traditional but completely enjoyable. The menu doesn't stop at pizza, and neither should you. Sample pasta like orechiette with broccoli rabe and pan-roasted mahi mahi with sweet and sour eggplant caponata.",0,0
49,Brinkley's,Gastropub,2,"Brinkley's seems to be the provincial ""pub"" for everyone from students and hipsters to executives looking for a thirst quencher and bite after work. This easy and informal spot wears a boho-chic look with metallic stools lining a zinc-topped bar, a black-and-white checked floor, and burgundy leather booths. The team fits the casual, neighborhood feel of its vibrant yet rather noisy surroundings.Find such straightforward delights as a grilled chicken salad with walnuts, grapes, and red onion in a shallot vinaigrette. Then, move on to a deliciously crusty lobster club filled with bacon and avocado, served with sweet potato fries. A taste of their moist bread pudding topped with whipped cream will ensure some very simple, homespun bliss.",0,0
50,The Greek,Greek,2,"This upscale ouzerie and taverna is a cozy den of Greek hospitality. Beyond the slender mahogany bar and mounted wine barrels, the rustic-chic dining room is meticulously decorated with vine-wrapped columns to echo the wine-centric theme as well as plush sofas for sinking into the very relaxed vibe. The long bar is a lovely perch for the solo diner craving chicken souvlaki or just an afternoon frappé. Begin with keftedes, tender beef meatballs slowly simmered in aromatic tomato sauce and topped with crumbled aged feta. Then move on to a thick yellow split pea purée folded with olive oil, capers, and bright lemon juice. The mousaka is bubbling perfection layered with potato, grilled eggplant, zucchini, and beef topped with eggy-buttery béchamel.",0,0
51,La Esquina,Mexican,2,"When La Esquina opened it was a breath of bright air, offering enjoyably fresh cuisine that stood tall among the paltry selection of Manhattan Mexican. Thankfully, the city's south-of-the-border dining scene has evolved since then. However, La Esquina remains a fun and worthy option. More playground than restaurant, this multi-faceted setting takes up an iconic downtown corner and draws a hip crowd to the grab and go taqueria, 30-seat café, and lively subterranean dining room and bar.The spirit here is not just alive but kicking with classic renditions of tortilla soup; mole negro enchiladas filled with excellently seasoned chicken; as well the likes of carne asada starring black Angus sirloin with mojo de ajo.",0,0
52,Pier A,American,3,"Situated on a pier off the Hudson River, this three-story Victorian-a rambunctious New York landmark replete with a prominent clock tower and enormous promenade-is hardly your average watering hole. After all, where else can you slurp bivalves and sip craft beers among pressure gauges from 19th century steamships while taking in a view of the Statue of Liberty? The menu's tempting seafood options include a dozen types of fresh, plump oysters; lobster mac and cheese studded with greens and bacon and served in a cast iron skillet; as well as mini lobster rolls with a citrusy remoulade. While the fare here begs for brews, grown-ups craving quiet conversation, a proper martini, and an ultra-hearty Tomahawk steak should head upstairs to Pier A Harborhouse.",0,0
53,Sessanta,Italian,3,"Restaurateur John McDonald's newest venture finds him mining the unique flavors of Sicily, with the oh-so-talented Chef Jordan Frosolone helming the kitchen. Located in the SIXTY SoHo, Sessanta's mid-century Italian décor boasts vintage chandeliers, wood paneling, and a warm, earthy palette. The overall effect is retro, urban, and gorgeous. So does the food hold up to the setting? Terrifically, for Chef Frosolone has a knack for sourcing ingredients and a memory for Sicilian flavors. Must-try dishes include near-perfect caponata with pignoli, vincotto, basil, and silky potato; sashimi-grade crudo di tonno with tart lime, zucchini ribbons, and caperberries; or busiate tossed with ruby-red shrimp, green zucchini, and pomodori di Pachino.",0,0
54,Bacchanal,Contemporary,2,"When you name your restaurant Bacchanal your customers can reasonably expect a decent bar-and here it's the centre of attention. The place is also suitably dark and moody, but it's not so much ""distressed"" as ""mildly neurotic"" because next to the bar is an open kitchen vying for your attention. It's a moot point as to whether this is a bar with a bistro attached or a bistro with a great bar; even those running it can't decide because the volume of the music goes up and down like a fiddler's elbow.In the meantime, the kitchen keeps things fairly simple and does them well enough. Along with dishes from the grill like whole daurade, expect offerings like fresh octopus salad with plenty of arugula and succulent lamb chops with pea tapenade.",0,0
55,Gigino at Wagner Park,Italian,2,"Holed up in Battery Park is this culinary jewel that is routinely frequented by downtown residents. Its cave-like entrance leads to a quiet, serene area as well as an open terrace rife with incredible views that all New Yorkers would treasure. This is the sort of place to kick back and enjoy the calm in a bustling city, while sipping from an intelligent, well-priced wine list. The food is just as precise and refined, thanks to a kitchen that understands the provenance of each dish. Find evidence of this in potato gnocchi bobbing in a slow-cooked tomato sugo dotted with tiny beef meatballs. Don't forget to give spaghetti del Padrino with colatura, anchovies, beets, and escarole a rightful whirl if only for its tempting garlic essence.",0,0
56,Balthazar,French,3,"As ageless as its beautiful patrons, the brassy and mirrored Balthazar should be called ""quintessentially SoHo"" because it invented the term. One of the benchmark brasseries from serial restaurateur Keith McNally, the attractive space is housed in a former tannery. Those whiffs of leather have been replaced by red awnings, scents of pastries, and an excellent oyster-filled raw bar completing its Parisian transformation. It seems as though every other table is topped with their bestselling steak frites-hardly a value but expertly prepared and served with a heaping side of fries. On the delicate side, sautéed skate is served with sweet raisins and tart capers; while silky beef tartare with shallots, herbs, and Worcestershire spreads just like butta.",0,0
57,Ed's Lobster Bar,Seafood,2,"Thanks to Ed's, there's no need to leave the city for an outstanding lobster roll. This seafood-driven favorite is a pitch-perfect encapsulation of the Northeast coast with a lively New York vibe. Inside the white-brick room, the long, gleaming marble bar is definitely the place to sit. With a mean Bloody Mary, pristine raw bar, and freshly caught daily chalkboard specials, Ed's has amassed a loyal following; aim for off-peak times to avoid the wait. Shareable appetizers of sweet and briny Ipswich clams are lightly fried for amazing salty-crisp contrast. Pewter caldrons of linguini bathed in olive oil with lemony-garlicky clams and toasted breadcrumbs are terrific. And that signature mayo- and butter-rich lobster roll is worth every calorie.",0,0
58,The Fat Radish,Contemporary,2,"British-leaning yet focused on local and seasonal cooking, this kitchen showcases two ways to indulge-choose between creative vegetarian dishes or old-world classics that are always worth the splurge. The farmhouse-style interior is a nice contrast to the Lower East Side setting, with exposed brick walls, charmingly mismatched wooden seats, and a distressed mirror listing daily specials. Guests may be torn between the hearty Scotch egg or macrobiotic plate. Yet the casual-cool servers will be quick to point out that just as much detail goes into the burger as the roasted cauliflower over braised lentils with sheep's milk yogurt. Finish the meal in British style with a slice of banoffee pie, with layers of banana, caramel toffee, and fluffy whipped cream.",0,0
59,Hirohisa,Japanese,3,"There's nothing like a discreet entrance to raise expectations-and Hirohisa is nicely concealed on Thompson Street. When you do find it you enter into a stylish, beautifully understated and meticulously laid out room that wouldn't look out of place in the pages of ""Wallpaper"" magazine. It's run with considerable charm by a discreet and very courteous Japanese team. A lack of headings makes the two-page menu a daunting document so, instead of trying to construct your own meal, you're better off letting the chefs decide by going for the balanced and seasonal dishes of the seven- or nine-course omakase. Two things will quickly become clear: the ingredients are exceptional and the technical skills of the chefs considerable. This is food that is as rewarding to eat as it is restorative; standouts will be the lingering flavor of Washu beef, perfectly grilled anago, and anything with uni or their homemade tofu. There are tables available but it's so much more satisfying to sit at the counter and engage with the chefs-this way, you may even find that there are a few more dishes in their repertoire than they advertise.",1,1
60,Bacaro,Italian,2,"Heavy iron candelabras, crumbling stone walls, and communal wooden tables lend a sultry vibe to this underground labyrinth, named for a Venetian bacaro (or counter for casual grazing of snacks and wine). The first floor's marble-topped bar beckons for small bites and a glass of wine, while nooks beneath low stone ceilings in the downstairs dining room call for a romantic evening over candlelight. Crafted by the same chef/owner of Peasant in NoLita, Bacaro's menu highlights the best of Venetian cuisine. Bigoli con sugo d'anatra brings together whole-wheat pasta with tender, pulled duck, a tomato-cream sauce, and shavings of salty parmesan. For dessert, the velvety flourless chocolate cake, topped with dried apricots, is as decadent as the setting.",0,0
61,Fung Tu,Asian,2,"It's a cool crowd that flocks to Fung Tu, tucked away in an up-and-coming Lower East Side pocket between the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridge. Inside, you'll find a long, narrow dining space where chatty millennials and thirty-something parents with toddlers in tow dine with equal ease; and a cool bar upfront is designed with plate-sharing and lingering in mind. The Chinese-influenced menu cleverly mines its home continent for deliciously exotic accents, but the ambitious dishes can be hit or miss. Surefire items include the springy egg noodles tossed with tender chopped clams, then laced with scallions, ginger, garlic, and chili oil; or fresh, perfectly-cooked sea bream served with fennel, tangerine peel, chili oil, and fermented black beans.",0,0
62,Balaboosta,Mediterranean,2,"It's hard to walk by and avoid falling in love with this thoroughly charming Mediterranean favorite and its keen (if wandering) eye on Sephardic cuisine. A small bar serves cocktails and organic wines while the dining room is full of bare tables, exposed brick walls, and shelves lined with bottles and books. Like the main arena, this kitchen bears a bright, friendly vibe. Here, smoke and fire take center stage in the shrimp cazuela, a tagine of plump shrimp, chickpeas, preserved lemons, and fiery jalapeño. Tender striped bass with crispy skin is a thoroughly comforting dish, served on a bed of sautéed mushrooms with buttery spinach and chewy black gnocchi, drizzled with crab bisque. Linger over kanafeh, syrup-soaked shredded filo dough stuffed with cheese.",0,0
63,Aquagrill,Seafood,2,"New York is no stranger to oysters but Aquagrill is an institution that puts the other shuckers to shame. A destination for all-things seafood since the 1990s, the menu features as many as 27 types of oysters each day, with patrons holing up at the bar to ingest dozens upon dozens of these bivalves with pitch-perfect wines to match. As always, the kitchen serves a fine lineup of heartier fish dishes including the downright sensual wild toro tartare with shiitakes, peppercress, and truffle-soy sauce. Pan-seared red snapper over crispy jasmine rice cakes and sautéed vegetables in ginger-peanut sauce is a show of well-balanced textures and bracing flavors; but a handmade chocolate sampler remains the true starlet, with each morsel as decadent as the next.",0,0
64,Café el Portal,Mexican,1,"In an area paved by PR campaigns and flashy restaurants, one authentic Mexican spot trudges on, in a pocket-sized room decked out with the bright colors of a hacienda. While some may view it as kitschy (it's hardly a hipster hangout), foodies gather here for the unique cooking churned out of this genuine kitchen. The fundamentals that distinguish authentic tacos from the Tex-Mex version are more than adequately covered in the carnitas taco. Tortillas, properly warmed on the comal, encase tender pulled pork and jalapeño and are topped with a complex, spicy salsa with just a pinch of cilantro-as fresh as any native could hope to taste. Foodies are equally thankful for the flor de calabaza quesadilla drizzled with avocado purée and filled with zucchini.",0,0
65,Louie and Chan,Italian,2,"With a name that nods to the convergence of Chinese and Italian immigrants in this part of lower Manhattan, Louie and Chan is a dimly lit, tightly packed restaurant with inspired cooking. The main space feels more bar than dining room, with intentionally scruffy walls decorated with distressed mirrors. Service is friendly and a young crowd keeps things lively. Cocktails are Asian-inspired while the menu uses Italy as its muse. Delicate gnudi arrive in a rustic bowl of tender lamb ragù topped with a dollop of smoked ricotta. A wood-burning oven is responsible for the blistered crust pizzas, including the bacio del diavolo, decked with tart tomato sauce, chunks of 'nduja, house-made mozzarella, and spicy whole Calabrese peppers.",0,0
66,Uncle Boons,Thai,2,"Can't afford a trip to Thailand? No problem. Head along to this whimsical and transporting den-brought to you stateside by husband-wife duo Matt Danzer and Ann Redding-and get sipping on Singha slushies among a lively crowd of downtowners. Tables are itsy-bitsy, but the kitchen feels immense in its creative vision and dilation of traditional Thai fare. Refined techniques and top ingredients combine to produce a blend of homegrown-haute cuisine that's presented with exceptional service here. Laab neuh gae sets hand-chopped lamb ablaze with chilies, lime, and mint, whereas tender snails doused in a gently spiced green curry reveal a deep knowledge of nuanced savors. Funky flavors reach full bloom in gaeng som muu krob, crisp pork belly floating in a tart tamarind curry of sausage-stuffed squid, perfectly foiled by sweet lychees. And for a brazen show of taste and texture, tuck into the crispy duck leg (pet palo), served in a soy-anise broth with caramelized tangerine and a soft-cooked egg. Dessert highlights include a coconut sundae accentuated by salty peanuts. And brioche French toast, dunked into condensed milk and caramelized to perfection, is a far cry from its ""milquetoast"" moniker.",1,1
67,Rubirosa,Italian,2,"Push back the dark red velvet curtain into the dimly lit narrow dining room to find out how very cool nonna can be on Mulberry Street. Although it may be loud and cramped with the requisite 80's tunes blaring overhead, this adept Italian-American kitchen is bright with classic dishes and a pizza recipe, which as the menu reads, is a 55-year old Staten Island heirloom. The classic pizza balances a cracker-thin crispy crust with tart tomato sauce and oven-browned spots of salty, melting mozzarella. Catch the pasta special like paccheri with subtly sweet and spicy sugo and meaty, tender roasted pork. Night owls may simply snack on the selection of alluring antipasti like mini arancini, but it's worth tasting how efficiently this kitchen can feed the crowds.",0,0
68,Houseman,American,2,"Just around the corner form the legendary Ear Bar, you'll find this amazing new offering courtesy of Chef/owner Ned Baldwin. Sporting a small, but sharply designed interior by Louis Yoh, replete with schoolhouse chairs and reclaimed bowling alley wood tables, Houseman's seasonal menu isn't extensive, but each dish is extremely well-sourced-not to mention well-executed, with the help of co-chef, Adam Baumgart. Kick things off with a grilled tomato salad, bursting with fresh herbs, salty feta and smoky shishito peppers. Then linger over a superbly fresh, slashed, and fried whole black sea bass, laced in a tarragon-forward herby sauce; or excellent, beer-braised sausage links, served with sweet caramelized onions and roasted banana peppers.",0,0
69,Blue Ribbon,Contemporary,3,"Blue Ribbon stays open until the wee hours, serving somewhat simple but particularly memorable food to SoHo's stylish set. Moreover, this unaffectedly warm and very classic bistro boasts zero pretense and deserves all praise that comes its way. Its décor may have stayed the same through the years-think timeless-but those bar seats remain a hot ticket. This ""chef's canteen"" as it is typically hailed is well-tread for masterpieces like fresh shucked oysters; smoked trout salad tossed with sour cream and zippy horseradish; or matzo ball soup-enjoyable, aromatic, and full of root vegetables. Fried chicken with mashed potatoes takes home the gold medal for comfort classics, while banana-walnut bread pudding with caramel sauce is the very essence of decadence.",0,0
70,Blue Ribbon Sushi,Japanese,3,"Set just below street level and down the block from its eldest sibling, Blue Ribbon Sushi is an inviting spot to watch the masters at work. A sushi bar dominates the space, with colorful sake bottles and premium spirits on display. The low, wood-covered ceilings and polished tables provide an intimate setting, while the counter is a prime perch for a solo diner. The staff may point to Americanized options, but it's best to trust the expert chefs and go with an omakase. The menu divides itself into Taiheiyo (""Pacific"") offerings, like the kohada spotted sardine, or a sweet and briny giant clam; and Taiseiyo (""Atlantic""), perhaps featuring fluke fin or a spicy lobster knuckle. Maki tempts with the karai kaibashire, with spicy minced scallop and smelt roe.",0,0
71,Giorgione,Italian,2,"In far west SoHo, beyond Chanel and Balenciaga, find this long-time resident cherished for its quiet location where Spring Street locals enjoy a slower pace-much like Italy itself. Founded by Dean & Deluca's Giorgio Deluca, the stylish and distinctly Italian L-shaped room focuses on straightforward pizza, outstanding pastas, and serious desserts. You can't go wrong with the handful of pastas on the menu, such as the lovingly crafted pouches of spinach and ricotta ravioli in a light tomato sauce. Delicately grilled lamb chops with peperonata and rosemary-roasted new potatoes are simple yet beguiling. Try one (or two) noteworthy desserts, including the flaky crostata filled with rich chocolate ganache and bright green pistacchio di Bronte.",0,0
72,Peasant,Italian,2,"Year after year, Peasant hits it out of the park-from the mouthwatering Italian food to the spot-on service to the utterly charming osteria spirit, Frank DeCarlo's ode to the Italian gathering spot is the essence of easy excellence. The décor is charmingly rustic-picture whitewashed walls, bare wood tables, and a bustling downstairs wine bar. Kick things off with ricotta and otherworldly bread, fresh from the visible centerpiece hearth-which is the main method of cooking and sets this spot apart. But save room for house-made lasagna with braised rabbit ragù, creamy béchamel, and sweet root vegetables; tender razor clams in a fragrant white wine broth; succulent porchetta studded with garlic and rosemary; or stewed and perfectly chewy trippa alla Romana.",0,0
73,Emporio,Italian,2,"Everything at Emporio has been strategically placed, from canned tomatoes by the open kitchen to the pressed-tin ceiling and reclaimed wood accents. It's this Italian-inspired café's attention to detail that has made it a local mainstay, filled with gorgeous crowds and friendly servers. Here, everyone shares conversation over sips set to go with complimentary spreads or ""aperitivo"" like crispy pancetta with rosemary. Although the space is small, flavors are huge, and the same attention that went into décor goes into the food-from grass-feed beef to excellent handmade orecchiette with cauliflower and shrimp. For a real treat, try a Nutella calzone-its wonderfully thin dough oozing with hazelnut-chocolate and topped with fresh cream and hazelnut crumb.",0,0
74,Snack,Greek,1,"No need to second-guess the purpose of Snack. It's a casual spot bursting with meze, where shoppers take a break from the jewel-box boutiques that flank this miniscule storefront. Here, juice glasses double as wine goblets, sepia-toned antique photographs line the space, and starting your meal with a baklava is perfectly acceptable. It's no surprise that two sister tavernas have sprouted in the West Village and Hell's Kitchen. The Mediterranean menu features plenty of signatures including marinated anchovies wrapped in grape leaves, garlicky skordalia, and earthy Macedonian wines. The chalkboard's daily specials are a great starting point, especially the palpoutsaka, smoky eggplant stuffed with sirloin and topped with tomatoes and béchamel.",0,0
75,Dirt Candy,Vegetarian,2,"Fans of this vegetarian temple were heartbroken when the original East Village location closed, but thankfully their grief was short-lived. Chef Amanda Cohen and team quickly transplanted themselves to bigger, bolder digs, where industrial elements meld with bright white walls and a chic bar proffers both cocktails and consolation seating. Dirt Candy's menu is best described as a bounty of creativity, with options like ""Fennel,"" a hearty salad of raw and pickled shavings with black bean cake and caramelized yogurt spread carta di musica; as well as ""Carrots,"" the orange veggies roasted with jerk spices and served over a carrot waffle with peanut mole sauce. Desserts are every bit as inspired, like a chocolate tart peppered with caramelized onions.",0,0
76,The River Café,Contemporary,4,"Thanks to its enviable location and stunning skyline vistas, this waterside favorite more than lives up to its reputation as one of the dreamiest escapes in town. Delicate details like fresh, fragrant flowers, beautifully set tables, and cozy rattan chairs make for romantic environs-and though the tight space has a way of turning intimate whispers into public displays of affection, all will be forgiven after a bite or two of Chef Brad Steelman's solid-as-ever cuisine. Launch into plump wild shrimp smothered in creamy Hollandaise and served with crunchy white asparagus for added texture; or the perfectly crisped crab cake arranged with creamy uni, avocado, and a light herb salad. Pearly white halibut with roasted maitakes is a testament to the kitchen's focus on simplicity and supreme freshness, while a glistening rack of mint- and mustard seed-glazed lamb-charred on the outside with an evenly pink interior-exemplifies its artistry. Enjoy dessert, as the mouthwatering offerings (think milk chocolate soufflé with melted marshmallow, or dark chocolate marquise topped with a replica of the nearby Brooklyn Bridge) are a veritable education in soigné presentations and sumptuous flavors.",1,1
77,Cafe Katja,Austrian,2,"Beer mugs are clinking and schnapps is flowing at the rustic Cafe Katja. After slowly expanding to neighboring storefronts over the past few years, the owners have now realized its much-deserved grandeur without losing its charm. Expats plus locals are de rigueur here, and routinely stop in for incredibly delicious and unbelievably hearty eats. Co-chef and owner Erwin Schrottner (who hails from outside Graz) keeps everything authentic, from house-made bratwurst platters to the mustard sour cream. The pretzels arrive straight from Europe as divine carbo-bombs served with liptauer cheese and butter. The idea of warm chocolate cake may seem passé, but this rendition with terrifically bittersweet orange marmalade is a treat for all the senses.",0,0
78,Public,Fusion,3,"Let the other restaurants copy each other down to the table linens: Public has always done it's own thing, and boy, does it do it right. Housed in an old loading dock in SoHo, Public still sports elevated garage doors on its exterior, but the sexy interior is pure style and grace. The décor features unique bronze mailboxes, where box-holders are delivered artisanal wines hand-selected by the chef, and private rooms contoured with billowing fabrics. A first-come, first-serve ""Sunday Supper"" menu is offered every Sunday with limited seating, and almost always sells out. Chef Brad Farmerie's menu is truly innovative-fusion might be an overused descriptor, but it aptly describes his style. Never shy to marry unique items in interesting ways (think smoked paprika oil paired with pea shoots), a sample Farmerie dinner might include house-made ricotta cavatelli tossed in a lovely carrot sauce fashioned like a Bolognese, with pickled ramps, candied sunflower seeds, and a ramp purée; or tender New Zealand venison with pickled beets, hibiscus, currants, and a quinoa-black garlic salad. End on a high with pea-and-crème fraîche ice cream with green matcha, sponge cake, ganache, and lemon tapioca.",1,1
79,Mercer Kitchen,Contemporary,3,"Whether you're here to pick at a salad or up your intake of carbs, Jean-Georges' slick restaurant within the Mercer Hotel has something for you. It has been an inexorable part of the SoHo scene for over a decade and so knows what its customers want and how to keep them coming back. Those customers are quite an international bunch and the restaurant provides them with stylish surroundings and a healthy dose of glamour-the occasional sighting of someone from the sunny side of Celebrity Street helps too. The extensive menu is an appealing document, with everything from hot dogs to pizza, seafood platters to roast chicken. Servings are reassuringly generous yet the kitchen has a commendably light touch-try the wonderful Peekytoe crab fritters.",0,0
80,Ciccio,Italian,2,"Chef/owner Giacomo Romano defines this brilliant little restaurant as an alimentaria-a place where patrons can find ever-changing temptations day or night. This may mean hearty ribollita for lunch or satisfying pasta for dinner. The sunny space is a former antique store that fashions a raw look through whitewashed brick walls and blonde wood tables. Simple, unpretentious food is the signature here, in dishes like insalata di carota, mixing sweet roasted carrots, peppery arugula, and pumpkin seeds-grab wedges of bread to soak up its citrusy vinaigrette. Fresh pasta is a must, especially the strisce alla Chiantigiana tossed with a reduction of wine, guanciale, and red onions. End with a perfect espresso or rich and oozing molten chocolate cake.",0,0
81,Raoul's,French,3,"It's the nature of all great cities to constantly change but that doesn't mean severing ties to the past. Raoul's has been around since the '70s-which alone qualifies it as an ""institution""-but this is no museum piece living on past glories. Wander in on any given night and you'll see a crowd of all ages united in their fondness for French food and their ability to enjoy themselves. The menu wouldn't necessarily entice the passer-by on content alone but the kitchen has a surprisingly delicate touch that raises dishes above the ordinary, whether that's tender octopus with chickpea purée or succulent rack of lamb with oyster mushrooms. In the stampede to find all that is new, shiny and hot we shouldn't ignore those whose sin is mere longevity.",0,0
82,Rebelle,French,3,"Heat-seeking foodies on the hunt for the next big thing have found it at this chic bistro from the owners of Pearl & Ash. The dining room is as dim as a cave-its palette of concrete and ebony brightened only by a white marble bar and gracious team of servers who know when they're needed and seem to disappear when they're not. Rebelle has an edgy vibe-the space was once a burlesque bar, after all. But, beneath that veneer is impressive talent delivered with a sexy French accent. While Chef Daniel Eddy's streamlined presentations and foam flourishes have contemporary flair, rest assured that classic technique is at the root of every dish. Lamb tartare is perfectly balanced, boasting piment d'Espelette-kissed cubes of meat tossed with green chickpeas, strained yogurt, and a slice of excellent toasted bread. Then, exceptionally tender pork loin is served over a mustard-tinged sauce with wilted greens, grilled spring onions, and a delicious bite of deep-fried headcheese. For dessert, gâteau Saint-Honoré is seasonally reimagined as crisp layers of pâte feuilletée, mascarpone pastry cream, and fragrant wild strawberries adorned with tiny strawberry- caramel-lacquered profiteroles.",1,1
83,Pearl & Ash,Contemporary,2,"For small plates that spark contemplation, this deep, dark, and narrow restaurant delivers. Long wood tables line the room under a striking wall of boxes puzzle-pieced together to showcase collectibles like antique cameras. Shimmering subway tiles, an atmospheric soundtrack, and dim lighting lend a sultry feel. House-smoked whole wheat bread arrives with freshly churned ""chicken butter"" (that's butter with chicken fat) and maple syrup. A lamb belly and guajillo pepper roulade rests in goat-milk yogurt, topped with crushed almonds, pea tendrils, and paper-thin slices of radish. Confit fingerling potatoes are buried under an avalanche of porcini purée with smoky chorizo over the top. The negroni ice cream sandwich has quickly risen to signature status.",0,0
84,cocoron,Japanese,1,"Don't mind the manga posters or the menu's colorful cartoons; this is a serious destination for all things soba. The room is cramped and the furniture flimsy, yet a seat at the counter facing the open kitchen promises excellent cold, warm, and dip soba noodles. Service underwhelms and the scene is quirky, but the focus here is solely on the noodles and noodles alone. Curry dip soba arrives as a shallow bamboo basket of firm, chilled noodles just as a heavily spiced sauce with pork, ginger, and green onion bubbles away in a clay pot set atop a small flame. Dunk these strands of cold soba into the hot broth and let the slurping begin. Then rest assured that when you're done, the curry is fortified with hot soba water to form a delicious and drinkable soup.",0,0
85,The Dutch,American,3,"Buzzy and beloved since day one, Chef Andrew Carmellini's The Dutch has quickly become a major hit and SoHo institution. Its primo corner windows open onto the sidewalk, tempting guests inside with a stocked oyster bar, cozy banquettes, and a sharply dressed service staff. The menu is just as seductive as the space, familiar but with fresh updates. Highlights include a roundabout take on the plump fried oyster po' boy, made here with mustard-pickled okra remoulade. Tasty pastas refresh the menu consistently; you might find black rigatini tossed with tender squid and spicy pork sausage, finished with fiery breadcrumbs. Desserts are divine, with fresh pies made daily, such as salted lime pie with passion fruit, nata de coco, and coconut sorbet.",0,0
86,Congee Village,Chinese,1,"From the edge of Chinatown comes Congee Village, with its neon-etched sign that shines bright at night. Coveted for its fantastic cooking (check the front window for a slew of accolades), the menu also has a Cantonese focus. Service is basic and the décor kitschy at best, but it's clean, tidy, and tons of fun. This soothing namesake porridge comes in myriad forms-ladled into a clay pot with bits of crispy roasted duck skin, or mingled with pork liver and white fish to form an intense and rich flavor combination. Pair it with dunkable sticks of puffy deep-fried Chinese crullers for a satisfying contrast in texture. Less adventurous palates may deviate into such solid standards as sautéed short ribs and sweet onions tossed in a smoky black pepper sauce.",0,0
87,Navy,Seafood,2,"Only Navy could pull off a nautical-themed restaurant with repurposed WWII military duffle bags, and panels of distressed copper as well as antique sconces on the walls. Everything is beyond chic here, from the former bowling alley bench banquette, to that massive espresso machine used to serve coffee and pastries to early-to-rise SoHo-ites. But seafood rules after breakfast, when the raw bar spouts oysters, clams, sea urchin, as well as bright Mediterranean white wine. The menu presents culinary hedonism at its finest, like mussel toast: plump mollusks, paprika, and caper aïoli spread over crunchy sourdough bread. Similarly, soft-shell crabs arrive atop a squash blossom pancake with hints of anchovy, and are accented with a dreamy blend of maple syrup.",0,0
88,Cata,Spanish,2,"Blue plaid and jean-clad waiters set the casual tone for Cata, a downtown-cool restaurant with a long bar and glass case displaying the day's fresh seafood. Distressed mirrors, vaulted ceilings, and iron accents fill the dark, cavernous space with a certain broody, old-world vibe. Long communal tables are ideal for groups lingering over small plates and a long list of gin-based cocktails. Nibbling should be the strategy here, starting with whole deviled eggs stuffed with tangy-sweet gribiche beneath a single crunchy fried oyster. Crispy bite-sized bombas filled with creamy potato, Manchego, and Serrano ham sit in a very nice, mildly spicy tomato sauce. Paella is ever-pleasing with head-on shrimp, chorizo, and a satisfying socarrat at the bottom of the pan.",0,0
89,Chefs Club,Contemporary,4,"Like a never-ending All-Star game featuring the country's best dishes, the innovative concept behind Chefs Club (by Food & Wine) is a rotating lineup of the magazine's ""Best New Chefs"" honorees over the years. If that weren't exciting enough, the space itself is visually stunning, featuring a state-of-the-art open kitchen with a striking blue-tile backdrop; a sensational modern bar; and lots of loud music to set the mood. Dinner might include a cool, creamy spring pea soup dotted with pickled pearl onions and fresh herbs; or expertly smoked and seared Hudson Valley foie gras paired with sunchoke purée, apple chips, and buttermilk-thyme jam. Squab à la plancha is then glazed with sage-honey and served over grilled confit leeks with a giblet ragout.",0,0
90,Burger & Barrel,Gastropub,2,"Comfort food becomes downright elegant at this urbane gastropub, where clubby leather booths, louvered blinds, and requisite chalked-up blackboards stay on the approachable side of chic. When the long bar and closely set tables are at capacity, conversations bouncing off the wood-paneled walls can reach a dull roar. Still, the atmosphere remains relaxed. The modern pub menu covers all the bases with panache. The griddled Bash burger, slathered with house-made caramelized onion and bacon jam crowned with two crisp onion rings, is a memorable affair. Lighter dishes like a traditional panzanella with chewy-crusty bread cubes and translucent cucumber slices; or chilled sweet-and-tart corn soup with chunks of peekytoe crab are just as satisfying.",0,0
91,Rouge et Blanc,Contemporary,3,"The lines between Vietnamese and French cuisines are blurred at Rouge et Blanc, a cozy restaurant with an Indochine-influenced décor. A burlap-covered ceiling, red lacquered chairs, handcrafted pottery, and plants add up to an intimate setting on one of SoHo's quiet side streets. The cuisine avoids common fusion pitfalls to display a balanced approach to cooking, through dishes such as the green papaya salad enlivened with a green curry vinaigrette and crunchy-fried head-on shrimp. Excellent specials include pho ramped up with a lemongrass- and chili oil-laced broth and tender grilled duck breast. Braised beef cheeks showcase classic Vietnamese flavors of cloves, anise, and nuoc cham. A noteworthy selection of French wines complements the delectable menu.",0,0
92,Russ & Daughters Cafe,Deli,2,"From white-jacketed servers to that pristine counter, this updated yet model LES café channels the very spirit and charm of its mothership, set only blocks away. The adept kitchen follows suit, taking the original, appetizing classics and turning them on their heads to form an array of proper and profoundly flavorful dishes. Regulars perch at the bar to watch the 'tender whip up a cocktail or classic egg cream, while serious diners find a seat and get noshing on hot- and cold-smoked Scottish salmon teamed with potato crisps. The result? A thrilling contrast in flavor and texture. Caramelized chocolate babka French toast is crowned with strawberries for a sweet-savory treat; and ""eggs Benny"" with salmon, spinach, and challah never fails to peg a bruncher.",0,0
93,The Musket Room,Contemporary,3,"The Musket Room is just the restaurant Nolita deserves. Service is incredibly hospitable; and whitewashed walls, raw timber, mortar-smeared brick, and modern Danish chairs fashion a farmhouse-chic interior that's as head-turning as the willowy young locals. To whet their thirst, wine bottles topping a wall-length table in the back dining room are presented and poured with panache. Chef Matt Lambert's forte is the modern cuisine of New Zealand with a contemporary twist. While he may be a Kiwi ambassador, Chef Lambert uses his understanding of very particular ingredients to craft dishes that are seasonal, delicious, and sometimes wildly creative. A rum-cured torchon of foie gras is at once dense yet melting upon contact, accompanied by sweet dates, tart green apple gel, and buttery brioche. Provenance is clearly a high priority in the exceptional Ora king salmon; the bright and supple tranche is topped with freeze-dried Satsuma, citrus oil, and herbs to complement its delicate flavor. For dessert, the superb carrot cake pulls together a spectrum of textures and tastes. However, the stark white, crisp pavlova filled with passion fruit curd, whipped cream, slivered strawberries, and passion fruit pulp is a true classic.",1,1
94,Estela,Contemporary,3,"Despite the fact that it's hidden in plain sight, this muy cozy charmer manages to attract a crowd of VIP's (ahem, President Obama). The narrow dining room is loud and cramped, boasting a kitchen that has both its eye on simplicity and an applause-worthy knack for elegant offerings. To that end, Estela's irreverent chef turns out focused, decidedly creative, and (very) small plates. Grilled bread laden with mussels and a tangy aïoli turns into a dazzling bite when paired with pickled carrots, just as beef tartare tossed in chili oil is smartly teamed with sunchoke crisps for sweet and savory hints. And while your greeting upon entry may be less than agreeable, a quivering, bee pollen-crowned panna cotta makes for an utterly perfect goodbye.",0,0
95,Gran Eléctrica,Mexican,2,"Looking to market ingredients and a California-style approach to Mexican cuisine, this chic yet comfortable restaurant impresses with its lovely décor and lively vibe. Servers are engaged and enthusiastic about the menu's pleasures. An ideal visit starts with a margarita at the bar and moves to the garden as strings of lights flicker to life. Mexico and Brooklyn are in balance on a menu that includes small plates such as memelitas de frijoles, a masa disc topped with mashed black beans, spicy salsa verde, queso fresco, and crema. Flavor is bright in the deliciously untraditional poblano chile relleno stuffed with Havarti, roasted tomato-jalapeño salsa, and tortillas. Try the frijoles de la olla (black beans topped with avocado) on the side.",0,0
96,Cómodo,Latin American,2,"This charming, candlelit restaurant flaunts a Latin tilt while maintaining its very American, homey feel. Away from artsy SoHo this quiet slice of the neighborhood draws locals looking for an unfussy meal with bright flavors. The small space has exposed brick, two long communal tables, a semi-open kitchen, and carefully chosen music. Detail sets Cómodo apart, beginning with a thick, deep evergreen cilantro soup poured tableside, over a mound of fresh crab, smoky roasted poblano peppers, and tart goat cheese. The interesting and very approachable dishes go on to include lamb sliders on pão de queijo (Brazilian bread made with cheese and cassava) finished with a pop of chipotle cream. Coffee-rubbed slow-roasted pork shoulder shouldn't be missed.",0,0
97,Emilio's Ballato,Italian,2,"This unassuming Houston St. standard is an unsung hero, even if many walk past Emilio's gold- and red-etched window and write it off as some run-of-the-mill red sauce joint. Step inside the narrow, weathered space, where owner Emilio Vitolo offers each guest a personal welcome and a genuine Italian-American experience. The menu is filled with pasta classics like Roman cacio e pepe, tossed with sharp pecorino cheese and freshly ground black pepper. Signature specialties include pollo Emilio, a delicately breaded chicken cutlet draped in lemon-caper sauce; and plump clams oreganata speckled with garlicky breadcrumbs. Crisp cannoli shells filled with vanilla- and cinnamon-tinged ricotta cream rival any other version found from Palermo to Siracusa.",0,0
98,Charlie Bird,Italian,3,"Of all the cool out-of-the-way restaurants that dot this stretch of SoHo, perhaps none are hipper than little Charlie Bird. You'll be greeted by a blast of music the second you hit the door, where a long bar leads to a cozy, brick-lined dining space with leather seats. From there, things just take off: along with the clever, urbane menu, an upbeat service staff, and thoughtful wine list brimming with sweet Puglian reds and organic Catalonians, the kitchen delights long before Chef/co-owner Ryan Hardy's renowned pastas hit your plate. Think tender rigatoni with fennel-roasted suckling pig; or perfectly al dente spaghetti alla carbonara piled into a heavenly ball and topped with buttery spring onions, smoked bacon, and a bright yellow duck egg.",0,0
99,Contra,Contemporary,2,"Avant-garde Contra brims with a youthful vibe, from the music overhead to the chefs' creativity. Beyond the entrance's neon sign is a small, lamp-lit space with exposed brick and inviting banquettes. At the bar, patrons can sample the forward-thinking fare or fully indulge in an affordable five-course menu. An experimental spirit is clear from the first bite of a warm poppy- and sesame seed-loaf brushed with pork fat and served with sweet-cream butter. Mackerel arrives with blistered skin, tender peas, favas, and charred Padron peppers. Superlative desserts show glimmers of genius, as in the loosely whipped cloud of sunchoke purée with warm toffee caramel and icy apple granita. Visit Wildair a few doors down for like-minded cuisine in a more casual setting by the same team.",0,0
100,Sauce,Italian,1,"What would you expect from a spot called Sauce? Some serious and very delicious red sauce-naturally! Serving Italian-American comfort food with a nostalgic décor to match, Sauce stays modern with its local, hipster-friendly playlist, and quirky ambience-the attractive crowd doesn't hurt either. It's a fun meal to say the least. Pasta is made in-house daily, with specials that feature potato-kale gnocchi or the signature ricotta cavatelli showered with pecorino. The menu highlights regional specialties from Little Italys across the country, including SF's cioppino and classic Nuyorkese tomato gravy like nonna used to make. Try the robust Sergio Leone steak smothered in tomato sauce and topped with a fried heritage egg for tons of fun and flavor.",0,0
101,Miss Lily's,Jamaican,2,"Authentic Jamaican flavors and thumping reggae go hand-in-hand amid Miss Lily's bright orange booths, retro artifacts, and Formica-topped tables. Wide-open windows overlooking buzzy Houston Street merely add to the allure. A well-stocked bar and bins filled with produce set the mood for enjoyable classics brought to you at the hands of glam servers. Start with jerk chicken that is insanely moist yet nearly black with intense spices, served with Scotch bonnet sauce that will have your mouth tingling for hours. Then cool down with Melvin's ""body good"" salad tossing kale, radish, celery, and apples in a citrus-ginger vinaigrette. From the Jamaican Sampler-think curry coat, oxtail stew, and callaloo-to a boozy rum cake, this Caribbean queen reigns supreme.",0,0
102,ZZ's Clam Bar,Seafood,4,"A bouncer greets you at the door of this sexy little seafood nook, where you're ushered into a tiny, beautifully appointed dining room lined with just five white marble tables and sleek dark wood paneling. For a hot second, you might feel like you're the only one in the know about this secret lair, until the hip diners rubbing elbows at every table disabuse you of this notion. But really, once you get past the silly bouncer, you will never want to leave this den. And although you'll pay a handsome price for small portions here, when each bite sings with this much freshness and flavor, who's counting? Kick things off with anything from the amazing raw bar, where you'll find wildly fresh goodies like creamy oysters bursting with briny flavor. Then move on to delicate, salty trout roe laced with truffle honey and set over a thick slice of buttery toast; otherworldly uni toast, perfectly sweet and laid over malty pretzel with mustard oil and chopped chives; or melt-in-your-mouth Chianina beef carpaccio with luxurious Santa Barbara uni and caviar. And finally, this sleek, contoured, and sexy bar puts out some of the most sublime cocktails in town.",1,1
103,Cherche Midi,French,3,"Restaurateur Keith McNally went back to his bistro roots with Cherche Midi, his restaurant on a bustling SoHo epicenter of sorts. Romantic, French, and timeless, this inviting space is filled with spectacular flower arrangements, burgundy leather booths, antique mirrors, and a semi-round bar with wood stools. A pot de fromage sets the tone for the meal. This luscious parmesan custard, served with toast points slathered in anchovy butter, is simple, satisfying with just the right amount of richness. At lunch, a steak sandwich with aged Gruyère and bacon marmalade on a Balthazar-baked brioche bun is a hit. At dinner, opt for elevated classics like the bone-in skate wing meunière with onion-fennel soubise. Don't forget some pencil-thin pommes frites on the side.",0,0
104,Lupa,Italian,2,"One of the best places for a solid plate of pasta, Lupa fits in snugly between the fire escape-clad walk-ups and charming boutiques along these streets. A modestly decorated spot named for the she-wolf who raised Romulus and Remus, this gem carries an air of relaxed sophistication. It's where neighbors can gather for polite conversation over quartinos of Ligurian wine or the massive collection of amari. If it's a lovely place to sit, it's a stellar place to dine. Textbook-perfect pasta shines here, with luscious bucatini all' amatriciana earning its mark among Lazio classics as well as the beguilingly simple yet stunning cacio e pepe. Entrées may sometimes miss the mark, but dessert more than makes up for it-try the unique cardamom panna cotta.",0,0
105,Gato,Mediterranean,2,"It's been nearly a decade since Bobby Flay opened a restaurant in NY, and Gato has the famed chef's recipe down. With soaring arched brick ceilings, exposed brass fixtures, and views of Lafayette Street, this hip hangout exudes a slick downtown sensibility. In fact, the cozy lounge and massive wooden bar are so cool, you may never make it to the dining room-which is fine, because the beautifully composed small plates pack plenty of flavor. Case in point: quail egg and creamy uni atop a tender artichoke on a plate dressed up with dots of oils and shellfish reduction. Lamb tenderloin needs hardly any marinade thanks to the top-quality meat, a rich pink center, and salsa verde; while smoky eggplant balances earthy and sweet with Manchego and balsamic vinegar.",0,0
106,Atrium,Contemporary,3,"This industrial bi-level space has a rather iconic setting along the waterfront, between the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. Dark wood dominates the light-filled interior, amid metal accents and walls that sprout greenery to soften the room. The food may have a farm-to-table focus, but a contemporary tilt is clear in everything that emerges from Atrium's bustling open kitchen. Elegant ""baby greens"" arrive as enticingly charred root vegetables over peppery arugula coulis; whereas crisply seared red snapper served over wild rice with dashi-simmered baby turnips, meaty mushrooms, and finished with a rich fumet makes the chef's (Laurent Kalkotour) French heritage abundantly clear. The chocolate-dipped crème fraîche and quark cheesecake is deservedly popular.",0,0
107,Carbone,Italian,4,"With nostalgia at the forefront, Carbone is plain gorgeous. While this big, bold, and beautiful ode to Italian-Americana comes alive at night under the low lights, lunch is equally admired among brash bankers with big appetites and Valentino-donning divas. That same sense of history pervades the entire space, which highlights plush banquettes, impressive ceramics, and glittering chandeliers. Was the striking tiled-floor inspired from a certain restaurant scene in The Godfather? Probably. Mid-century classics are what this menu is all about, but exalted ingredients, skill, and presentations will excite even the most cynical savant. Stylish servers-who work the floor with a little flirt and lot of flair-remain in character while presenting top antipasti like crusty garlic bread, soppressata, and fresh, particularly divine olive oil-dunked mozzarella. A Caesar salad tossed tableside with carb-worthy croutons and gently pickled white anchovies hits the ball out of the park, while pale-yellow, ricotta-filled tortellini over an intensely rich and meaty ragù is a laudable delight. Desserts like a proper cheesecake set atop a cookie-crumb base and laced with lemon curd is New York in all its old-school glory.",1,1
108,Spitzer's Corner,Gastropub,2,"Spitzer's is a spirited corner eatery dedicated to craft brews and gastropub fare in a buzzing locale. Large glass windows overlook the heart of the neighborhood, providing an entertaining vantage point for people-watching over pints of nutty Bronx Pale Ale. There are large communal tables made of reclaimed wood and chalkboards listing comfort food classics. This is a cozy drinking den, and its kitchen focuses on food that pairs well with suds. Tables are laden with quality renditions of burgers and mac 'n cheese. Spinach and artichoke dip is equally comforting, topped with broiled cheese and served with chargrilled pita. A fried chicken sandwich sees generous chunks of crunchy thigh meat stuffed into potato rolls with butter lettuce and a pickle.",0,0
109,Wassail,Gastropub,2,"Everyone's buzzing about Wassail's awesome list of 90+ ciders from around the world, but there are a few delectable reasons to check out this Lower East Side gem. Chef Joseph Buenconsejo's vegetable- and grain-focused menu is initially a surprise, but the technique, seasonality, and personality he brings to each dish will sway even the most adamant carnivore. Witness peas done three ways-mashed, julienned, sliced in their pods, and plated with creamy ricotta, pea broth, and mini parathas; or a glossy, slow-cooked egg served over salty broccolini and shredded Brussels sprouts with a lemony sorrel Hollandaise. Rebecca Eichenbaum's savory-leaning desserts, like a frozen spruce soufflé topped with buttermilk granita and pistachio crumble, are pure bliss.",0,0
110,DBGB Kitchen & Bar,French,2,"Super chef, Daniel Boulud, shakes off some of his signature upmarket panache with this downtown favorite. The fun-for-all brasserie joins a lively bar area to a rear dining room, open kitchen, and chef's table. The space recalls the Bowery's history as a hub for restaurant supplies: dry goods are prominently shelved, bathroom walls are papered with vintage cookware catalogs, and gleaming copper pots (engraved with the names of famed French chefs) are on display. Luxe burgers and a globally inspired lineup of house-made sausages are all popular. But go on to explore other dishes like the lunch prix-fixe offering decadent country pâté, ricotta and spinach ravioli in Vermont veal Bolognese, as well as a lemon bar with meringue bits and blueberry sorbet.",0,0
111,Jack the Horse,American,2,"A Brooklyn Heights favorite, this sleepy American tavern is a consistent spot in a neighborhood that lacks a variety of serious eats. Exposed brick walls covered with old-fashioned clocks set a cozy tone, and regulars return for the well-stocked bar with myriad bitters and a bargain three-course prix-fixe. Slurp a few bivalves at the Oyster Room next door before settling into a table, or if thirst beckons, sip an Old Fashioned with barrel strength Bourbon while perusing the menu. Some locals head straight for the burger-focaccia layered with Gruyère, caramelized Bourbon onions, and a juicy beef patty. Though ricotta and butternut squash ravioli, tossed in sweet brown butter and topped with crumbled smoky bacon, is a fine alternative.",0,0
112,Bowery Meat Company,Steakhouse,4,"It's official: Chef Josh Capon, also of Lure Fishbar and El Toro Blanco, can now add sizzling steaks to his impressive wheelhouse. Cozy velvet booths, dusky blue floor-to-ceiling drapery, and dark wood details honor the swagger of the steakhouse archetype, but crowds of millennials lend a fresh face to this buzzy downtown address. A list of specially selected oysters from the raw bar-like kumamotos from Washington State dressed with wasabi leaf and lemon-or zucchini carpaccio with feta and toasted pistachios prelude Bowery Meat Company's red-blooded roster. This may reveal a bone-in filet mignon au poivre, dry-aged NY strip, and grilled pork ribeye with Korean barbecue sauce. And, don't overlook those side dishes-the sour cream and onion hash brown is a must.",0,0
113,Mas (farmhouse),Contemporary,3,"Tucked away on Bedford Street, Mas (farmhouse) proves why restaurant design matters as much as the menu when creating a complete sensory experience. Carefully selected accents-weathered wood beams, hand-stitched pillows, antique mother-of-pearl napkin rings-bring to life a modern Provençal farmhouse, where rusticity, hospitality and sophistication play in perfect harmony with the culinary arts. Poached shrimp floats in an apple-ginger bath topped with radish, for a cooling yet spicy amuse-bouche to arouse the appetite. This may be followed by delicate fillets of Long Island fluke served over hearts of palm with smoky and earthy shiitake mushrooms. That attention to detail and mouth-filling flavor keeps you engaged, charmed, and absolutely satisfied.",0,0
114,Blue Ribbon Bakery,Contemporary,3,"The origin of this very New York bistro begins with brothers Eric and Bruce Bromberg discovering an abandoned brick oven in the basement of a bodega. This sparked the idea for a bakery, and in 1998 Blue Ribbon Bakery joined the duo's restaurant family. The sunny corner location is an inviting space, from the creaky wood-plank flooring to the heady aroma of freshly baked bread downstairs. Seats at the bar are a hot commodity for solo diners. Opt for a dish that showcases the bakery's bread, such as the beef marrow with bacon bread and onion marmalade, a decadent appetizer that is just the right amount of sweet, salty, tart, and rich. Fried chicken with silky mashed potatoes and the matzoh ball soup both show Blue Ribbon's skill with comforting classics.",0,0
115,A Casa Fox,Latin American,2,"This bold and bright darling serves superlative Latin fare with fantastic authenticity and a whole lotta love. This is largely thanks to Chef/owner Melissa Fox, who can be seen in the open kitchen or checking on guests in the snug space, filled with Mexican tiles, wide plank floors, and a warming fireplace. Be sure to begin any meal with a selection of empanadas, as in pulled pork with caramelized onion, chorizo and aged manchego, or the outstanding carne enchorizada (seasoned ground beef with onions, tomatoes, yucca, chayote, and potatoes). Other dishes might include the camarones a las brazes, grilled shrimp in a sour-orange marinade wrapped in smoky bacon; or chicken tostones, its pulled meat on a well-grilled round of masa with crema and mango salsa.",0,0
116,L'Apicio,Italian,2,"Despite being named for an 18th century Italian cookbook, this buzzy trattoria is a contemporary hit. A downtown vibe courses throughout the swanky den that is slightly rustic and industrial-this setting is worth dressing up for. Half of the room is devoted to the bar, and the private dining room is best suited to exhibitionists who enjoy dining within glass walls in the center of the room. Bright flavors and skilled creativity combine in their tailored selection of Italian plates designed for grazing. Start with dishes like fried green tomatoes capped with sweet basil pesto and milky mozzarella, or fresh agnolotti stuffed with sweetbreads. Finish with a wedge of moist olive oil cake sweetened with crème fraîche and vin santo-soaked raisins.",0,0
117,SakaMai,Japanese,3,"A modern izakaya like no other, SakaMai sets a new standard for downtown cuisine. With its chic urban style, a curated sake- shochu- and whiskey-list, and creative dishes, this authentic haunt draws a food- and drink-focused crowd that's more interested in Japanese sips than pints of beer. Plates are meant to be shared, sashimi are top-notch, and flavors simply impress: a well-seasoned Waygu steak arrives with roasted vegetables and tasty sauces; while a porcelain sea urchin shell, filled with gently scrambled eggs, caviar, and more sea urchin, is as decadent as it sounds. For an exceptional balance between flavor and texture, try the kanpachi dressed with a chiffonade of shiso, myoga, yuzu juice, freshly ground wasabi, and shoyu glaze.",0,0
118,Saxon + Parole,Contemporary,3,"Named after two 19th century racehorses, this spirited hipster-magnet is the creation of Executive Chef Brad Farmerie and the AvroKO Hospitality Group. Rich wood tones and warm lighting achieve a clubby atmosphere, from the buzzing long bar and communal table to the intimate, serene dining room's banquettes dressed with pristine linens. Begin with a palate-pleasing surprise in cocktails like the celery gimlet. Then, sample rotating house-made ""pots"" filled with mousses like eggplant topped with sweet-sour relish and taro chips, or chicken liver with port and pepper jelly served with grilled sourdough bread. Seared branzino over cranberry bean and kale stew with tomato-caper broth and shaved fennel highlights wonderfully complementary flavors.",0,0
119,Bianca,Italian,2,"There's a reason diners from all over the city clamor to squeeze into Bianca's low-lit and lovely little dining room, despite its no reservations policy. This is home-style Italian fare with finesse-where the pasta is cooked by someone accomplished in the understanding of what Italian pasta is and is not. Bianca's intimate and sultry atmosphere makes it a great date night spot, with couples knocking elbows over dishes like the lasagnette di verdure, a delicate eggplant, zucchini and tomato tart of sorts. Others delight in the soft tagliolini ai frutti di mare, tossed with wildly fresh seafood and a long-simmered tomato sauce; or plump, fennel-studded Italian sausage (salsiccie e fagioli), paired with a hearty and savory cannellini bean stew.",0,0
120,Il Buco,Italian,2,"Il Buco is a molto charming amalgam of antique knickknacks, porcelain dishes, and polished copper pots. The hardest seats to nab are found downstairs, but the rustic dining room remains as inviting as ever, with tables full of vittles and vino. The kitchen showcases meticulously sourced ingredients that sing the praises of regional Italian know-how, like a mound of arugula, petite mustards, and chrysanthemum greens that top a rather tiny veal Milanese cooked to moist perfection. Thick ribbons of toothsome homemade tagliatelle tossed with myriad mushrooms, melted leeks, and pecorino emits a lovely aroma, befitting this unique and pretty pearl. Meanwhile, the porchetta-served once a year as a sort of sidewalk celebration-is still one of the best in town.",0,0
121,The Stanton Social,Fusion,2,"This hugely favored haunt's low lighting, thumping beats, and beautiful crowd clearly say nightlife lounge, but its roster of pleasing creations establish the kitchen as an expert in flavors and textures. The multi-level room is sexy yet remains timeless despite its age. Those chic, dark leather banquettes provide plenty of space for large groups to kick back to whatever the DJ spins in the second-floor lounge. This isn't a place for conversation between friends, but rather a large group destination for delicious small plates like crisp red snapper tacos with creamy avocado and zesty mango salsa. Tasty Asian flavors combine seamlessly with chunks of skewered salmon cooked rare and coated in crunchy sriracha-infused peas over cold soba and earthy beets.",0,0
122,Macondo,Latin American,2,"Readers of Gabriel Garcia Marquez will be familiar with this Latin American restaurant's name-Macondo is the fictional setting of 100 Years of Solitude. Here on the Lower East Side (and at the West Village outpost), it is an intimate small plates restaurant with a long bar of counter seating, semi-open kitchen, and exposed brick walls with stocked shelves of Latin pantry ingredients. Sharing is the strategy here, from the crispy chicken croquettes to the raw kale and manchego salad with crunchy roasted pumpkin seeds and a sweet kick from sticky dried dates, topped with a lemon-chipotle dressing. Be prepared to battle over the last bite of arroz con pollo, a piping-hot cast iron pan of plump bomba rice, piquant chorizo, tender chicken, and cherry tomatoes.",0,0
123,Le Philosophe,French,2,"With its bustling open kitchen and Parisian den good looks-think polished wood banquettes, bistro chalkboards and walls lined with black-and-white portraits of philosophers-Le Philosophe cuts a stylish figure. It's the kind of wonderful, low-key spot that begs you to become a regular: vibrant, casual and polished, with the kind of beer list you get excited about and a menu that (true to the restaurant's moniker) stops to make you think. Dinner might begin with blanquette de veau, tender, perfectly cooked veal in a mouthwatering white sauce, surrounded by a lovely jardinière of vegetables and served with fragrant white rice. And then finish with a luscious crêpe Suzette, laced with a delicious caramel-orange drizzle and scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream.",0,0
124,Schiller's Liquor Bar,American,2,"In business for over a decade, this fantastically retro city favorite still buzzes with cool crowds and tasty American comfort food-thanks to a focused and skilled kitchen. Plunked on prime Lower East Side real estate, the commanding bistro's white-tile exterior, black- and white-tiled floor, and wrought-iron doors invite groups of friends for cocktails and $1 oyster happy hour at the curved bar. While the libations aren't standout, they are a nice complement to tried-and-true classics like braised pork tacos folded with pineapple, tomatillos, pickled red onion, and lime crema with a devilish salsa habanera. A braised brisket patty melt with a decadent blend of pepper jack, mustard, and balsamic onions is as faultless as a tart and refreshing Key lime pie.",0,0
125,Market Table,American,2,"Think of this bright little corner as the template for a perfect neighborhood restaurant-one that everyone dreams of having nearby. The vibe is unpretentious yet cool, with a young, attentive service staff. The windowed room feels barnyard-chic, with a chalkboard wall listing wine and cheese offerings beneath reclaimed ceiling beams. The menu is stocked with the kind of dishes that never disappoint-think bucatini tossed with fried eggplant and creamy burrata in a chunky tomato sauce. The kitchen's knack for making simple food vivid is clear in the impeccably cooked strip loin, served with carrots, haricots verts, and shishitos brought together with smoked chili ""pesto."" The Clam, an equally delicious and seafood-focused sibling, is located a few blocks away.",0,0
126,BONDST,Japanese,3,"There's no denying that BONDST is still trendy after all these years; it even manages to stay sexy with sheer fabric panels, wispy tree branches, dark leathers, and private spaces. The three-story interior fills nightly with a very European crowd. (Romantics head downstairs; Bacchanalians go up.) High quality fusion dishes may seem more crowd-pleasing than inventive, but are nonetheless delicious. Behind the wood sushi bar, the buzzing kitchen rolls mountains of maki, like paper-thin slices of pristine scallops balanced with a thick soy-jalapeño sauce and yuzu kosho. The soba nomi ""risotto"" is a wickedly rich and unmissable dish of glistening buckwheat soba folded with trout butter, king crab, and shrimp beneath a thatch of bonito flakes and gold paper.",0,0
127,Joe & MissesDoe,Contemporary,2,"Chef Joe and Jill Doe have revamped their earnest establishment with a tweaked menu and pared down interior look. Gone are the knickknacks that were previously sprinkled throughout this small room, which now seats about 30 at a single row of tables and long bar counter. From his station in the open kitchen, the chef gives American cuisine a creative re-working. Broccoli meets skordalia in an appetizer of caramelized florets dressed with grated pecorino, sliced almonds, pistachios, and toasted garlic. Beef brisket is slow-braised then griddled, and plated with house-made steak sauce and spicy radish chow-chow. A sundae of chocolate chip banana bread with vanilla ice cream and bananas Foster sauce is yet another example of this enjoyable hybrid cuisine.",0,0
128,Bar Primi,Italian,2,"Chef Andrew Carmellini has added this pasta-centric trattoria to his clutch of inspired operations. A tomato-red awning highlights the two-floor space designed by Taavo Somer, which features whitewashed brick walls, tawny leather banquettes, and a communal table topped with terra-cotta pots of greenery. Bensonhurst-native Chef Sal Lamboglia uses first rate ingredients to produce two categories of toothsome strands and shapes. Traditional preparations bring the likes of bucatini with lamb all'Amatriciana; while seasonal inspiration includes fiore di carciofi, a coiled tube of artichoke cream, dressed with diced fatty bacon and pecorino. The menu is bolstered by small plates like fontina-stuffed meatballs in a thick sugo as well as rotating daily specials.",0,0
129,Dirty French,French,3,"Dirty French is Major Food Group's stab at a hotel restaurant-and what a theatrical, charismatic stab it is. Settled in the Ludlow Hotel, this space shares the neighborhood's irreverent attitude, from the pink neon signs at the door to the casual kicks on the hipster waiters. Tables are tightly packed and lively conversations drown out funky music. This truly unique restaurant designs French-inspired bistro fare with colonial meanderings. Start off with fluffy flatbread slathered with fromage blanc. Then, sample the exquisitely executed mille-feuille of trumpet mushrooms in a verdant pool of green curry with pickled hot peppers. Duck à l'orange has crackling-crisp skin and tender meat alongside rice pilaf topped with crunchy shallots.",0,0
130,Prune,American,2,"Chef Gabrielle Hamilton's sterling little bistro has long bewitched the city's foodies who cram its bar and row of tables. Unpretentious cooking in a room branded by pops of purple is Prune's hallmark, and a completely revised menu shines with newfound inspiration. ""Straw and hay"" pasta-fresh strands of egg and herbed linguine-is sauced with chicken livers and diced green tomatoes, while deep-fried rabbit is seasoned with romesco salt, and sided with buttermilk dressing. For the most simple yet epic finale ever, the season's best peaches are lightly sugared and laid over warm buttered toast. Prune's daiquiri (a zesty combination of three rums garnished with a vanilla bean swizzle stick that perfumes each sip) is proof of serious cocktail creativity.",0,0
131,Yopparai,Japanese,3,"Buzzing into Yopparai is like waltzing into culinary wonder. Secluded above street level, the attentive staff and cozy vibe alone make this Japanese haven a must. Same for the food, which adds immense thrill to the equation. From the homemade natto or amazing, artisanal udon, to the unparalleled flavor from tofu, each dish features a plethora of intricately prepared parts that unite perfectly. While their items are consistently appealing, standouts include inaniwa udon, set in a shallow pool of cool dashi topped with thin slices of chicken, tomato, cucumber, and nori accompanied by peanut sauce. The smooth and custardy yodoufu is a revelation served warm in a wooden box. For extra sake fun, drop by Azasu, a group-friendly delight from the same team.",0,0
132,Noodle Pudding,Italian,2,"With Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra rotating on the playlist and a dark wood bar full of regulars, Noodle Pudding embodies all the essential qualities of a winning neighborhood spot. It's the type of place to kick back and relax, dine on consistently good food, and even sit solo but never feel ""alone."" The kitchen has mastered Italian-American classics, with honest ingredients and great preparation, like the balance of acidic and sweet components in the gently poached cod Livornese. The tantalizing eggy-cheesy, slightly smoky-sweet, and creamy carbonara that bathes toothsome mezze rigatoni, fava beans, and tiny pork sausage meatballs is ""dyno-mite."" Top it all off with the exemplary (and shareable) house-made cheesecake and a perfect shot of espresso.",0,0
133,EN Japanese Brasserie,Japanese,3,"EN doesn't pander to the spicy tuna-loving set, but effectively pays homage to highly seasonal Japanese cooking. In such simple and delicate food, flawless execution is a must so don't be hesitant to ask for a recommendation. The knowledgeable and genuine servers are happy to offer their opinion on items, be it the ground Kurobuta pork mixed with natto; or gently fried agedashi tofu floating in a thick, glossy dashi with mushrooms. Silken chawanmushi in a glazed stone cup is paired with kernels of charred corn for a delightful bit of bite, while Aburi sea trout is fanned sashimi-style across a striking onyx plate. Lofty ceilings, large windows, and a glass wall lined with shelves of sake attract a young, professional, and fashionable clientele.",0,0
134,Piora,Contemporary,3,"The West Village's impossibly quaint charm gets even more charming with an elegant dinner for two at beautiful Piora. The setting is polished, upscale and cozy, with a marble bar up front teeming with well-heeled beauties sipping cocktails; and a sleek white dining room in the back, featuring a stunning wall of glass overlooking a lush urban garden. It's a soothing experience from the start, a chance to sit back and sink into a perfectly prepared drink (don't miss the creative libations) and let the hustle of the city slough off as you consider the neighborhood's manicured charms. The polished staff together with elegantly prepared and very contemporary cuisine-carefully presented and borrowing from the many influences of Piora's Korean-born owner and Italian-American chef-only seal the deal. Take the perfectly al dente rigatoni, plated with savory crumbles of ground lamb-and-pork sausage and laced with dollops of bright green nettle pesto, jalapeño slivers, and shaved pecorino; or a beautifully prepared Four Story Hill Farm poularde, rendered to juicy, crispy perfection, and garnished with tawny sweet potato, pickled mustard seeds, tender Brussels sprouts, and foie gras foam.",1,1
135,Acme,Contemporary,2,"NoHo is no stranger to Vogue-ready waitresses, but Acme's reincarnation two years ago produced an inventive Nordic culinary nirvana, equal parts rustic brasserie and sultry lounge. Naturally, the crowds came and never left its metal-topped bar and pine-green banquettes. One could stare at the gorgeously lit backdrop of bottles, but grab a Foxy Brown and contemplate the innovative menu. Chef Mads Refslund brings his Danish sensibility to many dishes, including lightly cured mackerel finished with grated horseradish. But he also leaves room for comforting fusion dishes like Johnny Cakes-an American classic-turned-fun ensemble of thin cornbread flapjacks, accompanied by sweet, porky confit, as well as an assortment of crispy pig ears and pickled veggies.",0,0
136,Minetta Tavern,Gastropub,3,"While this 1937 setting has been restored and refreshed, nothing here changes and that is its beauty. This quintessential New York tavern is still surrounded by dark wood, checkerboard tiled floors, and those framed caricatures. The astute service team handles the crowds and energy as well as ever-they even don the same white-aproned livery seen in Mad Men. It's that kind of place. The menu's dedication to bistro classics and New York steakhouse fare ensure its continued longevity. A thick slice of their mosaic-like terrine of oxtail, poached leek, and carrot surrounding a foie gras center is timelessly good. Those warm platters of juicy, tender, appetizingly charred New York strip steaks propped up against a bouquet of peppery watercress shine with simple, perfect flavor. An oval cast-iron pan of slow-cooked pork shank is rendered tender, luscious, and dark as a prune. Piping-hot pommes aligot are just what mashed potatoes were always meant to be: cheesy, creamy, and obscenely decadent. Velvety bittersweet chocolate soufflés and towering wedges of bright white coconut cakes stacked with three layers of pastry cream, tart crème fraîche, and coconut shavings are brazen crowd-pleasers.",1,1
137,Vics,Italian,2,"The eatery formerly known as Five Points has been reinvented as an Italian-leaning restaurant complete with exposed brick walls and the requisite red pizza oven. Though the dining room is bright and airy, a notable bar program-especially in Italian inflections such as homemade limoncello-prove there's more to this joint than meets the eye. The best bites are unfussy updates of familiar dishes, such as rye rigatoni with rich braised lamb, fragrant torn oregano, and a sprinkling of sharp cheese. A silky, satisfying nest of cacio e pepe is heavy on the black pepper and nutty pecorino, and that red pizza oven produces thin, crisp pies topped with tomato, basil, and sharp pecorino. For dessert, a bomboloni of ricotta and chocolate is worth the splurge.",0,0
138,Katz's,Deli,1,"One of the last-standing, old-time Eastern European spots on the Lower East Side, Katz's is a true NY institution. It's crowded, crazy, and packed with a panoply of characters weirder than a jury duty pool. Tourists, hipsters, blue hairs, and everybody in between flock here, so come on off-hours. Because it's really that good. Walk inside, get a ticket, and don't lose it (those guys at the front aren't hosts-upset their system and you'll get a verbal beating). Then get your food at the counter and bring it to a first-come first-get table; or opt for a slightly less dizzying experience at a waitress-served table. Nothing's changed in the looks or taste. Matzo ball soup, pastrami sandwiches, potato latkes-everything is what you'd expect, only better.",0,0
139,Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria,Italian,2,"This is the kind of cooking and scene that makes us all wish we were Italian. Start with a stroll through the alimentari (located up front) to grab some pickled beans and serious cheeses. Then move on to the rustic dining area upstairs, which oozes warmth and comfort. Note the meticulously conceived copper roof, open kitchen, and other decorative accents that set a picturesque backdrop for a delicious meal. The food here is authoritative and tasty, with a nice representation of Italian cooking from breakfast through dinner. The porchetta panino is timeless, amazing, and vies to be the finest around. Skillfully crafted homemade pasta includes textbook-perfect bucatini cacio e pepe. Finish with an affogato, topping a scoop of vanilla gelato with hot espresso.",0,0
140,Lil' Frankie's,Italian,1,"Frank Prisinzano's pizzeria combines a series of intimate rooms for a laid-back vibe that's perfectly in step with the neighborhood. An open kitchen is in one room, a pizza oven in another, and a third boasts a wall of window panels that open for alfresco dining. Framed photos and colorful vinyl tablecloths add character. The Neapolitan-style pizza is always a hit, perhaps topped with bright tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and slices of spicy salami. Also savor the likes of fava bean purée with dandelion greens for a thick and homey soup. Garlic bread, baked pasta of the day, and whole eggplant with pepperoncino oil are all flame-kissed creations from the wood-burning oven. Stop by during weekend brunch for ""killer"" pancakes made with buckwheat flour.",0,0
141,Yunnan Kitchen,Chinese,2,"The Lower East Side is awash in delicious Asian food, but Yunnan Kitchen, which aims its sights on the delicate, refreshingly diverse cuisine of the Yunnan region, sets itself apart from the pack. Beautiful trinkets like heirloom necklaces and tiger print rugs, carefully gathered from owner Erika Chou's travels, line the walls of this communal eatery and provide the perfect exotic backdrop for the kitchen's subtle, unique dishes. A pomelo salad arrives in juicy little clusters over chrysanthemum greens with deep-fried shallots; while impossibly moist shao kao lamb is skewered, then barbecued to spicy perfection with red chili pepper. Fresh red snapper served over a springy pile of sweet potato noodles laced in Sichuan peppercorn oil makes for a fine finale.",0,0
142,Lafayette,French,2,"Chef Andrew Carmellini's homage to French cuisine lures patrons inside with its attractive baked-goods counter up front lined with organic breads and tempting pastries. From here, the room unfolds into a series of seductive spaces where one finds a rotisserie oven spinning bronzed birds, a backlit bar with an amber glow, and columns clad in warm honey and blue tile. The cooking is nothing short of stellar, right from that Niçoise salad with thick slices of rare tuna, briny black olives, barely poached green beans, soft potatoes, and hard-boiled egg, to a local fillet of trout finished with mustard sauce and well-dressed frisée salad. Desserts are borderline irresistible, especially the mille-feuille Lafayette with chocolate cremeux and caramel-poached pear.",0,0
143,Perla,Italian,2,"This rustic little Minetta Lane charmer is packed to the gills most nights of the week, but it comes by its popularity honestly. The ingredients are all in place: a stylish interior; a genuinely likable staff; an unfussy menu with well-sourced ingredients and detailed execution. What's not to love here? Fresh from a face-lift, Perla now offers four different family-style dishes, serving multiple people at reasonable price points. Other menu highlights include plump Mediterranean sardines in a tomato sauce, pocked with tender braised tripe, salty black olives and fennel; a near-perfect rendition of bucatini cacio e pepe; and a succulent roast pork sndawich, fragrant with fennel seeds, and served with layers of garlicky broccoli rabe, giardiniera, and provolone.",0,0
144,Hecho en Dumbo,Mexican,2,"Sitting towards the top of NYC's rapidly improving Mexican food scene is Chef and Mexico City native Daniel Mena's spirited cantina. Venture through the exposed brick, salvaged wood, classically downtown dining room to peek at the open kitchen and counter where the tasting menu is offered (to those who reserve in advance). A trio of excellent salsas and warm tortilla chips is a mouthwatering beginning to this authentic cooking. Indulge in a hearty, alder wood-smoked feast for two in the parillada Yucateca, featuring a gnaw-worthy Berkshire pork chop and 14-day dry-aged NY strip with warm Edam cheese topped in olives, capers, and puréed almonds. Mexican traditions shine in cinnamon-infused capirotada bread pudding with coconut crème anglaise.",0,0
145,Balvanera,Argentinian,2,"A balanced taste of Argentina is the centerpiece of this lively bistro, which is a destination for beautifully marbled, expertly grilled meats and super-fresh veggies. Service is attentive and free of attitude in a neighborhood where this is all too common, and whitewashed brick walls alongside tightly packed wooden tables highlight the low key, welcoming scene. Balvanera's versatile menu is designed for sharing, from the authentically flaky empanadas with a zippy chimichurri to succulent house-made chorizo, served simply with a slice of smoky roasted red pepper. Meats are a must, including the dry-aged, grilled bone-in rib eye, garnished with crisp watercress. To balance all that meat, dig into sweet roasted carrots with frisée, orange, and pepitas.",0,0
146,Aroma Kitchen & Wine Bar,Italian,2,"When dolled-up crowds pack this cobblestoned street, the staff rises to the occasion with true Italian hospitality. Despite the trendy surrounds, authenticity is paramount as orange-framed doors are flung open to reveal lovely rustic rooms and a quiet, contemporary aura. The front area presents mirrors, a wood bar, and hefty shelves of interesting wines. Beyond brick archways, a communal table in the dining room is ideal for savoring summer's bounty beautifully showcased in scafata di verdure, a zuppa bobbing with quadrettini dressed in a bright vegetable ragù. Flavorful bites of strascinati are tossed with sublime Moliterno cheese, lamb sausage, and smoky red peppers. A scoop of stracciatella gelato or the daily sorbetto ensures an exalted finish.",0,0
147,Sociale,Italian,2,"Although the name evokes a swinging place with cocktails and conversation, Sociale proves much more than a neighborhood social club. With true Italian hospitality and a cozy corner location across from a throw-back cinema, Sociale has become the Brooklyn Heights spot to spend a lively Friday night. Regulars wedge up to the bar for glasses of mineral-rich Italian whites or crowd into a charming, lair-like dining room, where the table inches away from yours may host your newest companion. The menu sticks to classics, with perfectly cooked spaghetti in fresh and chunky pomodoro sauce; or veal loin wrapped in pancetta and drizzled with great veal jus. Come dessert, the banana and date bread pudding with Guinness gelato is absolutely delicious.",0,0
148,Murray's Cheese Bar,American,2,"A turophile's dream come true, this cheese bar is built for people who just want to eat really amazing cheese. The upscale space, decked with subway tiles, whitewashed wood tables, and lacquered chairs, is a natural extension of neighboring Murray's Cheese, the famed Greenwich Village purveyor of phenomenal dairy products. With a category to suit every craving (fresh, soft-ripened, washed-rind, semi-firm, and blue) the bar's extensive menu has it all, from buttery Pyrénéese Brebis to funky and heady gorgonzola cremificato. For a truly indulgent meal, add a glass of wine (nebbiolo with that rich gorgonzola), salumi (from American purveyors like D'Artagnan and Olli), slow-simmered lamb meatballs, and phenomenal cheeses served with sweet apricot compote.",0,0
149,Takashi,Japanese,2,"Tremendous care, planning, and sourcing of specialty cuts went into cozy Takashi before it ever opened its doors to acclaim. Chef/owner Takashi Inoue honors his Korean ancestry and Osaka upbringing with an array of shamelessly carnivorous yakiniku favorites. Walls display cutesy cartoons to clarify exactly what you are eating-like ""testicargot."" Creative starters might include the Fashion Week Special, served as a cuffed paper bag of devilishly good collagen chips scented with hibiscus and blood orange. Tables are equipped with gas grills for searing platters of rare cuts, from tender beef cheek to large intestines and every stomach in between. Don't miss homemade desserts, like Madagascar vanilla soft-serve with rice dumplings and salted caramel sauce.",0,0
150,The Black Ant,Mexican,2,"Bringing a dose of Mexico City chic to the East Village, this restaurant takes its name from the ancient Mesoamerican fable of an ant and incorporates that imagery throughout the setting. Black and white checkerboard flooring, blackboard wall tiles bearing white ants, and a very cool giant ant mural reinforce the theme. The menu is an unrestricted look at Mexican cuisine. It is only fitting that specialties here include the Climbing Ant cocktail combining tequila, Aperol, and mole bitters; freshly-mashed guacamole seasoned with crushed ant salt; and grasshopper-crusted shrimp tacos. Insect-free creations are just as appealing, as in tacos stuffing tender masa tortillas with large chunks of battered and fried cod cheek, aïoli, and cabbage-mango slaw.",0,0
151,Baker & Co.,Italian,2,"The latest brainchild of the team behind the wildly popular Emporio, brand-new Baker & Co. makes a big mark on NYC's Italian-American scene. From the exposed brick walls and wood-lined banquettes to the backyard garden and Faema espresso machine, the rustic, honest restaurant feels comfortable enough to spread out pappardelle with veal cheek ragù and seasonal daily specials like watermelon gazpacho. A rich, sweet soup spiked with tomatoes, it bobs with lumps of crabmeat and cooling cucumber. The menu, though, leans more toward traditional Italian dishes. Dig into the braised rabbit meatballs, paired with shaved ricotta and tonnato-style aïoli, as well as garganelli bathed in a saffron brodetto and topped with peekytoe crab accompanied by bottarga.",0,0
152,Pearl Oyster Bar,Seafood,2,"It's not hard to find a lobster roll in this city, and for that we can thank Rebecca Charles. This seafood institution-inspired by Charles' childhood summers spent in Maine-has been stuffing sweet lobster meat into split-top rolls since 1997. The two-room setting offers a choice: counter seating or table service. Wood furnishings and white walls are low-key; beachy memorabilia perks up the space. Start the meal by slurping your way through a classic chilled shellfish platter before tucking into that signature lobster roll, served alongside a tower of shoestring fries. The kitchen shines in daily specials, too, such as the grilled lobster served with corn pudding or pan-roasted wild bass. A hot fudge sundae is an appropriately nostalgic finish.",0,0
153,Pó,Italian,2,"Sometimes the best design begins with a simple and humble concept. Case in point: Po', a lovely spot with a cozy ambience; good wine list; charming staff; and excellent Italian food. By day, the narrow space feels open and airy-especially in summer, when they prop the windows open and ceiling fans swirl lazily overhead. Come nightfall, it's a date night dream, with low lighting and an old-fashioned romantic vibe. Get your night started with polpette di carne, a trio of silky meatballs braised in tomato sauce with caciocavallo and a thatch of fresh herbs. And then move on to a tangle of spinach tagliatelle with a rich ragù alla bolognese; or a succulent grilled pork chop, served over tender braised cabbage, with a pear-and-cranberry mostarda.",0,0
154,Sushi Nakazawa,Japanese,4,"This is a typical NY destination, right down to the tough reservation. The calm setting contrasts the buzz surrounding Chef Daisuke Nakazawa. That hype means the place operates at its own pace; and your meal depends on where you sit-the counter offers fresh, meticulously prepared sushi and engaging chefs, while the dining room is steerage with apathetic servers doling out mediocre pieces of sushi all at once. But, this kitchen is stocked with the best of America's waters. Uni from Maine is beautifully prepared and notable thanks to hay-smoked bonito. Then, expect a live scallop, pearly and sweet, with just a hint of yuzu pepper paste. And, that Florida tiger prawn could not be more fresh or enjoyable as it is knifed and shelled. For dessert, the lychee sorbet is ace.",0,0
155,Kesté Pizza & Vino,Pizza,1,"A runaway success since day one, Kesté takes the craft of making Neapolitan-style pizza to epic heights. Pizzaiolo Roberto Caporuscio first opened and established Kesté's reputation, even though he has now handed over this custom-built, wood-fired, volcanic stone forno to his very capable daughter, Giorgia. Pizzas may be listed under two headings, but every pie (including gluten-free) is built upon a nicely salted, faintly tangy, gorgeously puffy crust with a delicately charred cornicione. Pizza speciale feature creative ingredients like pistachio pesto or butternut squash purée; while pizze rosse are topped with excellent homemade mozzarella, imported tomatoes, and an array of meat or vegetables. Weekday lunches showcase panini.",0,0
156,Le Gigot,French,2,"As classically beautiful and intricate as the Metro signs of Paris, this petitresto is dedicated to honoring The City of Light. Modeled after the Left Bank bistro Polidor, the iconic interior features parquet floors, zinc-topped tables, and antique mirrored walls. The room fills quickly with regulars; the dedicated staff graciously greets most by name. The food is equally beloved, with such classics as generous charcuterie platters that include sausage, duck rillettes, silky smooth chicken liver, and hearty country pâtés. The excellent boeuf Bourguignon is a comforting dish of braised beef cubes, carrots, potatoes, button mushrooms, sweet shallots, and plenty of bacon. Come dessert, tarte Tatin smells of apples and heaven (but with extra butter).",0,0
157,Ivan Ramen,Japanese,2,"This delicious little ramen-ya couldn't have landed on a more fitting spot. It may appear rough around the edges, but the ultra-hip 'hood and its affinity for indie rock beats fit Ivan's scene to a tee. Then consider their sweet staff gliding within the snug space filled with packed seats and realize how serious a treat this is. Solo diners head to the counter for a view of the action-packed kitchen, while others look for a seat from which to admire that mural of manga cutouts. Find them launching into pickled daikon with XO sauce and sesame seeds for a 'lil crunch and whole 'lotta flavor. Displaying a flare for non-traditional ingredients, paitan ramen with tender chicken confit in a chicken-and-kombu broth makes for a singular, savory, and tasty highlight.",0,0
158,Thelma on Clinton,American,2,"With its cozy bistro décor and sincere, down-to-earth service, Thelma on Clinton is the kind of unpretentious restaurant everyone wants around the corner from home. Owner Melissa O'Donnell is a longtime fixture on New York's restaurant scene, and Thelma is her latest contribution-this time, in her old Salt Bar space. Does she kill it? She kills it: and she might just get double credit for producing such delicious fare in a kitchen smaller than some local apartment kitchens. Kick things off with the scrumptious bacon-wrapped dates, laced in a irresistible, sticky maple sauce. Then move on to tender spring pea and asparagus risotto with plump peas, crunchy asparagus and Grana Padano cheese; or olive oil-poached codfish in a lovely citrus sauce.",0,0
159,Wasan,Japanese,2,"The Tokyo-born team of Chef Ryota Kitagawa and Kakusaburo Sakurai both spent time in the kitchen of the Waldorf-Astoria's pioneering Inagiku. Their pedigree is evident in this intimate room, offering excellent food and service. A unique rendition of Japanese cooking includes the house salad of lettuces, radish, seaweed and slivered chayote presented in a delicately crisp, edible bowl made from wheat and corn flour. The ingredients are tossed at the table, resulting in a lovely presentation that's strewn with crisped bits. Delightful house-pickled vegetables include salt-pickled Napa cabbage, sweet-and-sour shavings of watermelon radish, and Brussels sprouts in curry vinegar. And with its foundation of hijiki seaweed rice, the lush unagi bowl is a treat.",0,0
160,Pagani,Italian,2,"With witty cocktails, cured meats, and rustico nuovo décor, Pagani brings an extra dose of Italian charm to Bleecker Street, and a good one at that. Flauting a vibrant scene of locals guzzling indigenous Italian wines and Averna-steeped drinks, this brainchild of Massimo Lusardi targets a younger brood where authenticity and creativity go hand-in-hand. His family may own several other restaurants, but sizeable portions of house-made pasta with updated embellishments (think: montasio cheese topping a decadent ragù of veal and pork) highlight balance and excellence. Just as veal shoulder arrives unbelievably fragrant and tender with herb-rubbed, toasted bread; rigatoni with braised rabbit and sweet carrots feel like a match made in culinary heaven.",0,0
161,The Little Owl,American,2,"Perched on a winsome corner of the West Village, Chef Joey Campanaro's The Little Owl continues to hold a dear place in the hearts of diners near and far who appreciate that simple food and great food can be one and the same. The broccoli soup (a pure, silky purée enriched with a trace of cream and crowned by a crouton of bubbling, aged cheddar) is among the best examples of this. The small corner room is quaint and despite this establishment's popularity, the service team is completely attitude-free. The wee kitchen is on display, and the focused crew turns out a rousing roster of preparations that may bear an affinity for Mediterranean cuisine such as seared cod with bagna cauda vinaigrette, and gravy meatball sliders, a hands-down house specialty.",0,0
162,Supper,Italian,2,"Laid-back yet lively, this Italian paradise draws a refined crowd looking to while away a few lazy hours over great wine and even better bites. Seats up front offer prime views of an action-packed kitchen, while the back is best for intimacy and more sips from the impressive list. Fresh, thinly sliced squid quickly tossed in garlic, olive oil, lemon, parsley, and chili flakes is a study in the powers of simplicity; while strozzapretti with ""Dad's Sunday Marinara Sauce"" is an elevated rendition of the classic-finished with a mound of luscious ricotta. Even the plainest of pastas are enviably enriched here-imagine twirls of spaghetti al limone with a mountain of parmesan and black pepper. If you can save room, the tiramisu is light, fluffy, and molto buono!",0,0
163,Narcissa,Contemporary,2,"André Balaz's Standard East Village hotel is where you will find one of downtown's snazziest dining rooms. Richly stained wood furnishings in contrasting hues pair beautifully with tanned leather banquettes, sienna table linens, and perfectly calibrated lighting. The overall effect is warmer than a Malibu sunset. Chef John Fraser (of Dovetail) has assembled a formidable team to realize his vision of polished farm-to-table dining, starring seasonal produce from the Hudson Valley. Beets take a turn in the rotisserie oven and arrive for your pleasure as a warm salad with hearty bulgur, pickled cucumber, and a pool of horseradish cream. Poussin is roasted whole and set atop steel cut oats slicked with jus, spicy sausage, and oven-wilted radicchio.",0,0
164,Las Ramblas,Spanish,1,"Sandwiched among a throng of attention-seeking storefronts, mighty little Las Ramblas is easy to spot, just look for the crowd of happy, munching faces. The scene spills out onto the sidewalk when the weather allows. Named for Barcelona's historic commercial thoroughfare, Las Ramblas is a tapas treat. A copper-plated bar and collection of tiny tables provide a perch for snacking on an array of earnestly prepared items. Check out the wall-mounted blackboard for especiales. Bring friends (it's that kind of place) to fully explore the menu which serves up delights such as succulent head-on prawns roasted in a terra-cotta dish and sauced with cava vinegar, ginger, and basil; or béchamel creamed spinach topped by a molten cap of Mahón cheese.",0,0
165,Jewel Bako,Japanese,3,"Black walls surrounding two tiny windows form the façade of this surreptitious gem. Unlike the diverse neighborhood in which it resides, the décor inside the long room is simple and sleek, framed by low ceilings, curving bamboo slats, and close-knit tables. Servers are smartly attired if a little too-cool-for-school, but the passionate chefs here provide a wealth of culinary entertainment. This is a place where painstaking detail is evident from start to finish. A large square plate, for instance, may feature the likes of ruby-red tuna set beside soy-mirin sauce; an edible cup filled with a spicy salmon mixture; densely packed roe topped with bonito flakes; and a peppery watercress salad. Then, a thick cut of salmon marinated in three types of miso and cooked en papillote is unwrapped to reveal the most tender, moist, and flaky meat. And finally, each grain of slightly sticky rice in the sushi omakase is cooked perfectly and combined with fluke, Tasmanian trout, and creamy otoro. Young couples as well as die-hard downtowners idolize this ""jewel"" and for good reason-a dessert of green tea ice cream sandwiched between chocolate chip cookies is exemplary, delicious, and very, very special.",1,1
166,Degustation,Spanish,2,"With its slate-tiled walls and cozy lighting, this well-loved tapas bar is of the most elegant degree-and a romantic escape from the fray for couples on date night. Counter seating surrounds the spotless and very serious kitchen of Chef Nicholas Licata, and dapper proprietor Jack Lamb is a colorful presence. The skillfully rendered and enticingly presented small plates are ever-evolving. Expect hot and crunchy croquetas oozing with mushroom-infused cream; or zesty boquerones dressed with yuzu peel and breadcrumbs. Sunchokes are roasted whole and sent forth with pumpernickel ""soil"" and an addictive mound of ""funyons."" For a fantastic finale, cubes of seared pineapple are composed with white chocolate sponge cake and intensely green lime granita.",0,0
167,Clinton St. Baking Company,American,1,"What started as a bakery has become a legend-one that perpetually draws a crowd waiting for ample rewards. A little bit country and a little bit food lab, this brunch-focused bijou has achieved such success in NY that the owners now have outposts in Japan and Dubai. Service can struggle to keep up with the crowds, but the loud and lively dining room doesn't seem to notice. Breakfast for dinner is always a treat, especially when golden brown Belgian waffles are served with warm maple butter and topped with buttermilk-brined fried chicken for a flawless marriage of sweet and savory. Lighter but still lovely, chicken tortilla soup sees a pile of crunchy fried tortilla strips over hearty broth bobbing with carrots, celery, and shredded chicken.",0,0
168,Risotteria Melotti,Italian,2,"By specializing in risotto, this unique family-owned spot rises above the city's endless proliferation of Italian dining options. The Melotti family produces rice in Veneto and this stateside location is sister to Isola della Scala in Verona. Scenes from the film Riso Amaro on a mounted television add atmosphere to the rustic surrounds, where the air is filled with the sounds of stirring as each order is prepared. A bread basket stuffed with rice cakes precedes plates of risotto limone e gamberi made with lemon juice and studded with morsels of pan-seared shrimp. More complex risotti may be presented in a crispy Monte Veronese cheese cup and showcase Amarone wine. Here, each creamy and toothsome grain displays impressive technique.",0,0
169,Perilla,Contemporary,2,"Low-key, casual, and classic, Perilla is simply a comfortable place to be-solo diners seek out the welcoming bar. Observe that the designer zebrawood tables are signed on the edge and then understand this place's level of care and dedication to detail. The subdued lighting, plush banquettes, and cream-colored walls lend a calm vibe despite the clubby music. The kitchen combines quality ingredients with experimental flair, resulting in dishes that are pleasing but sometimes overly complex. Sample pastas like house-made garganelli with smoky guanciale, paprika, spring onion, piney-crunchy fiddlehead fern, and sweet octopus. The Long Island duck breast is cooked to gorgeous pink and served with roasted beets and savory baklava layering duck confit and greens.",0,0
170,Buvette,French,2,"Charming and proudly French, Buvette serves delicious Gallic plates to a notably svelte set. While carb addicts can barely fit into these wee seats, it's worth the squeeze for Chef Jody Williams' famously rustic cooking. Inside, everything comes alive with jazz and chatter. Instagrammable dishes take their cue from French classics and may feature crusty olive oil-drizzled country bread slathered with fluffy scrambled eggs, salty prosciutto, and nutty parmesan. Then await croissants-fresh, buttery, and flaky-served with sweet fruit preserves for a typically French and very decadent treat. If not up the block at her other spot or across the pond in Paris, you may even find the chef herself holding meetings over a potent, frothy, and flawless cappuccino.",0,0
171,Tertulia,Spanish,2,"With a Spanish soul and tastefully raw space, Chef Seamus Mullen's Tertulia is big-hearted and boasts a surprisingly healthy side to its menu. The narrow room decked with a long wood bar and colorful tiles evokes those casual eateries in Spain, rife with a buzzing open kitchen and chalkboards scribbled with cheeses. The bites here are healthy but equally bright with flavor. Tosta matrimonio is a flax and quinoa crisp topped with black and white anchovies, slow-roasted tomato, and sharp sheep's milk cheese. Also, try bocata de delicata, a satisfying sandwich of slices of charred delicata squash, roasted red peppers, Swiss chard, and cheddar cheese. For rotisserie fun or a perfect rib eye to grill on your rooftop, visit El Colmado Butchery in MePa.",0,0
172,Soto,Japanese,3,"Culinary dominance, unmistakable skill, and absolute discipline permeate every angle of this modest storefront. This is not some flashy temple to sushi, but rather an authentic and visually restrained rendering of a traditional Japanese restaurant. If the sterile look (with just blonde wood and bright lights to embellish) seems too antiseptic, then remember that Soto prides itself on precise preparations of luxurious raw seafood. While operational issues combined with lackluster service may have impacted guests' experiences of late, the cuisine of Chef Sotohiro Kosugi remains extraordinary-as long as you can tune out the flaws. Knife skills are paramount and every element is at its precise temperature, as these adept cooks coax each morsel of impossibly rich uni, served simply with uni powder, into a single bite that leaves a lasting impression. Composed dishes are not only strikingly beautiful, but an outright hit-imagine finely chopped and exceedingly silken toro tartare with avocado coulis, caviar, and chives accompanied by a sesame-ponzu sauce. And, unctuous fresh water eel combined with Tosa vinegar, smoky bonito flakes, and crisp Japanese cucumbers come together to form a neat but umami-rich finish.",2,1
173,Sobakoh,Japanese,1,"Before entering Sobakoh, stop for a minute to appreciate Chef/owner Hiromitsu Takahashi, sequestered in his temperature- and humidity-controlled glass booth, forming layers of organically grown buckwheat flour dough into first-rate noodles. This ritual is performed several times daily by the smiling chef and is the foundation of the seasonally arranged offerings at this Japan-meets-East Village soba spot. Service can be sluggish, so start with a classic snack, like the refreshing daikon salad dressed with yuzu, wasabi, and bonito flakes. Then dive into your bowlful of uni ikura soba- chilled buckwheat noodles heaped with creamy sea urchin and plump salmon roe. The inexpensive prix-fixe offered nightly is even cheaper before 7:00 P.M.",0,0
174,annisa,Fusion,3,"Anita Lo's menu is informed by her heritage and her peregrinations, and she clearly puts much effort into seeking out the best seasonal produce available. The Asian element of the fusion equation is quite pronounced yet there is also plenty of choice for those who prefer their influences to come from more Westerly cuisines. As a result, one can start with black sea bass sashimi with trout roe and follow it up, by way of contrast, with a ""tasting of lamb"" with cauliflower. Dishes are quite delicate creations and come with some flavor combinations that will certainly perk up your taste buds. The dining room exudes warmth; the service is self-assured and, given that annisa means ""women"" in Arabic, it is fitting that the wine list makes a point of featuring many female wine growers.",0,0
175,Blue Hill,American,2,"Chef Dan Barber's iconic venue remains the paragon of farm-to-table dining in Manhattan by virtue of its seasonal lineup of pampered product. Everything on the menu is sourced from the Stone Barns Center (home to Blue Hill's Westchester farm) as well as a number of local producers. Blue Hill's intimate space has been hosting a devoted foodie following for an impressive 15-some years, and service in this former speakeasy-where fresh flowers and candlelight cast a romantic spell-is nothing less than excellent. The adept kitchen turns out contemporary cuisine, which in turn showcases the astounding quality stocked in the larder and allows vegetables to shine at all times. Asparagus spears are gently roasted to preserve their natural earthiness and coupled with vibrant beet yogurt as well as stinging nettles cream for a perfect balance in flavor. Then, moist striped bass draped atop fennel purée is decked with soft, sweet currants and toasted salty pine nuts to form a succulent and satisfying entrée. Familiar desserts highlight still more of the kitchen's best, as is the case with light and custard-y brioche bread pudding coupled with a quenelle of pleasantly bitter cocoa nib cream.",1,1
176,Rockmeisha,Japanese,1,"Tightly-packed bar height tables fill this tiny izakaya-style restaurant, a quirky canteen with a menu designed for fun. The young crowd sips Sapporo or sake against a soundtrack of old school rock; and the décor, not far behind, ranges from vinyl records to a framed beer ad featuring Japanese women in bathing suits. The space is cramped yet fun, the atmosphere lively and loose. An appropriately moist leek omelet shows the kitchen's deft execution of simple dishes. Meaty, deep-fried chicken wings coated in a nose-tingling vinegar-based buffalo sauce are an optimal drinking accompaniment, as is a bowl of chashu ramen with milky pork bone broth, delicate noodles, pork belly, pickled ginger, sliced scallions, and a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds.",0,0
177,The Mermaid Inn,Seafood,2,"This laid-back and inviting seafood spot has been a neighborhood favorite for over a decade now, spawning locations in Greenwich Village and the Upper West Side. A steady stream of guests lines the bar early in the week for Monday's all night happy hour with freshly shucked oysters, snack-sized fish tacos, and other specially priced bites. For a hearty plate after your nosh, try blackened catfish dotted with crawfish butter alongside hushpuppies, or the lobster roll with Old Bay fries. On Sunday nights, look out for lobsterpalooza-a whole lobster accompanied by grilled corn on the cob and steamed potatoes. At the end of your meal there's no need to deliberate over dessert. A demitasse of perfect chocolate pudding is presented compliments of the house.",0,0
178,Panca,Peruvian,2,"First thing's first: go to the impressive wood bar lined with bottles of pisco and grab a handful of the wickedly good roasted Peruvian corn. Then settle into the rather lively and colorful dining room, or just ogle at the many cebiche options on the menu, another hallmark of the cuisine. If you choose to sit outside, be prepared to give up the interior's cantina-like vibe. Explore the tiradito (think of it like cebiche's cousin), which highlight sashimi-like cuts of seafood like fluke, shrimp, and octopus served on a duo of peppery aji amarillo or rocoto sauces. Panca gives equal honor to those other pillars of its national cuisine, serving a cilantro-stewed chicken with pitch-perfect garlic rice and potatoes topped with salsa criolla.",0,0
179,Via Carota,Italian,2,"An Italian eye for style and polished rusticity sit center stage at this sure-footed and fuss-free local favorite. From the warm dining room with whitewashed exposed brick walls and farmhouse tables to the marble bar, the artistic sensibility of Chefs/co-owners Rita Sodi and Jody Williams is evident before the meal even begins. Crostini are deceptively simple and flavorful, such as chicken livers folded with caramelized onions and sage generously spread over grilled sourdough bread. Fried green olives, pitted and stuffed with pork sausage arrive piping-hot and pleasing. Thick ribbons of pappardelle are a satisfying, chewy base for a hearty wild boar ragù. Bone-in fried rabbit is served with whole cloves of sweet and spreadable roasted garlic.",0,0
180,Babbo,Italian,4,"Is Mario Batali's beloved wild child of the fine dining scene mellowing a bit with age? Only in the best possible way. This warm, inviting mainstay still likes to keep its elegant good looks edgy with a little thumping music, but the general vibe inside seems to have settled into a sweeter, calmer version of its rambunctious youth. Nestled into quaint Waverly Place, Babbo's bi-level dining room fits right in: think shuttered windows and wrought-iron railings alongside thick wooden armchairs, white tablecloths, and the kind of dreamy low lighting made for late night rendezvous. The food itself is always artful and precise, and the menu more than delivers on its promise: creative, rustic Italian fare made with stellar skill and extraordinary ingredients. Mainstays like a delicate lamb's tongue vinaigrette arrives humming with tender beech mushrooms and topped with a 3-minute egg and mâche; while soft beef cheek ravioli bathed in a Castelmagno cheese- and black truffle-reduction is subtle but wow-inducing. Don't skip dessert: when this hot spot takes a swing on a classic semifreddo, drenching it in dark chocolate and a dusting of crushed pistachio, it hits it out of the park.",1,1
181,Mighty Quinn's,Barbecue,1,"From its humble beginnings as a Smorgasburg favorite, Mighty Quinn's continues to impress with its ""low and slow smoked barbecue."" And, boasting permanent outposts at the Hudson Eats FiDi food hall and West Village, this rustic and casual wood-lined space feels young and energetic with crowds of hungry diners lined up to the door. Cafeteria-like service features cleaver-wielding cooks proffering pulled pork, ribs, and more. Selections are sliced, weighed, and piled high before you even make it to the sides and vats of house pickles. Go for the baked beans, made with black-eyed peas and meaty burnt ends for plenty of umami. The best reason to come here may be the wonderfully wobbly-tender brisket, pink-tinged with smoke and thinly crusted in spice.",0,0
182,I Sodi,Italian,2,"Manhattan has classic Italian and new Italian, but not many thoughtful Italian restaurants. Tuscan native Rita Sodi is out to change that with this trattoria. She consciously selected every aspect of the design, from the heavy linen napkins to the thick, striated glass windows that hide the modern space from the marauding groups of young people on Bleecker. Inside this oasis, Negronis prep palates for al dente rigatoni and hearty, meat-focused dishes like the coniglio in porchetta. This exceptional rabbit preparation combines bacon-wrapped loin with a sweet wine- rosemary- and garlic-sauce. The herbal quality of such savoriness brings out the almost austere nature of the lean rabbit, showing how truly intuitive and innovative Italian cooking can be.",0,0
183,Hot Kitchen,Chinese,2,"True to its name, Hot Kitchen adds a dash of fiery Sichuan cooking to a neighborhood already rife with international delights. Whitewashed brick walls, chili-red beams, an orange accent wall, and ebony furnishings detail the tidy space. Steer clear of the Chinese-American portion of the menu; instead, partake in the memorable house specialties featuring dried chilies, Sichuan peppercorns, and pickled peppers that singe with abandon. However, a handful of straightforward items do bring relief from the spicy onslaught, as in minced pork with pickled cabbage in a light, sour broth; chunks of dark and salty-sweet braised beef and potatoes; and myriad hotpots (a recent menu addition). A second location can now be found in Midtown East on 53rd Street.",0,0
184,Malai Marke,Indian,2,"The name of this Curry Row resto translates to ""extra cream"" in Hindi tea stall slang, and rich and flavorful is indeed the order of the day. The clean, narrow space is bright and contemporary, with black tile walls and copper pots hanging from exposed brick. From the kitchen, tangra-style Calcutta-Chinese specialties are a new offering, however it is best to focus your attention on the preparations originating from the Southwest coast. Seafood and coconut factor heavily in Latta Shetty's shrimp ajadina, a dry-gravy stir-fry rich with red chillies and myriad spices. Chicken chutneywala is simmered in a bright yellow cream sauce seasoned with tart-sweet green mango chutney; and pumpkin sabji is another fantastic offering that also happens to be vegetarian. Win win!.",0,0
185,Sigiri,Sri Lankan,1,"Just off of Curry Row, Sigiri offers a sweetly spiced taste of Sri Lanka in an area known for its Indian dining. This second-floor room may be plain, but is very tidy with tables dressed in colorful linens that pop against the brownish walls. Stir-fried and slow-cooked specialties are sought after here, as in the black pork curry featuring an ink-dark sauce of roasted spices, chilies, black pepper, ginger, and cloves. The string hopper kotthu is deliciously traditional, served as a fluffy heap of rice noodles sautéed with bits of white meat chicken and an array of fresh vegetables with a small dish of vibrant coconut curry. Alcohol is not served, but a number of soft drinks are offered and guests are welcome to bring their own wine or beer.",0,0
186,Hakata Tonton,Japanese,2,"The food at this delicious West Village hot spot is specific to the Hakata region of Japan, an area that specializes in all kinds of pork parts like ears, feet, and tongue-and to secure a spot in the popular dining room, you should really call in a reservation or be prepared to wait. If the unusual menu and bland interior have you second-guessing yourself, have faith as the food will put those fears to rest soon enough. Kick things off with their spicy namesake hot pot, bubbling with plump ramen noodles, tender dumplings, bright vegetables, rich Berkshire pork belly and pigs feet. Then move on to mouthwatering grilled pig ears and foot served with thinly sliced scallions and ginger; or (for the bravest souls) their signature motsu (intestine) hot pot.",0,0
187,The Eddy,Contemporary,2,"If this innovative arrival is any indication, Curry Row could become the city's newest restaurant strip. Headlined by Chef Brendan McHale, formerly of Jack's Oyster Bar, the wee bistro is defined by a serious bar and well-managed dining area. The Eddy's menu defies easy categorization and offers cleverly constructed cooking. Fried beef tendons are a puffed and crunchy snack dabbed with charred onion cream and sweet trout roe. Delicate ricotta gnocchi with toasted hazelnuts showcases spring's sweet peas and pickled ramps, while golden spotted tile fish is seared and plated with squid ink Hollandaise, saffron broth, rice beans, and braised artichokes. Cardamom panna cotta with rhubarb granita and olive oil relays the menu's spirit to the finish line.",0,0
188,Root & Bone,American,2,"Down-home cooking, fried chicken, and a cocktail are just the thing at this cramped but cozy café. The packed room is difficult to take in during the dinner rush, but pretty touches include whitewashed brick walls, a pressed-tin ceiling, and glass-paned cabinets stocked with crockery. You might even adopt a drawl while reading through Root & Bone's pleasing menu. Grandma Daisy's warm angel biscuits are incredibly light and fluffy-especially alongside that salty-sweet, dark chicken-maple jus for dipping. The signature sweet tea-brined fried chicken is prepared in a designated corner of the room, filling the space with tempting aromas. Shrimp and grits with Virginia country ham has a Yankee touch thanks to the addition of Brooklyn lager to the sauce.",0,0
189,Porsena,Italian,2,"Sophisticates of all ages flock to this neighborhood favorite to be enveloped by a warm, welcoming, and upbeat vibe. Euro-chic Porsena also boasts adept servers who can be seen strutting about with appetizing platters of aromatic food. As always, Chef Sara Jenkins proves herself to be a talent and a pro through presentations that are unfussy yet remain uniquely flavorful and always special. The menu rotates with the seasons, but standbys cannot be missed, like wild escarole salad with crisp leaves wilting in hot anchovy dressing; or huge rounds of anelloni tossed with spicy lamb sausage, peppery mustard greens, and breadcrumbs. If offered, get the lasagna expertly layering pasta sheets with a creamy béchamel and hearty veal-prosciutto ragù.",0,0
190,Kiin Thai,Thai,2,"This sleek new Thai spot arrives on the heels of its popular sister restaurant, Somtum Der. Kiin Thai cuts an impressive figure design-wise, with its lofty ceilings, whitewashed walls and light-filled interior. Meanwhile, its equally impressive kitchen pushes out precise renditions of central and northern Thai dishes. Don't miss the khao soi, a gorgeous orange-hued curry featuring chewy noodles, tender braised chicken, hard-boiled egg, and the requisite condiments ready to amp the dish up to an incendiary level. Fish hor mok, a custardy curry tucked with striped sea bass, coconut milk, and duck eggs, topped with herbs and Kaffir lime is silky, while the excellent hor nueng gai with chicken, Thai eggplant, rice, and herbs is tenderly steamed in banana leaf.",0,0
191,L'Artusi,Italian,2,"This polished, airy West Village charmer is a magnet for beautiful people-or maybe it's just that everyone looks gorgeous in L'Artusi's romantically lit room, divvied up into three dining options and a quiet mezzanine, alongside its more traditional dining area. A semi-open kitchen, polished and gleaming with stainless steel, pushes out wickedly good Italian dishes like tender potato gnocchi in a rabbit cacciatore, laced with garlic, sweet tomato, rosemary and sage; or perfectly charred octopus paired with creamy potatoes spiked with chilies, olives and savory pancetta. Polish that off with a drink from their generous list of aperitivi or fantastic selection of wines by the glass, and you'll be feeling quite beautiful yourself by dinner's end.",0,0
192,Joseph Leonard,Contemporary,2,"No bigger than your average studio apartment, Joseph Leonard has a big personality and is insanely popular for good reason. From the antique mirrors to the nightly crowds, this contemporary American has nailed the heart and soul of Greenwich Village to become a regular spot for sipping well-sourced wines with friends and chomping down on wonderfully crisp rock shrimp fritters. The recognizable dishes are expertly prepared, fueled by top-notch ingredients and a kitchen that knows how to handle a pan-roasted chicken-arriving crisp-skinned and deliciously tender. Even humble Brussels sprouts get special treatment with a kick of sriracha. Finish it all off with monkey bread made with eggy-buttery brioche and a brilliantly subtle hint of maple.",0,0
193,Margaux,Mediterranean,2,"Calling all pretty young things: the fashionable Marlton Hotel is now home to one of the best bar-cum-restaurants around Washington Sq. Park. Walk through its posh lobby, past the sleek espresso station and massive wooden bar (complete with brass footrests-it's that kind of place), to enter Margaux, a 20th century-inspired Parisian bistro. The elegant, well-curated décor includes molded ceilings and floral tiles imported from Argentina, but you'll want to make a beeline for the dreamy, skylight-covered garden room. Settle in and order an innovative cocktail like the Artichoke Tea, a blend of Cynar, tea syrup, lemon, and cava, as well as a plate of juicy rotisserie chicken with smashed sweet potatoes, tangy urfa biber pepper, and powerful green harissa.",0,0
194,RedFarm,Asian,2,"The hot spot for upscale (and of the moment) Chinese food, RedFarm packs in the flavor, the noise, as well as the people. On any given night, the line will snake out the door, and a wait is inevitable to score a seat at their communal table in this industrial space. It's worth any hassle, though, when you sit down to experience the farm-to-table, Asian-fusion concept from big names in the business like Joe Ng & Ed Schoenfeld. The freewheeling kitchen relishes experimenting with local ingredients. Try the bright green pea-leaf and shrimp dumplings, which stand out beautifully in their near-translucent casing; or wok-fried Dungeness crab and crawfish in a thick and spicy basil-ginger sauce. For some Peking duck fun, head downstairs to Decoy.",0,0
195,Huertas,Spanish,3,"A festive spirit fronts this Basque country-inspired den, where pintxos are passed around in the bar. This is the kind of place that honors authentic sips like kalimotxo (red wine and cola), vermut (Catalan for vermouth), and sherry, so don't expect to see pitchers of sangria being bandied about. The proper dining room in the back is where the highly recommended tasting menu is served. This reasonably priced prix-fixe stimulates with small bites like sardine conserva served on buttered crostini with shaved radish; and may be followed by softly scrambled eggs drizzled with ruby shrimp jus, or seared lamb loin with greenmarket produce and crushed black olives. A chocolate custard topped with whipped cream and crushed Marcona almonds is heaven on a plate.",0,0
196,Somtum Der,Thai,2,"Based in Bangkok, this concrete jungle outpost is doing a terrific job of presenting Thai cuisine that perfectly reflects the modern spirit of the Northeast Isaan region. Upon entering Somtum Der, a cozy enclave stylishly accented with bright pops of red, diners are greeted by a glimpse of the kitchen and its somtum station. There, contents from the large glass jars of nuts, dried red chilies, and spices are ground in a mortar and pestle to produce its eponymous dish-also referred to as the city's best green papaya salad(s). Order big here, as the portions aren't massive and the food is plain terrific. The kitchen is happy to kick things up a notch spice-wise, so be aggressive and request the hotter end of the spectrum for greater authenticity. The service staff here is both friendly and hospitable, so heed their advice and include in every meal an addictive skewer of Der's-style grilled sticky rice to go along with the likes of lip-smacking larb tod. Other highlights have included succulent deep-fried chicken thighs sprinkled with toasted garlic chips and accompanied by a pungent citrus-and-spice dipping sauce. Smoky-sweet moo ping kati sod-marinated, grilled, and coconut-glazed pork set over cool rice vermicelli-is gloriously succulent and particularly addictive.",1,1
197,The Bao,Chinese,2,"Trade the hustle and bustle of Chinatown for the equally boisterous St. Marks Place as a destination for excellent soup dumplings. This being the East Village, the dining room is chic but low-key with a pale earthy color scheme framing a communal table and metal chairs. As for the menu, the restaurant's name says it all: the bao is absolute perfection. Presented in a bamboo steamer with soy and vinegar dipping sauce, each parcel is artfully dimpled, delightfully toothsome, and plumped with tasty broth and seasoned meat. Save room for sampling some of their other delicious specialties, including julienned celery stalks stir-fried with dried tofu; diced chives tossed with ground pork and fermented black beans; or XO sauce-fried rice.",0,0
198,Ramen Misoya,Japanese,1,"With 30 locations worldwide, Ramen Misoya brings its trademark ambrosial bowlfuls to New York City. The earthy dining area dons a bamboo-lined ceiling as well as a TV monitor that is internally looped to broadcast the kitchen's every move. The ramen offering here differentiates itself by centering on a trio of miso-enriched broths: shiro is a white miso fermented with rice koji (starter); kome-miso is richer tasting; and mame-miso is a strictly soybean product. The mouth-coating soup is delicious alchemy. Each slurp is a multifaceted distillation of pork and chicken bones with savory-salty-sweet notes, stocked with excellent noodles, vegetables, and the likes of panko-crusted shrimp tempura, fried ginger chicken, or slices of house-made cha-su.",0,0
199,Sushi Dojo,Japanese,2,"Chef David Bouhadana follows up his stint at Sushi Uo and some time in Japan to head up this winning sushi-ya. A 14-seat counter and handful of tables outfit this pleasant room, where the congenial chef sends forth an impressive array of morsels. The chef's choice menu is highly recommended and offers good value for the masterful skill and high quality of fish. This is immediately clear in the nigiri presentation that has included Tasmanian trout, cherry salmon from Japan, and a trio of maguro (lean, medium, and fatty). Beyond the sushi menu, sample dishes like house-made cold tofu served with yuzu salt; and kaki-age, a light and crisp tempura-fried combination of delicate mizuna, seaweed, squid, and shrimp with green-tea salt.",0,0
200,Empellón Taqueria,Mexican,2,"Owning a primo Village corner, Alex Stupak has turned this casual taqueria into a totally happening spot-on Saturdays, the small place bursts with night owls from all over the city. Along with upbeat tunes and ever-flowing Mezcal, this restaurant has as much spirit as it does spice. Of course, the flavor is abundant in dishes that can be terrifically delicious (if equally messy to eat). The sopes are a must, perhaps filled with enticingly salty and tasty refried black beans and a poached quail egg. Outrageously good queso melts Chihuahua cheese with any of the four toppings, especially the green chorizo, for pure gooey pleasure. Don't miss house salsas like smoked cashew or tomatillo-chipotle, even if it means paying extra as they're worth every penny!",0,0
201,Kyo Ya,Japanese,3,"In the basement level of a classic walk-up smack in the midst of a hip-artsy downtown neighborhood, Kyo Ya looks and feels like a secret hideaway cloaked in undulating wood and dark slate. The height of professionalism and hospitality, the staff is not merely attentive but appreciative of your presence at their table-or perhaps at one of the prized chef's counter stools for kaiseki dining, where mesmerizing craft is exhibited. This is a place where traditional cuisine is prepared with modern flair, and Japanese is the moneyed clientele's mother tongue. Refinement pervades every element of every dish, like the delicate, slightly tart pickled cabbage potage with chewy tri-colored taro root-potato dango and pale green strips of simmered vegetables finished with a dab of miso. The sashimi of the day may feature a fresh oyster with sautéed onion and yuzu kosho oroshi swimming in ponzu; simmered firefly squid and celery topped with salty karashi-miso and pickled plum; or tender raw octopus. Clay pots reveal fragrant dashi cooked with woodear mushooms, carrots, turnips, and bobbing with a tiny melting ball of excellent mozzarella as well as the quenelle-like shrimp dumpling, ebishinjo.",1,1
202,Perry Street,Contemporary,2,"All New York gastronauts will be familiar with the Vongerichten name but it's actually Jean-Georges' son Cédric who heads up the kitchen here. The restaurant is on the first floor of the Richard Meier Towers and, if you stretch, you can just about see the Hudson outside. The room is bright, open, and contemporary although the anodyne muzak suggests a lack of faith in their customers' ability to create their own atmosphere or an acknowledgment of the room's lack of warmth. The influences on the food are largely French and American with the occasional Asian note. The combinations on the plate are nothing too challenging; dishes are colourful; and the flavors pronounced. The great value lunch menu should make it far busier during the day than it is.",0,0
203,Tuome,Fusion,2,"Chef Thomas Chen's intimate venue flaunts petite East Village bones, a warm glow cast over the hip crowd, and a too-loud playlist that may cause indigestion for anyone older than a Millenial. Asian accents filtered through the mind of this chef (who spent time behind the line at Eleven Madison Park) reveal a playful lineup. Treviso spears are brushed with creamy Caesar dressing and plated with warm, buttery croutons, clementine segments, and toasted sunflower seeds. Black bass is expertly seared and sauced with New England-style clam chowder pocked with Chinese sausage and perfectly complemented by a side of banana leaf-wrapped sticky rice enriched with duck fat. If you still have room for dessert, order the hot, crisp, and mildly sweet Chinese beignets.",0,0
204,Hasaki,Japanese,2,"Since the mid-eighties, this local darling has been going strong thanks to its high quality ingredients, skilled kitchen, and excellent value. For under $20, the soba lunch set will warm the heart of any frugal fan of Japanese cuisine. This generous feast features a bowl of green tea noodles in hot, crystal-clear dashi stocked with wilted water spinach and fish cake, accompanied by lean tuna chirashi, yellowtail, and kanpyo. The ten-don, a jumbo shrimp tempura served over rice, is just as enticing. The à la carte offerings draw crowds seeking delish sushi as well as a host of tasty cooked preparations; a Twilight menu is nice for early birds. The dining room has a clean and spare look, with seating available at a number of wood tables or sizable counter.",0,0
205,Fedora,Contemporary,2,"An ode to the New York old guard, Fedora still attracts the creative, the moneyed and the young. It's a sort of dreamlike supper club where well-crafted cocktails flow into endless conversations, the words absorbed into the crevices of the original carved wooden bar as they have for generations. No longer a renowned literati haunt, Fedora remains an attractive homage to the Village of yore. Tuck your bag and coat into the cubby above the banquette and set off on an adventure in contemporary cuisine, one that mixes barbecue cream with smoked salmon and highlights the distinctive wines of Jura. This builds to the excellent and gargantuan crispy duck with perfectly lacquered skin accented by a date-barbecue sauce that's pure hedonistic inspiration.",0,0
206,Oiji,Korean,2,"Headed by a duo of young Korean-born chefs who met at the Culinary Institute of America and put their education to work in the stellar kitchens of Bouley and Gramercy Tavern, Oiji dishes out an updated take on Korean flavors. The intimate dining room is small and moodily lit, with an open kitchen that allows diners to see and hear the action as it takes place. Polished and refined yet familiar, the concise menu of small plates offers an appealing approach. Decadently rich and creamy, the wild sesame soup-a dairy-free sensation-is poured over wild mushrooms, chewy rice cake, and black truffle. Pine smoke-infused mackerel is served with a wedge of lemon and yuzu-soy sauce to brighten the fragrant and oily-rich fish. Of course, the kimchi is not to be missed.",0,0
207,Mary's Fish Camp,Seafood,2,"This West Village seafood shack is much more than just a destination for lobster rolls. Located on an irresistibly cute corner with large windows, Mary's Fish Camp tempts with creative daily specials scrawled on a chalkboard, sweet and briny raw offerings, and nostalgic desserts like hot fudge sundaes. Crowds pack into the curving stainless steel counter while white, lazy fans spin overhead. The summery space offers lots of choice, but the lobster roll should not be overlooked. A toasted bun is overflowing with hunks of tender, sweet meat dressed in the perfect proportion of mayonnaise and lemon juice, with a mountain of shoestring fries on the side. Begin the meal with spicy Key West conch chowder and then end with a slice of Americana-banana cream pie.",0,0
208,Pylos,Greek,2,"Restaurateur Christos Valtzoglou has found the winning formula with this longstanding hideaway. Although his Heartbreak and Boukies may be faded memories, Pylos continues to sparkle as brightly as the Aegean Sea on a summer day. Taking its name from the Greek translation of ""made from clay,"" this contemporary taverna features a ceiling canopy of suspended terra-cotta pots dressing up a room with whitewashed walls and lapis-blue insets. Pale-green stemware and stark white crockery are used to serve Greek wines and a menu of rustic home-style cooking. Gigantes are baked in honey-scented tomato-dill sauce; grilled marinated octopus is drizzled with balsamic reduction; and anginares moussaka is a creamy vegetarian take on the classic made with artichokes.",0,0
209,Lavagna,Italian,2,"The little menu at this neighborhood fixture proves that quality trumps size. Lavagna's kitchen is snug but still manages to make ample use of a wood-burning oven to bake everything from delicate pizette to whole roasted fish. Pastas are always a treat, while other tasty options can include pan-fried smoked scamorza paired with a roasted red pepper crostini, juicy rack of lamb, or a slice of spot-on crostata filled with seasonal fruit and dressed with caramel sauce. Framed mirrors, a pressed-tin ceiling, and candlelight produce a mood that is almost as warm as the genuinely gracious service, which ensures that regulars receive the royal treatment. That said, everyone who steps through these doors feels welcome and well taken care of.",0,0
210,Oda House,Eastern European,2,"For a taste of something different, this inviting café serves intriguing specialties from Georgia. That country's proximity to Russia, Turkey, and Armenia results in a vibrant and enticingly diverse cuisine that Oda House does proud. A liberal use of fragrant spices, cheese-filled breads, kebabs, and slow-cooked meats typify the kitchen's preparations. Classic dishes include satsivi, boiled chicken served cool in a creamy walnut sauce seasoned with warm spices, accompanied by gomi, hominy grits in a mini cauldron studded with morsels of rich, stretchy sulgani cheese. Balance out the hearty fare with a fresh, perfectly dressed garden salad. The vibe is simple and rustic with pumpkin-stained stucco walls, exposed brick, and wood furnishings.",0,0
211,Noreetuh,Fusion,2,"For a taste of something different, make a beeline to this worthwhile Hawaiian-flavored newcomer. Headed by a trio of Per Se veterans, Noreetuh features an intimate setting of two slender dining rooms adorned with hexagonal mirrors and shelving units used to store bottles from the impressive wine list. Bigeye tuna poke strewn with seaweed, diced macadamia nuts, and pickled jalapeños is just one of the delicious highlights on offer, while plump shrimp seasoned with crushed garlic and arranged over a bed of sticky rice and baby romaine is another fine choice. For dessert, the signature take on bread pudding boasts caramelized slices of custard-soaked King's Hawaiian bread with rum raisins and a knockout scoop of pineapple ice cream.",0,0
212,Left Bank,Contemporary,2,"Left Bank may have plenty of local competition, but few have the attentive and considerate service combined with such a lively bar scene. With its faux-farmhouse décor and rather bucolic corner location, it is a go-to neighborhood haunt. Happy hour specials bring them in, but the bar bites make them stay. Every dish on the menu is pleasing, from the buttery lobster puffs perched on champagne cream to the perfectly crafted Mongolian dumplings, full of spicy lamb, cabbage, and onion with a cool soy-lime dipping sauce. The lovely farfalle with fresh favas, sunchoke, spring onion, and chili is bound by a sprinkling of nutty Parmigiano. Top it off with deliciously simple desserts, like a wedge of ricotta cheesecake and a properly poached Bosc pear.",0,0
213,Sevilla,Spanish,2,"Yellowed menus that haven't changed in decades make this old-school Spanish stalwart seem like a relic. Still, no one comes here to be surprised. Rather, they are plowing through their favorite renditions of paella, ranging from vegetable to seafood with chicken and chorizo. The paella Valenciana also adds clams, mussels, and lobster claws. Prices are low, portions are large, and lively crowds are always happy. Dishes are made to order, so if that arroz con pollo takes 30 minutes to get to your table, know that it will be worthy of the wait. It arrives as a massive amount of saffron-tinged rice and tender bone-in chicken dotted with green onions, pepper strips, lots of garlic, chorizo, and peas. Come dessert, you cannot go wrong with the flan.",0,0
214,Vinegar Hill House,American,2,"Find this carriage house just steps from the historic Commandant's House and Navy Yard, in a neighborhood that is quickly becoming a beacon for artisans. After its full recovery from Superstorm Sandy, this one-time butcher shop and ever-popular haunt is again as distinguished and delicious as ever. Packed to the rafters with locals, this ""house"" boasts quality, sustainable products prepared in a wood-burning oven. A wonderfully broiled grapefruit topped with puffed rice mixed with shrimp paste, or liver pâté topped with pistachios display an inventive mix of global ingredients. Favorites like pappardelle with shad roe and lemon zest, or caramelized pork chops with creamy grits are flooded with flavor; while most everything that comes from that prominent oven is a big hit.",0,0
215,Spasso,Italian,2,"The quaint far West Village has no dearth of Italian restaurants, and Spasso distinguishes itself not only with its ornate, white wood-framed windows, but an inviting ambience and stellar service. It's the friendly corner spot with a marble bar where you can sip a glass of Nebbiolo and chat with the chefs, or simply dine solo on bowls of fresh pasta. The bells and whistles are here with squid ink spaghettini with mosciame or air-dried tuna (a specialty of Sardinia); and tripe ragù over tagliatelle. But creative dishes, like giardiniera-laced beef tartare also star, as a tangy twist on the traditional. Speaking of twists, affogato offers quite the kick with ice cream that is ""choked"" with sherry, amaro, or rye whiskey and then drizzled with a shot of espresso.",0,0
216,Soba-Ya,Japanese,1,"In a neighborhood replete with tempting Japanese dining options, Soba-Ya has been sating noodle cravings with awesome buckwheat soba and hearty udon-all homemade daily-for more than a decade. Enterprising co-owner Bon Yagi, also of Curry-Ya, favors authenticity over flash in his establishments, and this popular spot fashioning a traditional aesthetic is no exception. Sit among the largely Japanese lunchtime clientele to savor and slurp cold, refreshing soba attractively served in a red-black bento box. Find it neatly stocked with the likes of dashi-poached vegetables, fresh and deliciously glazed salmon, or crisp shrimp tempura. Complete this meal with a pot of hot broth added to your remaining soy-based dipping sauce for a warming finish.",0,0
217,Robataya,Japanese,2,"Irasshaimase! This is the kind of intensely authentic place where welcomes are shouted to guests upon entering. At peak times, wait among Japanese expats and young couples lining the sidewalk. Aim straight for the counter to appreciate the theatrics of it all, where orders are acknowledged with more shouts flying from Japanese servers to chefs. The energy is high, but so are the standards for their expertly grilled meats and vegetables. Kneeling cooks use long wooden paddles to deliver dishes hot off the robata, like gyu tataki, seared beef filet topped with tobiko and scallions on a bed of red onions with ponzu. Technical mastery is clear in a salt-packed sea bream's subtle smoky flavors emphasizing the delicacy of such white, flaky fish.",0,0
218,Prime & Beyond New York,Steakhouse,3,"This location of the Fort Lee, NJ original brings great steak to the East Village. Appropriate for this locale, the setting eschews the standard men's club swagger of most steakhouses for a look that's spare and cool. Despite the chillax vibe, expect to see suits; the meat is that good. In fact, it's procured from the same purveyor that supplies Peter Luger and Keens. Aged in-house for six weeks, the USDA Prime Porterhouse is presented hot off the grill but well rested, richly flavored, tender, and juicy. Myriad cuts satisfy all preferences, while sides like kimchi, spicy scallion salad, and fermented cabbage stew are especially appealing and honor the owners' heritage. Heartwarming Korean-style soups and stews are wonderful wintertime favorites.",0,0
219,Wallsé,Austrian,3,"There are some foods that just feel right at certain times of the year. When the nights draw in and there's a little chill in the air, there are certain words whose very presence on a menu summon feelings of comfort and warmth-and those words surely include spaetzle, schnitzel, and strudel. Austrian cuisine is known for being hearty and immeasurably satisfying, but the great strength of Wallsé is that you don't have to have spent the day skiing in Innsbruck to appreciate its cuisine because the adept kitchen has a lightness of touch and is not rigidly tied to tradition. Whether you've chosen the loin of venison with bone marrow or have gone for the tafelspitz, you'll find the dishes are nicely balanced and effortlessly easy to eat. The restaurant is divided into two rooms, both dominated by striking paintings, some of which are of the chef himself. The clientele is a largely sophisticated bunch with an inherent understanding of how restaurants work which, in turn, creates an easy, relaxing atmosphere. The wine list also merits examination, if only to discover there's more to Austrian wine than Grüner Veltliner.",1,1
220,Café Mogador,Moroccan,1,"The key to this beloved café's long-term success is its popular array of tasty, crowd-pleasing Moroccan favorites. A veritable landmark in the East Village, the decades-old hangout is as inviting as ever-and despite the constant crush of its brainy-hip set, it remains inexplicably fresh-faced. Open from morning to night, breakfast offers the likes of eggs any style sided by hummus and tabouli, whereas afternoon fare may include tasty specials like bastilla or harira-the hearty and fragrant soup. Chicken tagine is excellent: try it with fluffy couscous and charmoula, a spicy green herb sauce, or order it Casablanca-style with chickpeas, raisins, and onions. For a taste of Morocco across the East River, visit Mogador's flourishing Williamsburg outpost.",0,0
221,Alta,Contemporary,2,"From an ivy-cloaked façade to the complex menu items, Alta seems to imply mystery. Inside its brick townhouse, this attractive and comforting scene mixes antique Moorish floors, splashes of yellow, and a cozy wood-burning fireplace. The second level looks like a balcony but is just as packed thanks to the kitchen's excellent menu selection. These small plates have featured pillowy lamb meatballs in a pool of charred red-pepper sauce, or uni draped over crostini covered with a shimmering sheet of Ibèrico bacon. Wok-seared taglierini reveals cuttlefish slivers sautéed with crispy garlic chips. First-rate ingredients are surpassed only by thoughtful combinations in desserts like silky pot de crème capped in pistachio powder-a midsummer night's dream.",0,0
222,Spotted Pig,Gastropub,3,"It's impossible to tell if the famously talented April Bloomfield ever imagined the celebrity draw her restaurant would have over the likes of, say, Kanye West (who reputedly tweeted a drinks invite here to his followers). But many years ago, when Spotted Pig sashayed its way onto an adorable corner of the West Village, New York City was more than ready to meet-and fall completely in love with-the gastropub. But as popular as the restaurant (and now the gastropub trend itself) has grown, Bloomfield's cooking has always been the real draw. And, it doesn't matter if you are teetering on a wooden stool, knocking elbows with pencil-thin hipsters all night in this cozy, bi-level space. With food like this, you might as well be on the moon. Bloomfield has made her name on those outstanding burgers, pan-seared mackerel, and legendary gnudi (feather-light orbs of ricotta ""gnocchi"" laced with brown butter, crispy sage, and nutty parmesan) but you really can't miss on this menu. Kick things off with a small plate of fresh, creamy burrata and grilled sourdough, spread with fava, mint, and a few chili flakes; and then move on to a perfectly roasted poussin, served with Sherry vinegar, grilled ramps, and delicate spring onions.",1,1
223,Extra Virgin,Mediterranean,2,"Consistently good with an easygoing attitude, this longstanding neighborhood gem is a hit with everyone from young families and ladies-who-brunch, to dog-owners enjoying sidewalk seating. Fresh flowers, blue-velvet barstools, and canvas paintings make it the perfect fusion of casual and classy; rock music lightens the mood. Pristine olive oils march from the kitchen as if to whet the appetite for a parade of Mediterranean classics to pair with food-friendly Italian wines. Start with butternut squash ravioli bathed in brown butter-mascarpone sauce, or the beautifully textured halibut on herbed tomato carpaccio for an instant return to summer. Roasted Brussels sprouts combine with caramelized apples to cut the enticing richness of fatty pancetta.",0,0
224,Kura,Japanese,4,"Set among a stretch of storefronts is this plain white façade that is so discreet, it actually stands out and grabs your attention. Hidden within is a hangout favored by a predominantly Japanese clientele crowded at the counter. Chef Norihiro Ishizuka runs the show, jovially engaging with his guests while slicing, forming, torching, and rolling. The only option here is omakase and diners choose their preference from three price points. Begin a meal here with sushi, which at times might be loosely formed, but the fish is of irreproachable quality and the experience absolutely special. Recent delights have included torched mackerel hako nigiri, a live prawn followed by its crispy deep-fried head, a heap of tiny raw sakura ebi, and a tuna hand roll to finish.",0,0
225,Morandi,Italian,3,"From first sight, this prominent West Village location does much to resemble a farmhouse or cantina. Wood panels, antique tiles, tin ceilings, and shelves displaying straw-covered bottles of Chianti conjure an American's idyllic dream of Italy. The food is a more genuine reflection. Decadent beginnings might include tart and very crisp fried olives stuffed with meat. Plates of fried artichokes brightened with preserved lemon are unmissable, especially when paired with a choice of hand-stretched focaccia. Long twists of busiate al ragù di pesce spada are tossed with swordfish and excellent spicy almond pesto. Nightly specials showcase the likes of vitello alla Milanese with a crust so perfect and piping-hot, that it threatens to shatter with a fork.",0,0
226,Kajitsu,Japanese,3,"It's the way of the modern world that we think of the changing of the seasons more in terms of our wardrobe rather than our food-but a meal at Kajitsu could change that. This Japanese vegan restaurant serves shojin cuisine based on the precepts of Buddhism-if you're in search of an antidote to the plethora of steakhouses in the city, this is it. The second floor, traditionally decorated space is a sanctuary of peace and tranquility and offers table or counter seating and service that is as charming as it is earnest. Such is the skill of the kitchen you'll forget in no time about the absence of fish or meat. It's all about balance, harmony and simplicity-and allowing the ingredients' natural flavors to shine, whether it's the delicate onion soup with mizuna and potato, or the visually arresting hassun which could include everything from mountain yam to burdock root. Your period of contemplation and newfound respect for your fellow man may come to a juddering halt when you find yourself back on Lexington but, for a few moments at least, you'll feel you connected with nature.",1,1
227,Rai Rai Ken,Japanese,1,"Rai Rai Ken isn't quite what it used to be-it's bigger and much more comfortable. Just a few doors east of its former location, this room boasts a fresh and tidy look with blonde wood seating plus signature red vinyl stools. An array of pots remain bubbling and steaming behind the counter. Rest assured the menu's star attraction-those thin and toothsome ramen noodles-are just as delicious, served with four near-addictive, fantastically complex broth variations: shio, shoyu, miso, and curry. Each bowlful is chock-full of garnishes, like slices of roasted pork, boiled egg, nori, fishcake, and a nest of springy noodles. Grab a business card before leaving as loyal diners are rewarded with a complimentary bowl after ten visits.",0,0
228,Curry-Ya,Japanese,1,"Complex, warming, and perfumed with fruity sweetness, slow-cooked wafuu (or Japanese-style) curry is a highly popular national treat. Tantalizingly draped over a mound of steamed short grain rice, each bowl calls for one of the kitchen's tasty embellishments such as panko-crusted fried shrimp, pan-fried hamburger steak, Berkshire pork, or chicken katsu. The brief menu also offers inspiring starters like flavor-packed tofu skin and green bean salad tossed with parmesan and a crushed-olive dressing. Brought to you by Bon Yagi (also of Rai Rai Ken, a few doors away), this local jewel has 14-seats along a white marble counter lined with bowls of pickles and dried onion flakes. The space may seem simple but it's a spectacular destination to dig in and enjoy.",0,0
229,Cagen,Japanese,4,"Boasting soothing textured walls the color of sand, sturdy but comfortable furnishings, and cool slate flooring, thisserene and serious space is just what one would expect of a high-end Japanese dining room. But, beyond this quotidian look is a kitchen that turns out very exciting-and quite unexpected-food. Tables are an available option, but a seat facing Chef Toshio Tomita at the pristine elm counteris the place to be. While the menu offers both à la carte dining and a sushionly omakase, the Chef's Counter omakase is by far the best experience to be had here. This meal begins with a playful platter of bites (envision smoked ham katsu) to break the ice and stimulate the palate for the kitchen's sparkling sashimi. Slices of Hokkaido octopus, marinated bonito, and snapper are a treat, dressed not only with freshly ground wasabi root and top-notch soy sauce, but also the chef's signature chimichurri-a touch of fusion that signals his decade-plus years of working at Nobu. Another highlight is the chilled handmade soba served with spicy buckwheat sprouts and a divine dipping sauce. Cooked dishes, like fried soft-shell crab with watermelon salad, and impressive nigiri round out Cagen's kappo-style meal.",1,1
230,Graffiti,Contemporary,2,"Credibly doted on since it's inception in 2007, this cub of Chef/owner Jehangir Mehta is still going strong and baby boy is quite the dreamboat. Dressed with tightly-packed square communal tables and beaded ceiling lights, petite Graffiti may be dimly lit, but an exposed brick wall glossed with a metallic finish and hugging framed mirrors is all brightness. Feeding a pack of 20 on newspaper-wrapped tables are Indian-inspired sweet and savory small plates of watermelon and feta salad cooled by a vibrant mint sorbet; eggplant buns spiked with toasty cumin; green mango paneer; and a zucchini-hummus pizza. If you forget to order the addictive green chili shrimp, you can hit Mehtaphor in the Duane Street Hotel for a taste of this spicy delight.",0,0
231,Dieci,Fusion,2,"Dieci fuses Italian and Japanese cuisines for a successful marriage of taste and creativity. Springy ramen clutching spicy lamb Bolognese is a perfect example of this flavorful union. The tiny step-down setting is easy to miss but conquers its spatial challenge with comfortable seats. Find foodies centered around a dining counter that juts out from the kitchen-a handful of small tables also bolster the accommodations. A unique array of small plates includes buffalo mozzarella with uni and yuzu foam, and steamed buns filled with Berkshire pork belly. Meanwhile, entrées go on to include miso-glazed cod set atop an appealing wild mushroom risotto fortified by a poached egg. Desserts are equally impressive, as in a silky Earl Grey crème brûlée.",0,0
232,ChikaLicious,Contemporary,1,"Named for Pastry Chef/owner Chika Tillman, this sweet spot presents an all-encompassing dessert experience that somehow manages to impress without overkill. The chic white space offers counter seating overlooking a lab-clean kitchen, where the team prepares elegant jewels that start as butter, sugar, and chocolate. À la carte is offered, but the best way to appreciate this dessert bar is to select the prix-fixe. Feasts here may begin with an amuse-bouche of Darjeeling tea gelée with milk sorbet; followed by a mascarpone semifreddo topped with espresso granita. Then finish with pillowy cubes of coconut-marshmallow petits fours. Dessert Club across the street tempts with delish cookies, cupcakes, and shaved ice for a grab-and-go fix.",0,0
233,Gotham Bar and Grill,American,3,"Warm, personable, and genuine, Gotham Bar and Grill has everything a New York restaurant needs to stand the test of time. Inside, find towering floral arrangements and lofty ceilings hung with massive fabric-draped fixtures, which soften the room's appearance. The interior is vast, but the sunken dining area, elevated bar, and smartly divided room feel more classic than overdone. The service team exemplifies on-the-ball excellence. This kitchen's distinctive American seasonal cooking is in clear balance from start to finish. Begin with the simple-sounding tuna tartare combining chopped yellowfin and shiso surrounded by Japanese cucumber, enlivened with miso-ginger vinaigrette. Move on to explore seasonal risotto, showcasing wintery mushrooms or perhaps a summery feast of sweet shrimp, chives, and touch of tomato. Batter-fried soft-shell crabs are a feat of technical perfection, with body and crisped legs set over sautéed vegetables and a light citrus-soy reduction. Desserts alone are worth a visit, especially to indulge in the famously dense chocolate cake, served warm with a scoop of luscious salted-almond ice cream and cracked cocoa nibs. The ""greenmarket"" prix-fixe lunch offers great value and quality.",1,1
234,Yerba Buena Perry,Latin American,2,"As vivacious as a samba, Yerba Buena Perry transports you to a South American paradise, where Latin-inspired dishes cover each table, the bartender never stops shaking celebrated drinks, and loud laughter and music fill the tight space. A longtime favorite, this staff and the kitchen have their choreography down. Of course the smoky chipotle-laced guacamole is a necessary way to start the meal. Some dishes show Peruvian twists, like jalapeño-soy dressed tuna ceviche with pickled watermelon; as well as Thai basil-jalapeño ocopa sauce, a Peruvian tradition, to accompany those thin and crisp butternut squash-and-Manchego empanadas. Don't leave without trying the wow-inducing panko-coated watermelon fries and poblano-infused tomato ketchup.",0,0
235,Shuko,Japanese,4,"Chefs Nick Kim and Jimmy Lau, the dynamic duo of the city's sushi scene, have reemerged to take residency behind this U-shaped ash counter. Every seat is filled nightly, surrounding the large team at work. Soft lighting highlights the texture of exposed brick walls to moody effect, and a thumping playlist says downtown-albeit too loudly. A sushi tasting and sushi kaiseki are the only options offered yet diners will not be left wanting. While the latter is a fuller experience working in an abundance of flavors like pan-seared squab breast, the tasting is a slightly streamlined and more rewarding choice. Regardless of your decision, a morsel of toothsome house-made mochi, dabbed with toasty pistachio miso, is a delightfully enticing opener.",0,0
236,Momofuku Ko,Contemporary,4,"David Chang's beloved Ko has packed up its 600-square-foot tasting course concept and moved a few blocks south. Down a quiet alley and behind a door sporting his proverbial peach, you'll find the handsome new digs: a street-hip space sporting 40 seats, 22 of them surrounding the open kitchen via a U-shaped counter made of smooth black walnut. Much else remains the same. Per the old rules, there is no à la carte-only the multicourse menu for the evening (which you're given in print before you go). Then, dishes are delivered by the chefs themselves, who briefly describe each ingredient; while servers slip seamlessly between guests, changing silver and filling drinks. Chang is a veritable rock star chef by any standard (and his longtime lieutenant Sean Gray is the chef's equivalent of Keith Richards), so you're in expert hands from the start. Fresh, sweet sea bream is bound by translucent grated yam with fragrant shiso and pops of finger lime; and tender beef tartare is paired with cream of oyster as well as crushed popcorn. Delicate kabocha squash tortellini arrives with shaved parmesan and agrodolce; and a perfectly seared slice of venison is paired with silky potatoes and earthy Époisses.",2,1
237,Kanoyama,Japanese,2,"Offering an impressive lineup of excellent quality and deftly prepared fish, this popular and permanently packed sushi den is housed in a space that may be simply decorated but is spotless and well-maintained. The kitchen's focus here is on a parade of pristine cuts that are bolstered by a passage of daily items such as rich baby shad from Japan and tender, mild American white bonito. Also find a generous listing of plump, briny oysters; starters such as wakasagi tempura (fried baby smelts) sprinkled with green tea-salt; and a handful of cooked entrées. The value-conscious omakase is highly recommended. Besides being tempting, the website is very informative: it presents diverse fish facts, photos, and recommendations for seasonality and preparation.",0,0
238,Momofuku Noodle Bar,Asian,2,"This elder member of David Chang's culinary empire is hipper and hotter than ever. A honey-toned temple of updated comfort food, decked with blonde wood counters and a sparkling open kitchen, the service here may be brisk. But rest assured, as the menu is gutsy and molded with Asian street food in mind. Those steamed buns have amassed a gargantuan following thanks to decadent fillings like moist pork loin kissed with Hollandaise and chives. Additionally, that bowl of springy noodles doused in a spicy ginger-scallion sauce is just one instance of the crew's signature work. Korean fried chicken with seasonal greens is fit for a king; while more modest items, including desserts like candy apple truffle, are beautifully crafted and rightfully elevated to global fame.",0,0
239,Malaparte,Italian,2,"Tucked into one of those idyllic, tree-lined West Village corners that looks straight off a movie set, Malaparte is the kind of cozy, romantic spot you need in your date night rolodex. Bare wood tables; large, framed windows for people-watching; low lighting; and exposed brick walls all lend a hand in creating that perfect osteria vibe. As if that weren't enough to sustain a loyal following, Malaparte takes its home-style Italian cooking to the next level. Try one of the excellent pizza specials; the dadi di tonno scottato, a dish of wildly fresh seared tuna tossed in avocado-sesame dressing; the bang-on lasagna Bolognese, a silky version of this classic dish boasting an exquisitely good veal and pork ragù; or the melt-in-your-mouth chocolate mousse.",0,0
240,Colonie,Contemporary,2,"Hip and lively (both the crowd and the green wall of lush plants that is), this is a buzzing retreat for taking in all that makes Brooklyn so enticing. There is the exposed brick dining room and the ceilings of distressed wood, of course, along with the requisite long bar and perhaps most important, a sharp crowd who give Colonie its measured dose of cool. Start with crostini, perhaps laden with egg salad, a ribbon of lardo and drizzle of veal jus. A deeply nutty rye berry ragout brings together crispy mushrooms, cabbage, and a perfectly fried duck egg. Opt for the whole market fish, served deboned with tart and herbaceous salsa verde, crisp garlic, and roasted lemon. Be sure to save room for warm, yeasty sugar donuts stuffed with Chantilly cream.",0,0
241,Cacio e Pepe,Italian,2,"This charming Italian gioia has welcomed diners for more than a decade now. But in relaying its pleasures, one must begin with the eponymous house specialty. This fresh tonnarelli tossed with pasta water, olive oil, cracked black pepper, and a showering of pecorino is pure delight. Those willing to branch out will find other pasta dishes here as equally pleasing, like the maltagliati dressed with a savory monkfish ragù revved up with olives, capers, and an unexpected hit of ginger. Mussels in black pepper ""soup"" is a savory bowl of mollusks and broth with garlicky croutons for soaking up the enticingly salty liquid. Exposed brick and wood furnishings complement the zucca-orange walls lined with wine bottles offered on the all-Italian list.",0,0
242,Edi & The Wolf,Austrian,2,"Chefs Eduard Frauneder and Wolfgang Ban are the dynamic duo behind this downtown facsimile of a heuriger- basically a casual neighborhood wine tavern popular throughout Austria. The dark and earthy den is chock-full of reclaimed materials including a 40-foot rope salvaged from a church, now coiled above the tiny bar. The crux of the offerings is comprised of small and shared plates such as cured and dried landjäger sausage, accompanied by house-made mustard and pickles. Entrées fall under the heading of ""schnitzel & co."" and offer a highly recommended wiener schnitzel, which starts with a pounded filet of heritage pork encased in an incredibly delicate and crunchy coating, finished with an Austrian-style potato salad and lingonberry jam.",0,0
243,All'onda,Italian,3,"All'onda cuts a dramatic impression from the outset, especially come nightfall, when its narrow, all-glass façade lights up like a dream. Inside, you'll find a décor swept in whitewashed brick, rich walnut paneling, honeycomb tiles and lovely, whimsical flower arrangements. Also the co-founder of Uma Temakeria, Chef Chris Jaeckle pulls influence from all sorts of lands far and near, surprising customers with every new visit.Dinner might kick off with creamy hamachi crudo, sporting curls of crispy carrot and a fresh kick of peperoncino oil; and then move on to a nest of al dente bucatini twirled with uni, spicy breadcrumbs, and tarragon. Curly ramen-yes ramen-bobbing in parmesan broth with a soft egg, pork belly, and Brussels sprouts is a welcome surprise.",0,0
244,Hibino,Japanese,1,"The team at this demure retreat isn't constrained by a menu. Instead, diners are greeted by servers bearing blackboards that list the day's offerings. The list of obanzai (Kyoto-style tapas) are enticing and include marinated, fried chicken thigh with tartar sauce, grilled pork sausage, or roasted oysters with spicy gazpacho. The kitchen's regional dedication is also evident in its offering of Osaka's traditional hako sushi. This box-pressed preparation might be served as a layering of quality rice, shiso, kanpyo (preserved gourd), and salmon. Meanwhile, lunch is a concise affair that reveals either a bento box or platter of nigiri accompanied by a neatly stuffed futomaki. Of course, if lunch seems limited, come back for dinner when the kitchen truly shines.",0,0
245,The Place,American,2,"Set deep within the West Village, The Place is the kind of cozy, grotto-style den that makes you feel all grown-up. Rendezvous-like, guests climb below street level to find a bar aglow with flickering votive candles. Wander back a bit, and you'll find rustic beams and white tablecloth seating; two outdoor terraces beckon when the sun shines. The guileless name of this ""place"" and timeless look of its century-old setting is nicely juxtaposed by a wholly American menu that roams from east to west: duck confit-filled parcels with grain mustard and braised red cabbage is a lovely autumnal treat, while entrées please year-round with dishes like a cheddar-capped Shepherd's pie; Long Island duck breast with tamarind sauce; and Cuban-style pork chops.",0,0
246,Recette,Contemporary,3,"A consummate pleaser, this corner restaurant mimics the character of the neighborhood-intimate, quaint, and sophisticated. Inside and out, a buzzy vibe seems to extend from the semi-open kitchen to the small bar. Service is genuine and warm; decorative mirrors make the most of the diminutive space, accented with tall wood-framed windows. Dishes are inventive, often deliciously riffing on the familiar. For a fun twist on wings, try the crispy, soft-centered ""Buffalo"" sweetbreads with a blue di bufala dip and pickled celery. Raw snapper is topped with grated bottarga and pickled onion, served alongside crispy oyster fritters. Heartier dishes include fresh-cut spaghetti with sweet shrimp, tomato, chili, and sea urchin or venison loin-stuffed cabbage.",0,0
247,Feast,Contemporary,2,"This recent arrival with the straightforward but promising moniker is a rustic, textbook amalgam of wood, brick, and tiles. The kitchen is confidently led by an alum of Veritas who has devised several prix-fixe menus, served family-style. These might be based on the farmer's market or even a nose-to-tail meal of lamb, including merguez stew; and a lasagna layering shank, broccoli rabe, and goat cheese. If you're not up for a whole feast, dine à la carte on meaty, ocean-fresh oysters capped by cocktail sauce aspic; or a nouveau take on incredibly tender chicken and ""dumplings"" of liver-stuffed pan-fried gnocchi and wisps of crisped skin. End with the awesome Valrhona chocolate pudding-leaving a single dark chocolate cookie crumb behind is impossible.",0,0
248,Flinders Lane,International,2,"Two Melbourne natives bring Australian dining to the East Village with this whimsical bistro. Flinders Lane hosts a convivial set in a petite room that's trademark downtown, with its mix of industrial and rustic touches. A strong Asian accent is woven throughout the menu, which also hails inspiration from Australia's Greek and Italian immigrants. Moist seaweed combined with avocado, snake beans, and roasted red pepper is a pop of flavors, brightened by a soy sauce- and toasted sesame oil-dressing. Grilled naan with tandoori-style rabbit is especially tasty thanks to its marinade of spiced yogurt and quick-pickled green mango garnish. And for as refreshing a dessert as you're likely to ever come across, order the coconut jelly with watermelon.",0,0
249,Cafe Cluny,Contemporary,2,"This warm and cozy café flaunts its feminine persona with more than a touch of Village cool (and some occasional aloofness). There are ample windows for people-watching, or let your eyes wander to the botany drawings along the walls and bird sculptures decorating nooks. The Cluny burger accompanied by golden fries is a sure-fire hit; it arrives topless to showcase the perfectly charred and glistening meat. Once fully dressed with your choice of bib lettuce, tomato, and red onion slices, it literally drips with goodness-maybe right onto those beautifully crisped fries. Come dessert, go for a simple and outrageously good plate of biscotti, served in a ""jenga"" arrangement of bittersweet chocolate and walnut or pistachio and anise flavors.",0,0
250,Barraca,Spanish,2,"Spanish for ""shack,"" rustic Barraca charms with timber ceilings and vats of sangria behind the bar. Blue chairs pop against all the wood and brick, bringing a Mediterranean feel to the intimate space. Banquettes line one side of the restaurant, suggesting cozy evenings of sharing coca de atùn (flatbread pizza) or pan tomate.Empanadas are flaky and crusty, filled with thyme-laced beef, spring onion, allspice, and cheese. Classic croquetas are crackling outside and creamy within, resting on a dab of aïoli. But such snacks are just a prelude to the excellent paella; choose one version studded with shellfish and sweet peppers, or mix and match two or three different ""flavors."" Crusty churros finish off an evening of pure Spanish pleasure.",0,0
251,Kafana,Eastern European,2,"Traditional Serbian cuisine, a rarity in these parts, is the specialty at this heartwarming Alphabet City café. The intimate space is outfitted with exposed brick walls hung with mirrors and vintage photographs, rough-hewn wood tables, and boldly patterned banquettes. Carnations and votive candles pretty the room. Begin a meal with an assortment of air-dried or smoked meats and tall slices of savory pies like the gibanica stuffed with tart feta layered in excellent phyllo. Other authentic and hearty treats include c'evapi (grilled minced meat kebabs) as well as wonderfully rustic stews combining lamb and wilted spinach, or beans with smoked baby back ribs. Kafana's regional wine list features a selection of orange wines from Slovenia and Croatia.",0,0
252,Motorino,Pizza,1,"What started out as a Neapolitan-style pizzeria in Brooklyn has grown into a global chain with locations in Hong Kong and Manila. Cloaked in the scent of wood-fired pies, Motorino is praised as an all-day spot that's easy on the wallet. True, it may be smaller than the newer, slightly grander Williamsburg outpost, but these pizzas leave nothing to be desired. Blackboard specials convey the product-focused sensibilities that begin with a lunchtime prix-fixe pairing a green salad of mint, beet greens, and red onion in balsamic vinaigrette with a perfectly charred and chewy pie. The foundation of each pizza is its outstanding crust spread with crushed tomatoes, gobs of melting fresh mozzarella, and perhaps a generous layering of spicy sausage slices.",0,0
253,Blenheim,American,3,"When a restaurant sources ingredients from its own farm in the Catskills, it clearly takes its farm-to-table ethos to heart. Even the décor here at Blenheim reflects this philosophy by way of distressed wood paneling and a style that is far more country-cool than precious. Service is eager and just as committed to the chef's mission of presenting pure ingredients with progressive elegance. There may be no more genuine expression of this kitchen than the farm eggs, their yolk bright orange and fresh, set beside gently charred slices of hangar steak and fork-tender fingerlings. Silky foie gras torchon is finished tableside with refreshing tomato water; and dense, creamy quadrello di bufala with pistachio sable is a welcome stand-in for an arid bread pudding.",0,0
254,Momofuku Ssäm Bar,Contemporary,2,"Trust us, you need Momofuku Ssäm Bar in your life. Inside David Chang's perennial favorite, you'll find a hip, young crowd rubbing elbows at the minimalist bar or sinking into low-slung tables to chat up their dinner companions. It's a fun, convivial ambience, no question-but the star of the show here is indisputably Chang's singular Korean and Japanese cooking style, which flirts with European and Californian influences. There's perfectly sourced charcuterie and a lovely raw bar to kick things off, but don't leave without moving on to Chang's legendary pork buns-pillow-soft and laced with hoisin sauce, cucumber, and scallions. Or even a tender Flat Iron steak, grilled to perfection, and paired with chicharrón chips, ramps, and broiled asparagus tips.",0,0
255,Donostia,Spanish,1,"A little bite of Barcelona can be found just across from Tompkins Square Park at this bar de conservas. A mural depicting the Basque countryside frames the slender quarters. Most diners choose the marble counter seating, but there are also a handful of tables. An array of small bites makes up Donostia's menu. Find Spanish cheeses and charcuteria of Iberico pork, but the true star here are the conservas. To refer to these as canned seafood would be technically correct but improper- digging into a few is obligatory. Among the temptations, expect a delicate miniature tartalata filled with smooth sea urchin and toothsome octopus. Also try meaty chunks of oil-cured bonito with spicy salsa roja, potato chips, and mini loaf-shaped crackers called picos.",0,0
256,Good,American,2,"Creamy walls and lime green wainscoting frame this cozy and comfortable little slice of Americana that has been pleasing Greenwich Village residents since 2000. Good also happens to be great for date night-the intimate bar pours top-shelf spirits and the muted dining room is dressed with crisp white linens. Everything has a certain serenity, even when it's bubbling at happy hour. Chef/owner Steven J. Picker's menu puts his own signature on tempting seasonal cooking. Beautifully seared squid and Japanese eggplant grilled until silky are adorned with summer beans, cherry tomatoes, and mint. Turkey scallopini is crisp and light, set atop a bed of frisée, shaved celery, and ricotta salata. Long live the tortilla-crusted, jalapeño-kicked mac and cheese!",0,0
257,East 12th Osteria,Italian,2,"On the one hand, this is a straightforward little corner trattoria. On the other, Chef Roberto Deiaco's exciting cooking is a delicious presentation of Italian tastes and technique. The front of house is run by the chef's wife, who lends a personal and intimate air that's hard to fake and increasingly rare. The room glows with good vibes that radiate across the hardwood floor, marble bar, and tin ceiling. Contemporary highlights accent the Northern Italian-focused menu of fritto di mare neatly piling hot and delicately crisp calamari, red mullet, jumbo shrimp and a zucchini blossom. Tagliolini all'uovo is twirled with basil pesto, ricotta salata, and black truffle; and slowly braised veal cheeks are coddled with pinot bianco gremolata sauce and polenta.",0,0
258,Barbuto,American,2,"When New Yorkers dream of living in the West Village, Barbuto has a place in that dream, too. Springtime lunches with garage doors open to the sidewalk, and a feast of refined, simple dishes have earned Jonathan Waxman a devoted following in a neighborhood already full of charming restaurants. Casually professional service and the dimly lit dining room's dose of California cool enhance the experience. Barbuto's roast chicken deserves its legendary status, but other dishes tempt too. A cavolo nero salad of thinly sliced black kale and crunchy breadcrumbs tossed in a creamy dressing of anchovies and pecorino puts the average kale salad to shame. Linguini is coated with black pepper, egg, pancetta, and cheese in one indelible plate of carbonara.",0,0
259,Gnocco,Italian,2,"A casual cucina with a lovely back garden, Gnocco is a neighborhood staple with a homey touch. The restaurant charms with creaky wood floors and exposed brick walls accented by abstract paintings. The wood-burning oven at the entrance sets a warm tone, and greets guests with the heady aroma of freshly baked bread. The signature gnocco (sweet, salty pillows of fried bread) can be ordered as an appetizer, side, or even as a dessert with Nutella. Pizzas shine on this carb-centric menu, thanks to that blistered thin crust hanging over the plate's edge. The Amatriciana layers tart tomato sauce with sweet red onion, shreds of pancetta, and a heavy-handed sprinkle of red pepper flakes. The torta cioccolato with chocolate mousse makes a fine dessert.",0,0
260,Hearth,Mediterranean,3,"After more than a decade delighting fans, Chef Marco Canora and his dining room still have what it takes to impress Manhattan's fickle diners. The space remains fresh and welcoming, and the chef has added an adjacent bone broth kiosk, Brodo, which has converts lining up for their daily fix. Italian classics given a creative reworking are the key to Hearth's longtime success. Baccalà is used to compose roasted cod scattered with crisped bits of skin, silky chickpea purée, and garlic confit. Then veal-and-ricotta meatballs wrapped in slow-cooked tomato sauce are nestled in stone-ground polenta that is prepared cacio e pepe-style. And, desserts here are as enticing as the wines. Imagine a warm autumn fruit crisp, complete with pecan streusel and honey gelato.",0,0
261,Wallflower,French,2,"When a Daniel restaurant veteran opens a casual little cocktail lounge and dining room, the locals will come and never leave. Xavier Herit spent seven years as head bartender at the renowned spot, and his expertise clearly shows in the impressive wine list and complex cocktails-he even crafts a house-made pinot noir syrup for the Scotch-based Père Pinard. The prix-fixe is a true deal in this neighborhood, especially with choices from the raw bar and charcuterie. For heartier fare, try the country pâté or rabbit terrine, both classically prepared and perfectly seasoned. Silky beef short ribs are deeply comforting, garnished with bacon, mushroom, cipollini, and just the right amount of brawny sauce. The coffee-chocolate pot de crème is deliciously intense.",0,0
262,Gradisca,Italian,2,"If one could choose an Italian mother, it would be ""mamma,"" the pasta maker at Gradisca. Walking into this quaint brownstone is like taking a step into a trattoria in Emila Romagna, complete with Fellini posters, napkin-covered bread baskets, and a smiling bartender pouring a glass of violet-scented Sangiovese. Pasta plays front and center here and is luckily always handmade. Gorgeous, rose-shaped tortellini are stuffed with mounds of prosciutto and spinach, before being finished by a perfect plum tomato sauce. Secondi are also a must and may include the sublime cotoletta alla Bolognese, a perfectly breaded and pan-fried free-range chicken cutlet topped with a creamy truffle-béchamel sauce and served with a warm spinach budino.",0,0
263,Luzzo's,Pizza,2,"A treasured century-old coal oven is the heart of this quirky Neapolitan-style pizza parlor, lined with exposed brick, mismatched chairs, and kitschy knickknacks. Italian music plays softly beneath the buzz of this ever-busy restaurant, as loyal crowds wait patiently outside for the piping hot pies topped with melting mozzarella. A deep understanding of the art of bread baking is evident in every pie pulled from the coal-burning oven. The diavola features a tender, black-blistered crust topped with thin slices of spicy-salty salami, light and chunky tomato sauce beneath dollops of mozzarella. Round, square, and even puffy fried pies are all crafted with care at this convivial spot. For dessert, the zeppole di Nutella are an unabashed crowd-pleaser.",0,0
264,Balade,Lebanese,1,"Honing in on the cuisine of Lebanon, Balade is a welcoming and tasty Middle Eastern experience fronted by a cheerful red awning. The spotless room is accented with tile, brick, and wood; and each table bears a bottle of private label herb-infused olive oil. The menu begins with a glossary of traditional Lebanese ingredients and the explanation that Balade means ""fresh, local."" The meze; grilled meat-stuffed sandwiches; and Lebanese-style pizzas called manakeesh topped with the likes of lean ground beef, chopped onion, and spices are all fresh-tasting indeed. House specialties are also of note, like the mujaddara crush-a platter of lentils and rice topped with crispy fried onions as well as a salad of cool, chopped cucumber and tomato.",0,0
265,Au Za'atar,Middle Eastern,2,"Don't let the simple décor fool you-what this Arabian- French bistro lacks in ambience, it more than makes up for in mouthwatering Middle Eastern cuisine. The menu features such delights as lamb shank braised with Armagnac and prunes, delicious char-grilled meats, and many meze. Of course, every meal here begins with fresh, piping hot pita. Hot, tender, and brushed with olive oil, the bread is sprinkled with the namesake spice blend along with a hearty dollop of labne. Pair it with an appetizer of batin jan makdous, pickled baby eggplants stuffed with garlic-walnut paste, then move on to the kafta kebab. Juicy and well-seasoned, this charred ground beef skewer arrives plated with grilled tomato and onion, crunchy salad, and rice pilaf.",0,0
266,Northern Spy Food Co.,American,2,"This enticing Alphabet City café beckons with its countrified setting and fiercely ingredient-driven comfort food. Reclaimed hickory flooring and salvaged wood tabletops fill the petite room dressed with framed mirrors, vintage wallpaper, and a banquette painted robin's egg blue. The look is unbeatably quaint. The cuisine also happens to be innovative, as in a snack of pork sticky rolls swiped with parsnip glaze, or a first course of roasted sunchokes, fennel, and clementine sements pierced with dried black-garlic chips. The night's offering of organic-pastured local pork may reveal tender slices of pan-seared loin fanned over jalapeño cornbread that has been cooked down to ""polenta."" On Sunday nights, enjoy a three-course prix-fixe for under $30.00.",0,0
267,Pok Pok Ny,Thai,2,"Foodies flock to this penultimate scene not for the vibe, but for a profound understanding of Isaan culinary traditions. If pok pok means ""mortar and pestle"" then Chef Andy Ricker makes this utensil the foundation of his trademark cooking, which takes excellent local product and imparts it with American flair. The spacious room, outfitted with salvaged wood and exposed brick walls, is filled with a Brooklyn crowd. The kitchen has struggled with turnover and while some dishes remain solid as ever, others can disappoint. Top-quality boar collar coated in a flavorful rub of soy sauce, sugar, and spice is seared to chewy perfection before being coupled with cool mustard greens. Superb execution and pronounced flavors are clear in khanom jiin kaeng khiaw waan luuk chin plae, a tart and texturally exquisite green coconut curry floating with delicate fish balls and garnished with fried anchovies for unbeatable texture; and sai ua samun phrai or grilled Thai sausage accompanied by a spicy eggplant sauce, crispy pork cracklings, and a bouquet of long beans. Seal the deal with affogato-a shot of espresso poured over decadent condensed milk ice cream, which ensures nothing but sweet dreams.",1,1
268,15 East,Japanese,3,"A Japanese restaurant divided in two: you can perch at the counter and watch the sushi chefs in action or you can go next door and sit at a table in a slickly run, narrow room decked out in earthy tones. Either way, you'll be well looked after by an attentive team. The menu is also divided-between sushi and sashimi from the bar, and hot dishes from the kitchen. There is an impressive selection of the former, with the sashimi being particularly worthy. The hot dishes range from the traditional to the more innovative and adapted. Avoid the over-generously battered tempura and go instead for the soba noodles, made in house and served with a choice of topping such as uni or ikura, or the rich squid ink risotto with spear squid.",0,0
269,Tocqueville,Contemporary,2,"Be it lunch or dinner, few New York restaurants convey the civility found at Tocqueville, courtesy of Chef Marco Moreira and his wife Joann Makovitzky. The serene, butterscotch-colored room features spaciously arranged tables draped with starched linen and laden with sparkling cutlery and stemware. Tocqueville's location, just steps away from the Union Square Greenmarket, influences its seasonally driven menu. A salad of frisée, shaved celery, and roasted local pear arranged with slices of nutty Cato Farm cheddar is a delightful starting point. House-made silken tofu presented with ginger-infused mushroom broth demonstrates the kitchen's global inspiration. Excellent desserts may offer a candied chestnut Napolean garnished with brandy sorbet.",0,0
270,Untitled,American,2,"Who can outshine a world-renowned museum like the Whitney? Danny Meyer can-especially when his new restaurant, Untitled, is housed on site. Located by the entry to the popular High Line, the stunning, modern restaurant is a work of art itself, with floor-to-ceiling windows, sleek red chairs, and a beautiful semi-open kitchen. Talented Chef Michael Anthony oversees the operations here (chef de cuisine is Suzanne Cupps), and the results are anything but ordinary: witness a bright starter of marinated mussels with crisp fava, yellow eye beans and edible flowers; or a tangle of stradette tossed with broccoli rabe pesto, French beans, tender sweet mushrooms, and fresh cheese. Close with an ultra-decadent triple-layer peanut butter and blueberry crunch cake.",0,0
271,Crispo,Italian,2,"Convivial Crispo is a breath of fresh, rustic air. A protruding façade shelters its terrazza, while the back garden decked in smooth river stones feels warmer. The inside is dark and low-slung with brick walls, mosaic floors, and wrought-iron seats set around tiny, round tables. A plating station and kitchen reside in the back, as the full bar hums up front. Courteous waiters attend to neatly arranged tables groaning beneath refined yet peasant-hearty food. Angel hair pasta is twirled around fresh seafood and then tossed in a fresh cherry tomato-cream sauce. Three tender lamb chops scottaditto (glistening with an herb-olive oil marinade) and served beside a goat cheese-polenta cake, could be sealed with a kiss of passion fruit or coconut sorbet.",0,0
272,Coppelia,Latin American,2,"Think of ultra-casual Coppelia as a favorite anytime Latin-American diner, ready to please with its enormous menu served 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The space is long and narrow, including a counter for solo guests, checkerboard floors, and cheery yellow walls. Come midnight, the booths are hopping.The Havana salad has nothing to do with its namesake city but is an unbeatable combination of curly kale, queso fresco, toasted pepitas, crunchy mustard seeds, and tomatoes tossed in lemony vinaigrette. Crisp and flaky empanadas have both classic and quirky fillings, ranging from shredded chicken and chorizo to sweet corn. Save room for a towering slice of carrot cake featuring the unique twist of Manchego cheese and zesty lime frosting.",0,0
273,Santina,Seafood,4,"When life feels too monochrome, there is now a cure and its name is Santina. This Meatpacking hot spot, courtesy of Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi, and Jeff Zalaznick, is simply awash with color. From the waitstaff's polo shirts to the vivid, vibrant food, and even the bowls in which it's served, this kaleidoscope of sunny, southern European colors will simply make you feel better about life. It all happens in a glass box under the High Line designed by Renzo Piano-and Carmen Miranda would love the bar. Notionally described as ""Italian coastal cuisine,"" the food's about fish, vegetables, and sharing; and comes with an obvious health dividend. Be sure to start with cecina made with chickpea flour and try the surprisingly light rice and pasta dishes.",0,0
274,Virginia's,Contemporary,2,"Perfectly East Village in scale, this intimate yet ambitious bistro is composed of two slender rooms unified by butterscotch-colored banquettes and whitewashed brick walls hung with framed vintage menus. Fine stemware and items presented on wooden boards lend an upscale manner to the experience. Chef Christian Ramos takes risks while building upon a steady foundation from time spent as a sous chef at Per Se. A crostini of fava bean tapenade and shredded squash is a bright summertime treat-best paired with an icy glass of rosé. Pan-seared striped bass with new potato wedges is sauced with saffron-infused cockle broth; and the black-and-white sablé arranged with a taste of cocoa nib mousse and candied pistachios offers a sweet finish.",0,0
275,Paradou,French,2,"For a restaurant that refuses to take itself too seriously, the crowd-pleasing bistro cuisine here is no joke. At home along a cobblestoned street in the clubby Meatpacking District, Paradou offers a handful of tables and a stocked bar. Move past the vintage French liquor ads and down a brick-lined hallway to find a year-round back garden outfitted with chandeliers, a high glass roof, and tables crafted from vintage wine crates. The menu's foundation is Provençal cooking, but its lighthearted spirit feels free to stray. Begin with Amish bacon ""crack""-chili-spiked bacon jerky made from Pennsylvania Amish pigs. The duck breast is expertly seared, with crisp skin and a pink center. Don't skip the springy crêpes, filled with Nutella and ripe bananas.",0,0
276,La Vara,Spanish,2,"Set in quiet and charming Cobble Hill, La Vara is as alluring as its surrounds. Inside, hip urbanites get down to business around the sleek marble bar; while stroller-rolling parents might migrate to curved leather booths or nestle in the wooden alcoves up front. In the main dining room, white tables set with contemporary crockery offer just the right contrast to rustic brick walls. From soft lighting and personable service, to countrified food and inventive presentations, this convivial respite never misses a beat. Embark on a journey to culinary heights with the visually strange but wonderful tasting remojón featuring a scoop of house-cured salt cod mingled with orange segments, pistachios, and sliced green olives. Then, sail on to fideuà or Valencian-style noodle paella tossed with fresh, briny clams, tender squid, and a creamy aïoli. With luck on your side, cochinillo (slow-cooked, amber-hued suckling pig with crackling skin and rose-quince sauce) or tortillita de gambas accompanied by a pale pink shrimp pâté may star on the menu. If not, rest easy as you can still have your cake (or in this case an orange blossom-scented walnut tart finished with lemon curd and cream) and eat it too.",1,1
277,Blue Water Grill,Seafood,2,"This New York institution has become an iconic part of the Union Square landscape. The stately building is a former bank, with century-old architectural details and marble aplenty. As the name would suggest, the menu leans heavily on seafaring classics with an ample raw bar and sushi counter. But more than anything, this kitchen aims to please, with starters like pork belly sliders topped with tangy fennel-lettuce slaw on a brioche bun. Octopus tentacles are crisp yet perfectly tender inside, served resting atop chickpeas with a deep-red tomato and roasted pepper ragout infused with smoked paprika. Fish is always perfectly handled and often rises well above its accompaniments on the plate. Live jazz is a nightly draw to the downstairs lounge.",0,0
278,Union Square Cafe,American,3,"Sadly Danny Meyer's first born, which opened back in 1985 is due to close at the end of 2015, but thankfully it will relocate blocks away. With that in mind, this institution is sure to be mobbed until the end. Despite the usual crush, there are few other service teams better at making every diner feel like a cherished guest and there are few other bars more comfortable for solo dining. The menu is hailed for its broad appeal. Seasonal salads and starters include the fried calamari, while signature items like the yellowfin tuna burger are an all-time fave. Pastas are expertly prepared, as in the spaghetti Siciliano with swordfish meatballs and spicy tomato sauce. Memorable entrées reveval sea scallops wrapped in thin sheets of crisped and salty prosciutto.",0,0
279,Legend Bar & Restaurant,Chinese,1,"While Legend may offer a nice variety of Asian fare, just stick to the Sichuan specialties and be thoroughly rewarded. Find one of the many highlights in supremely flavorful and tender Chong Qing spicy chicken, loaded with viciously good dried chilies. The house duck is a traditional presentation of roasted and crisped meat with wraps as well as a host of accouterments, including crushed peanuts, fragrant herbs, scallions, and very tasty plum sauce. Bok choy with black mushrooms is a crunchy, simply delicious departure from the intensity of other dishes you may face here.The dining room has a certain hip and chic feel that fosters a lively happy hour scene. Colorful fabrics, striped walls, and statues of deities make for an attractive space.",0,0
280,Laut,Asian,2,"Laut is a unique Malaysian restaurant that is at once cheerful and authentic yet never challenging or inaccessible. It is likewise true to its downtown spirit, in a room that features dim lighting and exposed brick prettied with chalk drawings of orchids and water lilies. The personable staff and menu of Southeast Asian delights are as steady as the constant crowd. Popular choices include roti telur, a thin and slightly crisped yet pliable pancake stuffed with scrambled eggs, onions, and peppers, paired with fragrant chicken curry and coconut dipping sauce. The nasi lemak is a dome of coconut rice surrounded with sweet chili shrimp, hard-boiled egg, roasted peanuts, and dried anchovies for mixing into an outrageously good mélange of Malaysian flavors.",0,0
281,Casa Mono,Spanish,3,"Casa Mono is tiny, jammed, and totally New York. Furnished with a few closely packed tables that moan under the excess of mouthwatering plates as well as that mighty counter framed by a handful of seats, this grotto-like wine bar is loud, communal-and an absolute thrill. Then consider the service, which moves like clockwork and confirms that this is no slipshod show. The staff may be brisk in their presentation of the kitchen's ambitious renditions of tapas, but with flavors so delicious and concepts inventive, so be it. A faithful mix of locals and hungry out-of-towners convene for fantastic bite-sized eats like buttery bone marrow with smoked caper chermoulah-a house signature that is rich, flavorful, and entirely unmissable. Even the humble bacalao fritter attains new heights here as a deep-fried, fluffy delight coupled with sweet-citrusy alioli. Lastly, fallback plates like razor clams a la plancha in garlic-parsley sauce remain outstanding, consistent, and full of Spanish soul. This kitchen isn't frightened to explore, so skill and innovation are at the forefront of every morsel, including the thick, creamy, and luscious crema catalana con buñuelos. One word comes to mind: bliss. Oenophiles may head next door to drinking-focused sidekick, Bar Jamón.",1,1
282,Standard Grill,Contemporary,2,"Calling the Standard Grill a scene is an understatement. Tucked beneath the High Line in the hugely popular Standard Hotel, this clubby-chic grill blends black-and-white tiles, wood-framed windows overlooking Washington Street, and sidewalk seating with classic New York style. Modern downtown esthetics are reflected in their cadre of beautiful servers donning 1970s vintage plaid uniforms. Given its prime location, hip crowd, and sprawling layout, one might expect the food to falter but the culinary team doesn't disappoint. Baked macaroni hits a home run with its creamy blend of trumpet mushrooms, smoky roasted cauliflower, and tangy taggiasca olives; as does the Southern-style Atlantic swordfish, grilled and topped with a lemon- and green olive-salsa.",0,0
283,Alma,Mexican,2,"This festive stalwart with a renowned rooftop has come a long way since its early days along this rather unromantic waterfront. Mexican artifacts and mirrors line the brick walls of this multi-story spot with a margarita-fueled vibe and food that puts a smile on every face. Alma's pleasing Mexican cooking focuses on good, clean ingredient combinations in a nuanced menu of simple, flavorful dishes. Go for a delicious standard like plump, tender short rib enchiladas in soft, flour tortillas with roasted ranchero, Gouda cheese, and pumpkin seed sauces.

284,Aldea,Mediterranean,3,"A perfect climate and great scenery-it's easy to see the appeal of life on the Mediterranean. George Mendes' cheerfully run restaurant may not necessarily transport you there but you will leave here feeling as though your serotonin levels have received a timely boost. Those who like to eat whilst deciding what to eat should head straight for the appealing Portuguese selection of petiscos, or snacks-the croquetas de bacalhau and the Serrano ham are good. The main menu is seasonally pertinent and full of dishes to match that southern European climate: they are bright, sunny, and you feel they are doing you good. Nothing says the Med more than sardines-and here they come expertly filleted and dressed with dill and bronzed fennel. But even when the sun's gone down, the kitchen is equally adept at more warming, comforting dishes-try the venison with Swiss chard and chestnuts. The restaurant comes decorated with birch wood and shades of blue and is spread over two narrow rooms. Thanks to the open kitchen, the first floor has more buzz but if you're on a date, ask for the mezzanine level which is a little more intimate.",1,1
285,da Umberto,Italian,4,"There is a finely tuned harmony to dining at such classic New York restaurants as this one. The Italian menu is familiar and unpretentious, the kitchen is adept, and ingredients are superb. But, what truly sets it apart is an ability to serve exactly what you crave without seeming trite or predictable. Even the look is a perfectly conjured mix of warm neutrals with a sleek yet informal Northern Italian style and impeccably timed servers.Start with the traditional antipasto and then proceed to one of the daily specials like veal Milanese or a lavish dish of garganelli with mushrooms and black truffles. When the dessert cart rolls around, expect an array of excellent house-made sweets like pristine berries under whisked-to-order zabaglione.",0,0
286,Crema,Mexican,2,"Thanks to her perseverance, focus, and vision, Chef/owner Julieta Ballesteros has ensured that Crema remains ahead of the curve and at the top of her neighborhood. The long dining room is colorful, with a cactus garden, vibrant Latin music, and a semi-open kitchen for a peek inside the buzz, especially during happy hour when small plates are flying to the bar. Like the vibe, the cooking favors bold tastes over subtlety.Daily soups showcase careful execution-the chicken and rice may look simple but is spiked with lime and topped with cilantro and grated queso fresco for superb comfort. Alambres de filet mignon pleases with lime-marinated and buttery skewered meat, served alongside beer-battered onion rings and bright lemon-basil chimichurri.",0,0
287,Ootoya,Japanese,2,"This Japanese chain boasts more than 300 locations throughout Asia, and now claims three more here in the Big Apple. Thankfully the chic interior does nothing to convey chain dining. Instead, the look is understated with wood slats, ikebana, and muted tones. Ootoya's budget-friendly pricing ensures a full house. Hearty, home-style fare is the hallmark of their expansive menu of (mostly) cooked specialties. House-made tofu, rice bowls, fried free-range chicken with sweet-and-sour sauce, and pork katsu are but just a few of the product-focused items on offer. The lunch sets are an excellent value, built around fine quality fish such as saikyo miso-marinated grilled salmon with chawan mushi, steamed brown rice, and grains, accompanied by a heartwarming miso soup.",0,0
288,ABC Kitchen,Contemporary,2,"Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's signature dining chez ABC Carpet and Home began at this rustic yet glossy farm-to-table venue. A hit since opening, the room is an absolute scene. The pretty people are almost as pretty as the room. Service never impresses, but that is of little importance to this gregarious gaggle of devotees. Tables are accented with flowers and soy-based candles, which cast a glow on each plate. Expect the fresh flavors of ruby-red line-caught tuna sashimi marinated in ginger-soy sauce, sparked by fresh mint and red chili. Bowtie pasta with kasha and veal meatballs slicked with reduced, herb-infused jus is a hearty treat. Desserts may elicit cheers, especially the creamsicle tart-an orange-infused rendition of gâteau Basque.",0,0
289,The Gander,Contemporary,2,"This elegant companion to Chef Jesse Schenker's West Village hit, Recette, imbues each dish with distinct originality. The space flows from an inviting front lounge to a cozy back dining room, dressed with burlap ceiling pendants and ivory terrazzo flooring. Go for the four-course prix-fixe dinner to experience this clever and delightful cuisine. Creamy anchovy dressing and meaty bacon join in the chef's take on this classic reinterpretation of a wedge salad. Risotto-style beluga lentils balance intense mushroom stock with a subtle hit of jalapeños.

290,Sottocasa,Pizza,2,"Located just below street level on frenetic Atlantic Avenue, a nondescript façade holds a quiet den of serious Neapolitan pizza magic. Enter and you'll find a simple, narrow, wood-paneled room with whitewashed brick walls; a little bar showcasing a handful of wines; an enormous, two-ton clay oven (imported directly from Naples); and a little patio out back for alfresco dining. The mood is decidedly relaxed, and while there are delicious salads, antipasti, and desserts to be tried at Sottocasa, the name of the game here is undoubtedly their wickedly good pizza, served folded, blanche or rosse (with-hurrah!-a gluten-free option as well). Regulars adore the Diavola pie, which comes laced with excellent mozzarella, fresh basil, black olives, and hot sopressata.",0,0
291,Ki Sushi,Japanese,2,"Smith Street offers plenty of dining option to choose from, but Ki is this strip's sushi standout. Low-key and proffering good value, it is also a neighborhood favorite. At lunch, find downtown Brooklyn professionals taking a respite from the day's proceedings. At night, young couples and families routinely pack the room that brandishes a dim and earthy mien. Sample an array of cold and hot appetizers like yellowtail tartare with yuzu-ginger vinaigrette or rock shrimp tempura with creamy-spicy sauce. Follow this with creative maki, or better yet, the sushi deluxe platter. The skillfully constructed nigiri lineup features an array of fluke, sea bream, amberjack, and mackerel, as well as a roll stuffed with lean and deliciously unadulterated tuna.",0,0
292,ABC Cocina,International,2,"ABC Cocina stands in stark contrast to her wholesome and whitewashed cousin next door, ABC Kitchen. Markedly sexy, this space favors a vampy backdrop furnished with black and magenta lacquered café chairs and metal tables topped with red flowers and bottles of habanero sauce. Accents from Latin America and beyond lilt the menu of small plates, perhaps including sweet potato empanadas delicately crafted and imbued with smoked cherry pepper, paired with lemon yogurt sauce. Tamarind-marinated black sea bass is slender and neat with its lusciously crisped mottled skin still attached, dressed with tart juice and smoky-sweet chipotle barbecue sauce. The tres leches cake coddled with green apple foam and gooey cajeta is an illuminating finish.",0,0
293,Bocca,Italian,2,"This trattoria hits all the right notes-and throws in a few novel riffs-to make it as a neighborhood favorite. The Roman cuisine has few faults, and the comfortable setting feels genuine with its parchment-lacquered walls, displayed wine storage, and framed posters of Federico Fellini's classics. Bocca is owned by the team behind Cacio e Pepe in the East Village, so you can expect delicious and dramatically presented tonnarelli cacio e pepe. However, the talented kitchen offers temptations aplenty, such as a bowl of fresh, rich-tasting spaghetti alla chitarra brilliantly dressed with cherry tomato sauce and 'nduja. Twice-cooked pork belly with braised cabbage and celery mostarda is another fine example of their hearty, regional flavors.",0,0
294,Brucie,Italian,2,"Despite the tough guy name, this local canteen proudly claims the distinctly female touch of Chef/owner Zahra Tangorra. The pleasantly thrown-together space seats a diverse selection of patrons, many with kids in tow. Step in to find a smattering of tables, copper-topped dining counter, and shelves lined with canned products, jars, and bottles. Old-world inspiration combines with new-world sensibility and results in product-driven, mostly Italian creations like tagliatelle with Brussels sprouts, tomato butter, and house-made burrata. Then, savor the brined and barbecued chicken basted with earthy stout- and maple syrup-enriched sauce. Try the chef's signature lasagna service: drop off your empty pan and pick it up filled and ready to feed a crowd.",0,0
295,Craft,American,4,"It's been many years since super-celebrity chef and TV personality Tom Colicchio opened Craft to great acclaim. Its popularity hasn't waned and the room is filled nightly with casually affluent New Yorkers. Good looks and a committed service team are the top assets and the décor is timeless yet cozy, aerial yet intimate. Bare bulbs emit a glow over wood tables and that smug, handsome bar should be drawing more diners. The menu's forte lies in its meandering conceit, allowing guests to ""craft"" their own meal. Prices are aggressive and these pristine ingredients often plead for a bit more salt or a bit less cooking, but pastas and desserts are where this kitchen shines. A fall tagliatelle with a bath of white truffles is a stunning example of what's possible.",0,0
296,French Louie,Mediterranean,2,"From the team behind Buttermilk Channel, French Louie combines a candlelit vibe with rustic touches and a dominantly Mediterranean menu in a welcoming setting that's become the neighborhood hideaway. Whether you perch at the mahogany bar or in the spacious backyard, be sure to come hungry for the splurge-worthy cheese plate and profiteroles-golden, puffy and encapsulating a fennel pollen-flavored ice cream. For a dish to share, try the Le Grand Socca, not normally found outside Liguria (where's it's called farinata) or the South of France. A bit thicker than the traditional, this pizza-sized crêpe arrives topped with a shelled-bean stew, charred asparagus, freekeh, and spiced lemon yogurt, with just the right amount of smokiness from the skillet.",0,0
297,Cull & Pistol,Seafood,2,"Cull & Pistol is a sensational seafood spot. This breath of fresh salt-laden air is replete with reclaimed teak tables, brushed steel chairs, and a zinc-topped raw bar groaning with crimson-red crab claws, chilled lobster, shrimp cocktail, and clams from all shores.It's an impressive start tailed by a vast oyster menu and deeply comforting classics that may be slurped up at two-tops inside the cozy space. Then, a whole fish salt-baked in a hefty cask is cracked open, teasing diners with plumes of thyme- and lemon-scented steam. At lunch, the clambake is a briny, heavenly mash-up of lobster, mussels, Dickson's sausage, corn on the cob and fingerling potatoes, served family-style in a rich shellfish broth. Dessert is pure and sweet bliss.",0,0
298,Boqueria,Spanish,2,"Named after Barcelona's famed market, Boqueria does that vibrant emporium proud with an array of ingredient-driven tapas. Their tortilla Española is a true classic, served as a towering wedge of organic eggs, tender potatoes, and sweet onions. Kale reaches new heights as a sweet and earthy salad tossed with a rainbow of cumin-roasted carrots, toasted sunflower seeds, pomegranate arils, and a lush swipe of tangy labne. Bombas de la Barceloneta are crunchy, beef-stuffed potato croquettes plated with salsa verde and silken, garlicky aïoli. Envision high banquettes amid creamy hues, a white marble bar area filled with wooden boards of Spanish cheeses, olives in terra-cotta bowls, and crowds cooing over classic tapas like pan con tomate. Delicioso.",0,0
299,Gramercy Tavern,Contemporary,4,"In a roll-call of New York's most beloved restaurants of the last couple of decades, Gramercy Tavern would be high on many people's list. It is one of those places that manage the rare trick of being so confident in its abilities that it can be all things to all people. You'll probably leave happy whether you've come on a date or are here to impress the in-laws; whether you're closing a deal or simply lubricating the thought processes behind a deal. The ""Tavern"" side is the better one for lunch, especially if there are only two of you and you can sit at the bar-it doesn't take bookings so get here early and join in the grown-up ""I'm not really queuing, I'm just standing here"" queue outside. The ""Dining Room"" is for those who like a little more pomp with their pappardelle, and really comes into its own in the evening. The cooking is the perfect match for the warm and woody surroundings: this is American food sure of its footing and unthreatening in its vocabulary. The main component, be it sea bass or pork loin, is allowed to shine and there is a refreshing lack of over-elaboration on the plate that demonstrates the confidence of the kitchen.",1,1
300,Take Root,Contemporary,4,"If you're lucky enough to score one of the precious few seats here, make it your mission to arrive on time. The tasting menu's procession begins promptly, so stragglers run the risk of missing out on its first luscious bites-and to deprive yourself of a crunchy fennel pollen-dusted potato croquette would be nothing short of a culinary crime. Since this is strictly a two-woman operation, the military-like precision is easily forgiven. Chef Elise Kornack single-handedly runs the immaculate kitchen while her wife, Anna Hieronimus, congenially attends to the tranquil, intimate dining room. But, the team works in tandem when it comes to presenting the uniquely composed plates. Substitutes are not offered, but there's little chance you won't be happy with what's to come. Black garlic-glazed lamb's tongue anticucho is a stimulating opening act for a refreshing summertime composition of slivered snap peas, intensely flavorful tomato pulp, wild ginger, and a creamy drizzle of chocolate mint purée. The chef's style is a fresh and light approach to quality product as seen in asparagus dressed with oysters whipped into a froth or roasted local pork plated with diced celtuce and wild strawberries.",1,1
301,Craftbar,Contemporary,2,"Its ersatz industrial aesthetic and the rumble of the subway below combine to create a sense of energy and toil-although the service team can sometimes fail to embrace these concepts with any great vigor. But never mind because, as the name suggests, there's a big bar here, and a menu that has something for everyone. There is quite a pronounced Asian flavor in many of the dishes, such as the big bowl of PEI mussels with Kaffir lime, chili paste, and Sichuan pepper. Those, however, who prefer their culinary influences a little more homegrown, will find much comfort in the ""double stack"" burger. Anyone mindful of the heart-its health, not its emotional state-will be reassured by the presence of ingredients like kale on the menu.",0,0
302,Barbounia,Mediterranean,2,"Barbounia brings the pleasures of the Mediterranean to a primo locale. The welcome is warm, the ceilings are notably high, and the floor-to-ceiling bar is considerably stocked (note the wine list and its surprisingly large selection from Greece). The dining room is crowded with tables, so go for the cozy corner banquettes overlooking the action. The rustic, satiating fare is ideal for sharing. Thick pieces of octopus are grilled to a buttery softness and served over marinated chickpeas with olives, oregano, and a slick of labneh. In the shakshuka with merguez, a cast iron skillet arrives bursting with flavor and bubbling at the table with a piquant paprika-spiked tomato sauce topped with baked eggs and studded with roasted peppers and sausage.",0,0
303,Mari Vanna,Russian,2,"The bar is stocked with urns of house-infused vodka (apricot, seaberry, and cucumber-dill to name just a few) and the main dining room is often fully occupied by large groups. Despite the revelry, the ambience at Mari Vanna persuades its occupants to sit back and enjoy themselves in the shabby-chic room, done in a bleached palette complemented by embroidered seat backs and glowing chandeliers. Traditional Russian specialties abound with an Olivier salad, salo (house-smoked fatback), borscht, and plump pelmeni served with herbed butter and sour cream. The kitchen's serious effort shines through in entrées like golubtzi, featuring two neat bundles of braised cabbage stuffed with fragrant ground beef and rice, then draped with a lush coat of tomato cream.",0,0
304,Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare,Contemporary,4,"At 7:00 P.M. this storefront attached to a gourmet grocer turns into something conceptual and remarkable. Here, Chef César Ramirez-the bespectacled authoritarian-stands center stage, surrounded by sous chefs and state-of-the-art everything. He personally welcomes every guest to his ""table"" which is actually a gleaming steel counter surrounding his kitchen, where each copper pot is watched-over and every porcelain vessel is cooled or warmed to match the temperature of the food it holds. The bar for painstaking detail seems to rise with each dish. Expect a bang of flavor to open your meal, perhaps with a tart layering briny sea trout roe. Signatures like sea urchin piled over toasted brioche with a round of Périgord truffle never lose their impact. However, what was once an endless parade of seafood bites from faraway shores has grown and refined into equally lush mini-entrées. A square of Miyagi beef is whoa-inducing. Tiny wild strawberries, yogurt ice cream, and sake gelée balance each element with wondrous intensity. The menu changes every night, but Chef Ramirez never veers from his brilliant melding of French and Japanese cuisines with modern style that keeps pleasure at the forefront.",3,1
305,élan,Contemporary,3,"Diners of a certain age will remember Chef David Waltuck's trailblazing Chanterelle, which closed in 2009 after a commendable 30 years on the NYC restaurant scene. His new residence, housed in the former Veritas space has been tweaked to feature a gallery-style bar that showcases the works of emerging artists, plus a dining room of silver-striped banquettes and walls hung with foxed mirrors. Global accents influence much of the cooking, as in duck breast paired with crispy vegetable spring rolls and sauced with smoky jus. The pine nut-studded seafood sausage is a classic, plated with sauerkraut and grainy mustard beurre blanc, and a sundae of cherry pit-infused ice cream-complete with cherry sorbet and almond cake-is a shining example of seasonality.",0,0
306,Montmartre,French,3,"This dark, oh-so-Frenchy Chelsea charmer finds its culinary footing in Patrick McGrath's kitchen takeover-and the results are seriously delicious. Duck inside and you'll find a small, but sweet little spot to cool your heels in or, come summer, make your way back to the excellent (and intimate) covered back garden.Any place you land, you'll be treated to McGrath's spot-on dishes like an excellent brandade, whipped to salty, creamy perfection and topped with a layer of silky red pepper-infused olive oil; a well-spiced pâté de campagne served with grilled sourdough and pickled veggies; or a wildly fresh piece of salmon laid over a bed of sugar snap peas, crumbled French feta, pickled ramps, and laced with saffron aïoli.",0,0
307,Strong Place,Gastropub,2,"Strong Place is a Cobble Hill favorite for its epic beer list, which offers more than 20 brews on tap plus over ten bottled options. Kick back, unwind, and drink up; the vibe is chill, and chunky tables with metal seating render a comfortable, vaguely industrial look. The snacks pair perfectly with their frosty pints-imagine spicy duck fat edamame, Cajun boiled peanuts, or a platter of iced shellfish from the raw bar. Stay on for dinner, because the menu offers plenty of proper options. Smooth asparagus and fennel soup sprinkled with crushed bacon gains its silken texture from puréed red bliss potatoes; while the thick, juicy lamb burger is topped with creamy feta cheese and accompanied by sun-dried tomato ketchup and rosemary salt-tossed French fries.",0,0
308,Periyali,Greek,3,"Aegean sensibilities and vibrant Mediterranean flavors are dished out with panache at this Greek mainstay, in operation and thriving since 1978. A glinting school of abstract metal fish artfully commands one wall, while an intimate rear seating area glows like a pale pink sunset in the room's evening light. The petite space can get packed with a dressy, European crowd. First-rate cooking may begin with fresh and crisp horiatiki salata sporting creamy feta and powerfully fragrant dried oregano; or the small but pleasingly robust sikotakia me fakes, chicken livers sautéed with rosemary laid over a bed of lentils. The reliably decadent moussaka layers crisped potato slices, ground lamb, roasted eggplant, and béchamel so creamy that it verges on fluffy.",0,0
309,Mile End,Deli,1,"Boerum Hill's most bodacious deli serves up killer smoked meat and so much more. The tiny space gets lots of traffic, and those who can't find a seat along the counter or trio of communal tables can feast at home with takeout procured from the sidewalk window. Now for the food: a cured and smoked brisket sandwich, stacked onto soft rye bread and smacked with mustard, is the stuff that dreams are made of. Eclectic and vegetarian-friendly, the menu also reveals poutine (owner Noah Bernamoff is a Montreal native), roasted eggplant brik dotted with briny capers, pine nuts, and sweet raisins; as well as fresh-baked desserts like almond cake with house-made vanilla ice cream. Manhattanites take heed: there's a location now on Bond Street.",0,0
310,Cosme,Mexican,4,"Mexico's world-renowned celebrity chef, Enrique Olvera, has finally landed stateside, and the food world is justifiably abuzz. Tucked into a sleek, urbane space with warm light and concrete floors, Cosme's menu features small and large plates for sharing-and enough raw seafood to make Le Bernardin blush. Chef de cuisine Mariana Villegas oversees the execution with an eagle eye: a silky scallop aguachile is fanned out and topped with cool, poached jicama, serrano chiles, and fresh wasabi root; while a tender eggplant tamal arrives smoky-sweet and topped with house-made ricotta and a bright green herb sauce. Lastly, steak tacos are rubbed with black garlic and paired with chile slivers, blistered shisito peppers, and a smooth avocado-tarragon purée.",0,0
311,Almayass,Lebanese,2,"Armenian influences steer the Lebanese cuisine here to a unique and rather elegant place. While this family-run operation has numerous Middle Eastern locations, this is their sole U.S. outpost. Polished service befits the upscale room, installed with vivid artwork and tables generously sized for feasting. Beginning with a selection of fresh and flavorful meze is absolutely necessary. Cold options include kabiss, an assortment of spicy pickled vegetables; and moutabbal Almayass, a magenta-colored spread of mashed beets seasoned with sesame paste, lemon, and garlic. Or opt for hot, succulent, and traditional mantee-little pockets stuffed with beef, earthenware-baked, and doused with tart yogurt. A selection of Lebanese producers headlines the wine list.",0,0
312,Toro,Spanish,2,"Trendy location? Check. Sleek, warehouse-sized space? Check. Floor-to-ceiling windows filled with romantic sunsets? Check. In brief, Toro is a head-turner graced with intent service and extraordinary food. Begin with inventive (and strong) crowd-pleasing sips at the impressive bar before settling in to a comfy communal table.The music gets louder at sundown, but find yourself fixated on such deeply flavorful pinchos as sardina y mantequilla de cabra (crusty bread spread with goat butter and preserved sardines) or aged duck ham kissed with olive oil, lemon zest, and sweet, delicious fat. Links of smoky, tender chorizo set over chickpea stew is a comforting creation, while inky-dark sepia risotto en su tinta made with orzo is rich, buttery, and perfect.",0,0
313,Colicchio & Sons,American,3,"In front, the Tap Room pours an impressive roster of beers to go with pricey small plates. Beyond this, a dining room mixes chrome and a glass wine wall with leather banquettes and a birds-eye mural of the neighborhood. This layout almost recalls namesake Chef Colicchio's stint behind the stoves at Gramercy Tavern.Those neat stacks of chopped wood resting on polished shelves out front are analogous to the menu's ambition: relaxed, rustic yet very contemporary. Warm Parker House rolls are an auspicious prelude to ivory-pink hamachi set over beets with smoked crème fraîche. Fusilli with wild boar ragù and pecorino is nothing short of excellent. Consider going for the fixed menu; it just may cost less than ordering à la carte by the time the check arrives.",0,0
314,Socarrat,Spanish,2,"True, Soccarat is named for that ridiculously tasty burnished rice crust at the bottom of the paella pan. And yes, this place serves one of the city's best. The paella de la huerta with chicken combines spicy house-made chorizo, chickpeas, artichokes, tomatoes, and more in one traditional hot flat-bottom pan built for two (or more). However, there is much more on the menu to explore, especially during their highly regarded brunch-time feast of steak a la plancha with eggs, or an ensalada mixta tossing greens, asparagus, boiled egg, tuna, and olives.Glossy walls reflect the convivial room's gentle light, while mirrors and portraits lend depth and color. Communal tables are packed with your newest old friends and tapas-loving locals.",0,0
315,Ganso Ramen,Japanese,1,"A welcome sight amid the sneaker stores and pizza joints of commercial Fulton Mall, this friendly, comforting ramen-ya is a sure sign that things are changing in downtown Brooklyn. Inside, wood booths and tables sit atop stone floors while buzzing chefs are visible through encased glass. The same team has opened an equally appealing spot, Ganso Yaki, in Boerum Hill. Cookbook author and owner Harris Salat ensures that these steaming bowls of springy noodles remain a notch above those slurp shops opening throughout the city. Nightly specials are deftly executed, including a Mongolian lamb ramen in chili-sansho broth topped with slices of lamb, fried onions, garlic chives, and ajitama egg. Try pillowy steamed buns stuffed with pork belly or tangy duck.",0,0
316,Del Posto,Italian,4,"In a city like ours, there should be room for all types of restaurants-and that includes those of a more traditional persuasion. The exquisitely attired Del Posto is unashamedly Old School and comes with an expanse of mahogany, acres of marble, and rows of immaculately set tables; you also get a pianist and a veritable army of servers holding down various ranks. In surroundings of such grandeur, it's easy to assume the food will play second fiddle but that would be a mistake because the Italian food here is very good indeed. The menu layout and pricing can be a little bewildering at first but what becomes abundantly clear is that this is a well-orchestrated kitchen and one which demonstrates considerable skill and plenty of genuine care. Fish fin crudo is a great way to start; pasta dishes are surprisingly robust and generously proportioned; and entrées such as lamb with figs come with an awareness of contemporary tastes. Although pastry chef extraordinaire Brooks Headley has left, his signature desserts remain an immortal highlight on Del Posto's menu. The only thing here you'll find difficult is in believing this place is barely over a decade old.",1,1
317,Maialino,Italian,2,"Maialino is a trattoria, but only in theory. As the dining room of the Gramercy Park Hotel designed by the Rockwell Group, and overseen by service maestro Danny Meyer, there's nothing rustic or humble about it. The setting buzzes from day to night, and has established itself as a preferred watering hole for every sort of influencer. Chef Nick Anderer's menu of Roman-inspired delights brings the upscale scene down to earth with an assortment of hearty preparations, like unctuous honeycomb trippa alla Trastaverina braised in a spicy tomato sauce. Enticing pastas include fat tubes of paccheri dressed with silky white beans, pleasantly bitter escarole, and a touch of rosemary. Come dessert, the curiously light ricotta-based panna cotta cannot be missed.",0,0
318,Rocking Horse Cafe,Mexican,2,"A Chelsea classic since 1988, this Mexican café has a split personality. The front room-with vibrant orange walls, glowing lanterns, bare tabletops, and a long bar-is a bright, casual place to sample tequila cocktails or crunch into handmade tortilla chips and smoky salsa. Beyond a blue mosaic wall, the back room is a down-to-earth dining spot with a relaxed feel.The distinctive menu includes the likes of cordero enchipotlado, chipotle braised lamb shank with caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, and epazote over a creamy bed of cotija-spiked polenta; or blue corn crepas de pato stuffed with duck confit. The wise diner who ventures beyond commonplace dishes here is rewarded with complex, from-scratch cooking with soul.",0,0
319,Novitá,Italian,2,"This delightfully unpretentious trattoria is located on the ground floor of an art deco residential building that dates back to 1928. Novitá may have only opened in 1994, but elegant touches honor its tony Gramercy locale, with flowers dressing up the interior and canvas umbrella-topped tables outside. The dining room combines large, bright windows with pale yellow walls and a warm, autumnal-hued banquette. The staff's air of friendly formality suits the room. Enjoyable house-made pasta might feature strozzapreti tossed in fragrant basil pesto. Equally pleasing is a salad of rucola, avocado, and warm calamari. Other options include entrées like the black pepper-crusted tuna with lemon sauce, or a bittersweet chocolate-speckled semifreddo for dessert.",0,0
320,Prova,Italian,2,"Good looks run in the family, as this former Donatella space has been reimagined into the rustic, charming Prova. Donatella Arpaia proves there is still room for more pizza in New York, especially when sourcing superior ingredients and committing to Neapolitan pizza excellence. Distressed wood planks, brick walls, and a flaming red pizza oven set a cozy stay-a-while scene.Ingredients steal the show, many D.O.P. straight from Italy. A meal could begin with a classic like silky parmigiana di melanzane or you could launch right into the pizza. Slow-kneaded dough with a long fermentation results in a luscious pie, with crisp, minimally charred edges. The darling Romana is topped with fior di latte, San Marzano tomatoes, meaty anchovies, olives, and torn basil.",0,0
321,Clover Club,American,2,"A former shoe store is now an atmospheric rest stop that fashions a spot-on vintage vibe with mosaic-tiled floors, glove-soft leather banquettes, and pressed-tin ceilings dangling etched-glass pendants that glow as warmly as single malt. The glossy mahogany bar (furnished with leather-upholstered bar stools) is overseen by natty bartenders artfully shaking and pouring a stellar selection of libations like the namesake Clover Club-a mixture of gin, dry vermouth, lemon, and raspberry syrup. An excellent savory carte is a perfect counterpoint to such liquid indulgences. Highlights may include herb-marinated hanger steak over toasted baguette spread with horseradish cream; duck fat-fried potato crisps; oysters on the half-shell; and American caviar service.",0,0
322,Naka Naka,Japanese,3,"Like a graceful ballet, Naka Naka's kimono-draped servers, lustrous pearl-hued lanterns, and elegant calligraphy create a dance that instantly transports you from Chelsea to Japan. Housed in a timeworn tenement building amid gleaming high-rise condos, the soothing atmosphere draws a largely urban crowd, slung in the low wooden seats of this hidden gem.There is a melody to the food as well, beginning with aged, unfiltered sake. Dishes include cold soba topped with flaky fish tempura and the signature Naka Naka box, an ever-changing selection of exceptional tempuras, rice, and miso-dressed tuna. Salty, briny, mouth-coating flavors soon climax with bites of the vibrant sea urchin and downright perfect salmon roe sushi, worthy of its own Kyoto temple.",0,0
323,Salinas,Spanish,3,"Salinas is undeniably sexy. Step beyond the wrought-iron gates and squeeze your way past the bar to find the dusky scene.

A retractable glass roof shields the attractive Brazilian walnut floors and limestone walls from outside elements.The Spanish cuisine of Chef Luis Bollo, a native of San Sebastián, sparkles with coastal influences.

324,BLT Prime,Steakhouse,3,"Prime Angus beef broiled at 1700 degrees fahrenheit, dabbed with herb butter, and presented on sizzling hot cast iron is the reason this Gramercy steakhouse continues to bask in unbridled success. Power brokers are found unwinding at the bar and downing classic cocktails before settling into taupe banquettes trimmed with gleaming zebrawood tables. The menu is printed on brown craft paper, but is also grandly displayed on a huge wall-mounted board. Steak may be the most popular option, but this kitchen's talent runs deep. Sautéed Dover sole with soy-caper brown butter is a favorite among seafood fans.

325,Tipsy Parson,American,2,"The masculine bar shelved with books and premium spirits, dining room bric-a-brac, and French doors overlooking a garden clearly convey familiar, homey comfort. Dining here is like visting at an old friend's house, starting with drinks in the living room and ending on the back porch. But with much better food.The chive buttermilk biscuit is a distinctive, flaky force to be reckoned with. Clear Southern flavors are further explored with sour pickles and thick slices of green tomatoes both dredged in cornmeal and deep-fried to piping hot perfection, served with buttermilk dressing, avocado salad, tomato jam, and hatch chile salsa. Small plates like ""big damn shrimp"" do not disappoint, but save room for the superb cornflake-topped crumble for two.",0,0

The range of fascinating creations also includes Mexican steak tartare dressed with pickled jalapeños, tequila, and capers; as well as the Cantina cassoulet comprised of black beans and chicharrónes.

328,Diner,American,2,"Williamsburg's restored 1920s-era diner is a modern day hipster hangout complete with swivel stools lining the counter and wood-slat booths in the dining room. In lieu of a menu, the cool-looking servers handwrite Diner's concise carte directly onto paper-topped tables, all the while explaining each item in detail. A fried chicken sandwich or grass-fed burger are thoroughly appropriate fare for the setting, but it's the less expected plates that really wow. Take for example the grilled chicory, served charred and wilted, and plated with a fluffy dollop of ricotta cheese, crispy bacon lardons, and toasted walnuts. An equally impressive fillet of pan-seared trout boasts caramelized cipollini onions, poached currants, and a smear of strained yogurt.",0,0

A stark white palette complements the setting's industrial bones, which even made an appearance in an episode of The Good Wife. 1 or 8's kitchen turns out impressive cooked food organized as small plate appetizers.

Score a seat, request the omakase, and revel in the pieces Chef Kazuo Yoshida sets before you.

Dark miso soup poured over house-made tofu concludes the admirable meal.",0,0

As expected of a restaurant named for ""beef"" in Italian, Manzo serves up a meaty take on its country's cuisine.

House-made tagliatelle is twirled with olive oil-poached goat shoulder and black-truffle butter.

Caserecci tossed with petite, al dente cauliflower florets, capers, currants, and a showering of crunchy breadcrumbs is a treat. Choosing the smaller portion size allows for more room to enjoy the lamb duo-rare seared loin and slow-braised belly-composed with a chickpea-and-piquillo pepper stew slicked with gorgeous lamb jus.

332,Rucola,Contemporary,2,"Nestled among the brownstone-lined streets of beautiful Boerum Hill, this inviting trattoria is open all day. Rucola's attractive interior rocks that prototypical rusticity of reclaimed wood and aged mirrors, while tables are set with sprigs of fresh wild flowers.

334,Enoteca on Court,Italian,1,"This Carroll Gardens wine bar is a fresh-faced take on la Cucina Italiana, almost in spite of its location next to the old-school stalwart Marco Polo. Slim, spare, and dishing out wood and brick details, the cozy spot accommodates neighborhood crowds at its L-shaped bar leading to the open kitchen and on to a handful of tables in the back. A wood-burning oven brings a distinct personality to a range of specialties here like pizzas, baked pastas, and spiedini (skewered meat or seafood). The piping-hot panini are always a treat, made from a slab of fresh pizza dough that's crusty yet moist within, stuffed with sweet sausage, melted fresh mozzarella, a drizzle of olive oil, and tender broccoli rabe. The possibilities and tempting combinations are endless.",0,0
335,Aurora,Italian,2,"This charming trattoria has long been a popular dining choice for residents of this dynamic stretch of Williamsburg. Stocked with wood furnishings, the rustic brick and plaster room is dressed up with vintage knickknacks and features a pretty ivy-covered outdoor area that doubles the seating capacity of the corner setting. Aurora's enjoyable Italian cuisine speaks to the power of simplicity with minimally dressed market greens, expertly prepared pastas, and roasted meats. One can't go wrong with a meal of plump house-made sausage with lightly sautéed broccoli rabe and pickled Calabrian pepper; silky agnolotti stuffed with ricotta, spring peas, and fresh mint; or affogato with chocolate crumb-coated vanilla gelato, all offered at impressive value.",0,0
336,Foragers City Table,Contemporary,2,"Chef Nickolas Martinez flaunts his pedigree with intensity at this homage to all things local and organic. The restaurant-cum-market is an offshoot of an independent grocer in DUMBO, though its kitchen philosophy seems to have arrived via California.Inside, the boxy dining room radiates functionality through large, unemcumbered windows and hardwood tables. It is staffed and patronized by the sort of local-loving sycophants who consider it an honor to dine here. And it actually is.Begin with Sfoglini trumpets generously bathed in a luxurious lamb Bolognese with tender broccoli rabe and earthy brown beech mushrooms. Unabashed spice tingles with every slurp of clear sweet shrimp- chicken- and herb-filled dumpling soup.",0,0
337,Cafe El Presidente,Mexican,1,"With its colorful interior signage and indoor/outdoor aesthetic, this tasty taqueria near Madison Square Park could easily pass for a Mexico City hot spot. Soaring ceilings cover an open kitchen and tortilla-production station where disks of masa-the foundation for an enticing lineup of tacos-are turned out at a steady clip. Cafe El Presidente's attention to both quality and creativity is impressive, and proof is in the tacos especiales: wilted Swiss chard combined with roasted poblano chiles and sautéed yellow onion; or a spread of black bean purée topped with diced roasted sweet potato and dusting of cotija. For the ultimate conclusion, go for Gringa Madison, a rich pairing of pork al pastor and melted Chiuhuahua spiked with freshly chopped cilantro.",0,0
338,Eleven Madison Park,Contemporary,4,"Chef Daniel Humm's cooking is clever, innovative and at times even a little whimsical; it is robust when it needs to be but also delicate at times and it is this variety and depth that really sets it apart. No menu is presented; instead, you're merely asked to relay your list of allergies as though talking to your pharmacist and your work is done. The 15 or so courses that subsequently appear could be playful, like the carrot tartare made at the table, or display extraordinary understanding of technique, such as the dry-aged veal with bone marrow. The restaurant is housed within the sort of grandeur that could only ever have belonged to a financial institution. It's a hard space to fill-conversations don't so much hang in the air as float up to the vast ceiling and never return. But somehow the room's sheer scale and the well-spaced tables allow you to feel cocooned in your own world. Considerable help comes courtesy of the engaging staff as they explain each dish in loving terms but without ever sounding too virtuous. They also know when to talk and when to leave you to get on with enjoying yourself.",3,1
339,The Little Beet Table,American,2,"The product-focused, gluten-free food popularized by the fast-casual Little Beet now has a more elegant home in this Gramercy dining room outfitted with potted greenery and bold pieces of artwork. It should come as no surprise that the beets are divine, whether in a salad of tender grilled wedges plated with strained yogurt, savory pumpkin seed granola, and young arugula; or used to brightly tint a creamy risotto topped with carrot purée and whipped ricotta. But while lovingly prepared vegetables make a strong showing on the menu, it's not all rabbit food here. Other recommendations include tuna tataki dressed with a charred jalapeño vinaigrette; and salmon, cooked so gently it's positively silken, plated with a creative interpretation of caponata.",0,0
340,Cookshop,American,2,"Airy, sun-flooded, and in a location that still manages to seem brand-spanking new, Cookshop brings highbrow dining to western Chelsea. The plant-filled dining room is furnished with ethically sourced American oak tables and spotlights a wall of banquettes. The bar is perfect for solo dining.The kitchen drives this locavare philosophy with energy and skill. A cooling late-summer tomato soup is a smooth balance of sweet and tart flavors, enhanced with tangy lemon-basil and riesling. House-made lasagnette highlights the best of the season with high-minded Italian style, through tight, wavy ridges of pasta beautifully dressed in delicate pesto. Save room for sweet treats like a peanut butter Bavarian with Concord grape granite and milk ice cream.",0,0
341,Junoon,Indian,3,"Attention to detail is what sets Junoon far apart from its desi brethren. The façade is dramatic, but once through those ebony doors, the cavernous setting is welcoming and plush with treasures from the subcontinent. The large bar exudes class and fun, with two antique jhoolas (swings) crafted from Burmese teak. Then, walk through a 200-year-old wooden arch and carved panels beyond, seemingly afloat in a reflecting pool, to enter the amber-tinted dining room where tables are luxuriously spaced. The kitchen is patently ambitious and quite successful in presenting a contemporary vision of Indian cuisine. Every dish is thoughtfully composed and highlights only products of top quality. Begin with a thick octopus tentacle sent to the tandoor, emerging crisped, charred, incredibly tender, and served with pickled purple potato as well as herb oil. Murg lababdar tastes of pure elegance in seared and braised de-boned chicken drenched in a sweetly spiced, deeply flavored tomato-onion gravy. The creamy and exceedingly juicy shahi lamb shank is enriched with rose petal-garam masala, cumin, and coriander; while stout cake coddled with orange- and pink peppercorn-meringue is as unexpected as it is divine.",1,1
342,Blossom,Vegan,2,"Unpretentious and welcoming, this is a vegan favorite with spot-on spicing and delicious surprises. The cream-colored interior is dim with dark velvet curtains and votive candlelight reflected in round mirrors. The vibe may seem moody come evening, but the staff is always warm and affable. Huge portions and the bold flavors of smoked tempeh, spinach, pine nuts, and cremini mushrooms prove the power of vegetables to dedicated carnivores. Follow this with meaty and woodsy grilled seitan, glazed with violet-mustard and served over a mélange of roasted salsify and sautéed kale surrounded by horseradish cream. Come dessert, try the hand-churned cashew ice cream or a lemony cheesecake with a mixed berry reduction and coconut-cookie crust.",0,0
343,Pastai,Italian,2,"To call it simply an ""artisanal pasta bar"" would be selling Pastai short. It also happens to be attractive and thoroughly likable, repurposing milk bottles as water pitchers and displaying bright flowers, pennytiles, and wainscoting beneath its vintage ceiling. Wooden communal tables enhance the very pleasant atmosphere.The white-tiled kitchen and pasta station are front and center, keeping the menu's focus on everyone's mind. Tart and aromatic fresh-lemon pasta arrives twirled in a sort of broccoli rabe ""pesto"" with roasted tomatoes and creamy burrata. Handcrafted ravioli are so delicate and translucent that snips of asparagus and ricotta stuffing appear milky-green. Desserts like the lemon-olive oil cake are deliciously simple.",0,0
344,Lulu & Po,American,2,"Nestled around the corner of an otherwise forgettable street lined with bodegas, somewhere between Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, the Lilliputian Lulu & Po carries a sweet name but a big foodie punch. For that reason alone, you'll battle neighborhood regulars for a table or spot at the bar, but you'll probably have a grand time doing it. For the uninitiated, the setup is simple: you walk in, wait for a seat at one of the few tables that run the length of the room, and order from an ever-changing menu filled with delights. Try the creamy chicken liver pâté punched up with savory pancetta; tender grilled octopus with minty cilantro-jalapeño sauce; or a juicy half-chicken marinated with bright spices, then seared to perfection under the weight of a cast-iron pan.",0,0
345,Hill Country Chicken,American,1,"Gussied up in a happy palette of sunny yellow and sky blue, this 100-seat homage to deep-fried down-home country cooking serves exemplary fried chicken offered in two varieties. The ""classic"" sports a seasoned, golden-brown skin; ""Mama El's"" is skinless and cracker-crusted. Both are available by the piece or as part of whimsically named meals, like the ""white meat solo coop."" Step up to the counter and feast your eyes on cast-iron skillets of chicken, as well as sides like creamy mashed potatoes, pimento macaroni and cheese, or grilled corn salad with red peppers and green onion. And then there's pie. More than 12 assortments, baked in-house and available by the slice, whole, or blended into a milkshake for a drinkable take on ""à la mode.""",0,0
346,La Superior,Mexican,1,"This south Williamsburg taqueria is as loved for its lip-smacking selection of tacos as it is for its budget-friendly prices and rock star vibe. A handful of tables add seating beyond the tiny bar, decorated with vintage wallpaper, brightly painted chili-red walls, and a mounted Mexican flag. Tacos anchor La Superior's menu, and include lengua, creamy rajas, or carne asada to be wrapped in excellent tortillas. However, other options also tempt like the torta ahogada-a ""drowned"" sandwich served as toasted sourdough bread stuffed with roasted pork drenched in chile de arbol and tomato sauce. A specialty of Guadalajara, the cebollitas cambray is a great side dish made with fat scallions that have been grilled until blistered, tender, and sweet.",0,0
347,A Voce Madison,Italian,3,"Sporting that perfect confluence of casual ease and upscale elegance, this modern beacon of Italia in the city is the preferred table for the Flatiron's stylish set. The chic, sleek interior boasts walnut floors, cognac leather chairs and abstract art, while a greenery dressed sidewalk seating area offers alfresco dining overlooking Madison Square Park. A Voce Madison's kitchen has been steadied of late, and its contemporary spirit remains intact. Handmade pastas can feature ricotta and nettle-filled cappellacci drizzled with brown butter, while heartier options include a grilled pork chop with pickled rhubarb and kale three ways. For the uptown crowd, sister restaurant A Voce Columbus presents a similarly themed menu in the Time Warner Center.",0,0
348,Meadowsweet,Mediterranean,2,"One of Brooklyn's most beloved venues, this chill yet sophisticated destination is illuminated by a soaring glass-fronted façade, whitewashed brick walls, and reclaimed pine furnishings. While the original mosaic-tiled floors lend a stunning, old-timey accent that hearkens back to the building's former life as a printer's shop built in the late 19th century, Meadowsweet is clearly rooted in the present day thanks to Chef Polo Dobkin and his skilled team. Best described as enticingly familiar and temptingly novel Americana with whiffs of the Mediterranean woven throughout, the menu is a delight every time. Each composition is beautifully plated, as in a bowlful of egg-rich tajarin slicked with intoxicating black truffle butter and served with frilly bits of sautéed hen-of-the-woods mushrooms as well as a showering of grated parmesan. A meaty block of wild halibut is expertly seared, presented cracker-crisp skin side up, and adorned with morels, asparagus, and pea shoots-or whatever the season's finest produce happens to be. Desserts are equally impressive, like the homespun but sophisticated cylinder of warm blueberry crumble presented with lemon curd and ice cream.",1,1
349,Upland,Contemporary,3,"An Avengers-like lineup unites Chef Justin Smillie, restaurateur Stephen Starr, and design firm Roman Williams to bring fabulous California-style dining to this stretch of Park Avenue South. Upland positively glows from its burnished wood furnishings, glossy cream-colored walls, and polished copper pipe shelving stocked with backlit jars of preserved lemons. The kitchen sends out much to love, with Mediterranean and Italian accents to keep it all very interesting and delicious. Estrella pasta, star-shaped rigatoni dressed with crushed chicken liver, herbs, and pecorino, is a savory delight; crackling skin pork belly is seasonally plated with kale, blistered shisito peppers, and fuyu persimmon; and the yuzu soufflé with kalamansi curd is phenomenal.",0,0
350,Hill Country,Barbecue,2,"Manhattan's Hill Country offers as succulent a barbecue experience as one can hope for without actually stepping onto the rolling hills of central Texas. This rollicking roadhouse proudly displays its Lone Star heritage throughout; the lower level doubles as a live country music venue and the ground floor is arranged with counters dispensing the mouthwatering victuals. Consider your meat options, but don't fret 'cause it's all good, whether you choose lean (or moist) brisket, pork ribs, or smoked chicken to name just a few of the treats. Have your meal ticket stamped, then pick from a plethora of sides and sweets to complete your meal. Downtown Brooklyn recently welcomed its own Hill Country Barbecue, adjacent to the Hill Country Chicken offshoot.",0,0
351,Bread & Tulips,Italian,2,"A cordial greeting and personal escort down to this lower level Hotel Giraffe dining room is a promising start to an inspired meal. Exposed brick, darkly polished wood, and smart arrangements create an air of seclusion to match the room's contemporary good looks (never mind the low ceiling and lack of windows). The menu offers an array of brick oven-baked pizzas as well as small plates of au courant Mediterranean cooking like homemade organic ricotta and grilled octopus. A chilled beet salad mixes creamy goat cheese, young watercress, pink grapefruit, and toasted pistachios. Freshly made pastas are known to gratify, especially the pristine squid ink tagliatelle with tender calamari, diced chorizo, herbed breadcrumbs, and white wine salsa bianco.",0,0
352,Dover,Contemporary,3,"Creative global accents are the guiding force behind the enticing lineup of plates at this tastefully spare candlelit bistro. Chefs Walker Stern and Joe Ogrodnek (the duo behind Battersby) prove the world is their oyster-raw or broiled and seasonally embellished to kick things off-so settle in and expect to be impressed. Sweet watermelon aguachile is boldly dressed with fresh lime juice, spicy green chiles, blistered shisito peppers and hit of feta; while house-made links of merguez are nestled in a thick and creamy chickpea purée dotted with plumped golden raisins and accompanied by perfectly puffy wedges of hot pita. Dessert is delicious and seasonal: picture a summery olive oil cake plated with white peach semifreddo and verjus gelée.",0,0
353,Maysville,American,2,"Just as the Ohio River that ran through Maysville, KY, allowed for the town's Bourbon to be relished by the rest of the world, this NYC namesake is a mecca for sips and celebrations. An amber-hued glow bathes the American whiskey temple, pivoted around an imposing, marble-topped bar. Gilt-edged mirrors offer a glimpse into the dining room, framed by vibrant ceilings. Inventive cooking is the name of this skilled kitchen's game and may include roasted squash served with fresh ricotta and garlic-infused cilantro pistou. Whole smoked trout is grilled to crisp perfection before being garnished with red onion, pickled mushrooms, and watercress. Service is engaged all through dessert-a tart goat milk cheesecake with buttermilk granite is a combo to die for.",0,0
354,Saravanaas,Indian,1,"This Curry Hill branch of the international chain Saravana Bhavan is one of the neighborhood's most popular dining spots. The monochromatic white interior has taken a beating over the years, but that's easy to look past when the eats are as cheap and tasty as these. The completely vegetarian menu is an authentic array of curries, breads, and weekend-only biryani, but the real head-turners are those table-long dosas. They arrive as crisp, tactile favorites on a metal tray ready to be picked apart and dunked into luscious sambar and fresh-tasting chutneys. The milagaipodi onion dosa, a crispy rice-and lentil-flour crêpe spread with dried spices and a deliciously offensive amount of chopped red onion, is just one of many worthwhile treats.",0,0
355,Hanjan,Korean,2,"This contemporary take on Korean cuisine mimics the theme of Chef Hooni Kim's Hell's Kitchen trailblazer, Danji. A convivial crowd gathers along a cluster of tables in the petite space where ivory ceramic pieces are set against grey walls. Small plates arranged as ""traditional"" and ""modern"" highlight quality ingredients and stimulating presentations. The signature house-made tofu is unmissable: these chilled scoops of quivering soybean curd are a toasty shade of brown, sprinkled with slivered green onion and sesame seeds, and accompanied by soy sauce and perilla vinaigrette. Lunch is limited to a handful of starters, bi bim bap, and popular noodle dishes, perhaps mixing pork belly and vegetables doused in black bean sauce. Dinner is a better bet.",0,0
356,Peter Luger,Steakhouse,4,"Venerated Peter Luger resides in an expansive space reminiscent of old New York and early German ale houses-an endless line of visitors only serves to reiterate how special a place this truly is. Add to that a series of imposing pane windows, wood-paneled walls, and decorative old steins, and find yourself utterly smitten. Begin with thrillingly fatty, thick-cut bacon nearly sweet on the outside, or shrimp cocktail in a rich tomato dressing. But, what truly leaves diners speechless is that delightfully succulent Porterhouse for two, three, or four. These slabs of beautifully naked meat are simple but their marbling is a thing of complexity and perfection, sizzling in drippings. The wedge salad sets a new standard: it is an enormous and crisp slice of iceberg drowned in blue cheese dressing, chopped tomato, and more bacon. The carnivorous feast is complete when sanctified by crispy French fries or excellent creamed spinach. Properly prepped servers are cordial, yet informal and never chatty. A hunk of NY cheesecake, creamy, tart, and served with schlag, is every bit as classic as one imagines. Equally marvelous and dressed to the nines is a ""Holy cow sundae""-the title speaks for itself.",1,1
357,Kao Soy,Thai,1,"The flavors of Northern Thailand are sparkling and alive at this Red Hook hangout, featuring a bright, basic, and brick-walled dining room. Inside, tables loaded with vibrant dishes flaunting heightened levels of fire are bound to tingle palates and tempt passersby. Kao soy, the famous curry from Chiang Mai, is a signature for fitting reason. Topped with crispy egg noodles, this combo unites dark meat chicken, egg noodles, crushed peanut, and lime. A tart green mango salad mingled with crispy anchovies and sweet cashew nuts is a delight on its own; while banana blossom fritters should be dunked in thick peanut-chili sauce for more flavor. Bitter melon soup served with a whole deep-fried red snapper is yet another intriguing offering.",0,0
358,I Trulli,Italian,3,"Warm, ambient, and widely appealing, this precious restaurant is known for crafting Italian food with a light touch. Neither young nor hip, it's a neighborhood stalwart that still lures locals with its sublime covered garden, fantastic (and affordable) wine list, and charming dining room of white walls and flickering candles. Their enoteca next door is perfect for a glass of vino with friends. Then there's the menu, which is unabashedly pleasing, beginning with the panelle, chickpea fritters with goat cheese and a Sicilian-style caponata. House ""musts"" include panzerotti or mini-Apulian crispy calzones with tomato and mozzarella. Stuffed pastas are a huge draw-think of ravioli per Olivia oozing with ricotta and tossed in a light pistachio sauce.",0,0
359,Tía Pol,Spanish,1,"Tapas may have taken over Chelsea's storefronts, but stepping into this small plates paradise, you'll do a double take and wonder if this is Barcelona. The dimly lit, narrow room packs in wine-guzzling guests awaiting just a few tables. Busy servers uncork bottles and stream in and out of the open kitchen with Spanish classics like hand-shaved jamón and piquillo peppers. It's entertainment for the waiting game, which is always part of the experience at this ten-year-old staple.First bites say everything, and the fluffy wedge of tortilla, with its dab of garlicky aïoli, sets the standard for here and beyond. Don't miss the skirt steak, the most flavorful meat on the menu and a frequent special, served with potatoes and pickled red onions.",0,0
360,Pippali,Indian,2,"Named for the Ayurvedic healing herb, Pippali is a vibrant rookie in Curry Hill. On-point service makes it a dream destination for date night or dinner with friends. And, a natural color palette provides a striking backdrop for the kitchen's rout of delicious, brightly seasoned dishes. Indian standards are done right here, but focus on regional fare for a distinct perspective: kekada thokku is a mound of crabmeat dressed in a spicy blend of mustard seeds and cumin; and tawa scallops sautéed in tomato relish are enhanced with curried avocado chutney. Presentations are clean, careful and unfussy as seen in Bihari gosht or braised lamb shanks; while Konkan shrimp curry, augmented with coconut and coriander, makes for an aromatic and deeply flavorful feast.",0,0
361,Nightingale 9,Vietnamese,2,"Smith Street's fresh take on Vietnamese cuisine is the brainchild of Chef Robert Newton. Nightingale 9's home is the old Seersucker space, and the larger digs better accommodate the stream of neighborhood families out for something different. Its curious name refers to the old Brooklyn telephone exchange. Meanwhile, the ingredient-driven menu offers a subtle take on shredded green papaya salad that is accented by nuggets of house-dried beef, mint, and crispy shallots. Grilled beef meatballs are wonderfully chewy, flavorful, and fun in your mouth. They are in turn accompanied by sheets of rice paper and water; diners moisten these sheets until they become soft, pliable, and ready to roll with meat and herbs, before being dunked in spicy nuoc cham.",0,0
362,Bhatti,Indian,1,"This Northern Indian eatery is praised for its array of tasty grilled meats and kebabs that emerge from the bhatti (open-fire grill). Quality ingredients and a skilled kitchen combine with delicious results as in haryali choza, nuggets of white meat chicken marinated in an herbaceous blend of mint, cilantro, green fenugreek, chilies, and hung curd; or the unique house specialty gilauti kebab, made from fragrantly spiced lamb ground so fine and incredibly tender that it's almost pâté-smooth. Hearty dishes such as khatte baigan, silky chunks of eggplant stewed in a tangy onion-tomato masala and garnished with pickled ginger root, wrap up temptations. The room is kitsch-free and tastefully done with dark wood furnishings set against red-and-gold wallpaper.",0,0
363,Haldi,Indian,2,"It takes serious effort for an Indian restaurant to stand out from the crowd in jam-packed Curry Hill, but by highlighting the cuisine of Calcutta and its faction of Jewish immigrants, this arrival does just that. Haldi translates to turmeric in Hindi, and the space is rightfully decorated by the liberal use of yellow throughout. Executive Chef Hemant Mathur heads up this operation along with the other members in restaurateur Shiva Natarajan's empire. Discover unique tastes like mangshor chop, a crunchy ground lamb-and-potato patty served with cilantro chutney; fish-fry Calcutta-style served with mustard-and-onion relish; or chicken makmura featuring minced chicken meatballs cooked in a rich creamy curry made from almonds and cashews.",0,0
364,Co.,Pizza,2,"Head to Co. for something other than those Naples-aping pizzerias that have come to monopolize the whole of New York. A serious destination for its dedicated take on pies, this carb haven pays equal attention to the dough and toppings, with outstanding results. These are the ways of celebrated baker and chef, Jim Lahey, who perfected his yeasty, smoky flavors at Sullivan Street Bakery (a few doors away) and is NYC's resident expert on bread-making.Amid wood-paneled walls, wine racks, and modern-looking mirrors, crowds savor innovative combinations, such as spicy merguez with smoked pepper sauce, pecorino, and mint on a puffy crust. Nightly specials include a creamy leek and celeriac soup, finished with olive oil and freshly ground black pepper.",0,0
365,Kokum,Indian,2,"The specialties of India's southern coastline are the focus at this gratifying Shiva Natarajan venue. Named after the tart tropical fruit, Kokum is prettified by a mural of fishing boats on a sandy stretch and exposed filament bulbs reflecting warmly off bronzed mirror panels. Delights from Kerala, Chennai, and Mangalore anchor the menu. Roasted in a banana leaf with diced tomato and spices, the fish pollichathu is infused with sweetness and accompanied by fried tapioca root. Kori gassi is chicken in a rich curry containing plenty of dried red chilies but tempered by coconut milk and flecked with curry leaf. Carb fans can't resist the fragrant mound of vegetable biryani, drizzled with saffron butter, topped with fried onions and crushed papadum.",0,0
366,Tamba,Indian,2,"Tamba's food may be very good, but the genuine hospitality delivered by owner Mr. Malik and his team of servers is memorable. These are the touches that set it well above its Curry Hill brethren. Billed as an Indian grill, many dishes are char-kissed and arrive fresh from the tandoor like succulent jalpari (jumbo shrimp); mint paneer tikka; or haryali kebab, skewered chunks of white meat chicken marinated in an herbaceous coriander-mint purée served over a bed of salad greens and browned onions.

369,Salt + Charcoal,Japanese,2,"The attention-grabbing, mouthwatering name says it all: this place is all about robata items, cooked over Japanese charcoal and dressed with a selection of salts. Inside the tiny corner space, minimal seating is amplified by a counter accented with black-glazed brick and mid-century modern chairs. And, highly-coveted sidewalk tables serve as a front row for Bedford Avenue's hipster parade. Skewers and small plates of charred nibbles include sweet miso-glazed goma fu, fish collar of the day, or strips of boneless Kurobuta pork short rib. Even the flame-free items are enticing, including soba, hako sushi, house-made chilled tofu accompanied by a trio of salts, as well as a refreshing salad comprised of four different varieties of seaweed.",0,0
370,NoMad,Contemporary,4,"The reputation of the seductively louche NoMad hotel, housed within a strikingly bohemian beaux-arts building, owes much to the considerable talents of Will Guidara and Chef Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park, as they look after all things relating to food and drink. The glass-roofed Atrium is the chief pleasure dome but a meal in NoMad's land is a moveable feast and some prefer eating in the more languid surroundings of the Parlour, where there's a little less head swiveling and competitive dressing. Wherever you sit, you'll find the service confident and engaging and the menu hugely appealing. Don't come expecting the culinary pyrotechnics of Eleven Madison Park: here it's about familiar flavors in more approachable, less intricate dishes, but with the same care and understanding of ingredients. Chicken-which, if we're honest, would be the final meal of choice of many of us-is the undoubted star; they roast a whole bird, pimp it up with foie gras and black truffle and serve it for two. Bone marrow adds depth to beef, while asparagus with bread sauce shows the kitchen is equally adept when subtlety is required. For dessert, look no further than the aptly named ""Milk & Honey.""",1,1
371,Copper Chimney,Indian,2,"Copper Chimney is a pleasing and tasteful retreat from Curry Hill's sassier options. Polite service and a dining room of pale gray walls and buff-colored banquettes soothe the spirit. But, one peek at the expansive menu is sure to entice your palate. The regional offerings bring extensive choice, with myriad vegetarian and tandoori specialties. Mild but flavorful curries like dalchi machi feature salmon in a pale orange sauce that is thick as dal and seasoned with mustard seeds, curry leaves, and whole dried red chilies. Baingan bartha is a sumptuous blend of roasted and mashed eggplant cooked with onions, tomatoes, and spices. Breads served hot off the tawa are a must, like the aloo paratha which is pillowy soft and stuffed with spiced potatoes.",0,0
372,Anjappar,Indian,2,"Step inside this Curry Hill standout to unearth a dining room that is festive without being kitschy. Carved woodwork and a palette of red and ivory embolden the tasteful setting. Specializing in the cuisine of the Chettinad region, this South Indian kitchen showcases freshly ground spice blends and a particular fondness for eggs. This is clear in items like nattukozi (country chicken) biryani featuring a fluffy mound of fragrant basmati studded with a hard-boiled egg and pieces of bone-in chicken, sided by onion gravy, chopped fresh onion, and tomato-studded raita.

A wide selection of Turkish wines makes a fine accompaniment to a hearty meal.

And about those plates: O Ya's seemingly endless array of service pieces are beautiful, almost to the point of distraction. Seafood, treated with an itamae's reverence and modern day ingenuity, is the foundation of a strictly set-menu experience. Tables are a comfortable seating option, but the best place to be is at the counter. From there, a view of what's about to be set before you builds much anticipation: torched hamachi is crowned by banana pepper purée; lightly grilled lobster sits atop shiso tempura; and a turkey egg-chive omelet is sprinkled with powdered Wagyu beef schmaltz.",0,0
375,Momokawa,Japanese,2,"By offering the comforting tastes of authentic Japanese cooking (the kind that people yearn for on a daily basis), Momokawa reminds us that sushi is for special occasions. Favored by expats and area residents, it's the type of place Tokyo salarymen might frequent before the long commute home. Ascend the winding staircase to discover a tidy room with counter seats and booths that can become private thanks to ceiling-mounted bamboo shades. The range of tasty plates reveal goma-tofu, a dimpled round of sesame tofu topped with a bit of uni and freshly grated wasabi; as well as satsuma-age, tasty pan-fried fish cakes. Other satisfying courses include ochazuke-mentai, rice topped with spicy cod roe and nori, over which guests pour a savory green tea broth.",0,0
376,The Red Cat,American,2,"If crowds indicate quality (and downtown they often do) then this clear favorite is still going strong after more than 15 years. Loyal customers as diverse as the city itself flood the long bar and richly colored room for lunch, dinner, or just for a finely mixed cocktail and snack. Flowers give the space a touch of luxury; Moorish lanterns add warmth.The pleasures here are straightforward, beginning with a smoky bowl of charred eggplant dip, with a healthy splash of sherry vinegar, garlic, and herbs, served with fresh bread. Don't miss schmaltz-fried eggs on top of crispy potato rosti, piled with buttery sautéed spinach and tender brisket. Crunchy cinnamon churros with a spiced chocolate ganache and guava-caramel sauce are a decadent finish.",0,0
377,Les Halles,French,2,"Named for the famed Parisian marketplace, this Les Halles is better known locally for birthing New York's enfant terrible, Tony Bourdain. The writer and chef-turned-TV personality may be globe-trotting, but his legend remains part of the fabric here. Gaze up those worn wooden columns to sense this brasserie's storied history and age. Tightly knit tables generate competing conversations; checkered terrazzo floors and hardwood do little to buffer the hums. Expect many ooh-la-las over very tasty gratinée des Halles, a French onion soup with melted cheese capping croutons soaked in a rich beef broth. Waiters are courteous yet quick in delivering timeless dishes like steak au poivre crusted with black peppercorns and coupled with deliciously crisp frites.",0,0
378,Trestle on Tenth,Austrian,2,"West Chelsea's non-stop canteen is favored by a steady stream of gallerists, fashionistas, and tourists out for a jaunt along the High Line. Despite the glitz of this ascendant neighborhood, the look here is cozy, sociable, and downright humble.Pastas may veer from the Austrian theme but are nonetheless delicious. Try the tagliatelle tossed in a buttery broth of clams, parsley, and garlic. Calf's liver here is outrageously funky and just as delicious, tender and supremely fresh beneath carmelized onions and a sweet wine reduction. The Nusstorte is a symphony of cruncy walnuts, sticky caramel, and Madagascan vanilla ice cream. Wash it all down with a Swiss wine or craft beer.Rocket Pig is the restaurant's highly popular offshoot next door.",0,0
379,Baci & Abbracci,Italian,2,"This upbeat Williamsburg eatery features Italian cuisine with a wholehearted emphasis on pizza. With more than twenty permutations of pies baked in their wood-burning oven from Naples, these smoky-chewy crusts may be the foundation for sauce and freshly made mozzarella, or even focaccia tartufata-two thin layers filled with robiola cheese and topped with truffle oil. Beyond this, the adept kitchen also boasts homemade bread, enjoyable pastas, and an impressive short list of secondi like juicy lamb chops with a crisp potato-rosemary crust. The intimate space sports a contemporary design framed by a concrete floor, sleek furnishings, and glazed-tile accents. A charming little patch of backyard makes an especially popular setting for weekend brunch.",0,0
380,Samurai Mama,Japanese,1,"For an authentic taste of Japan in Williamsburg, Chef Makoto Suzuki's cozy den is the place to be. Save for a handful of seats and high-backed wooden booths, a communal table touched by seasonal flora hosts the majority of its occupants. Raw offerings include taco-style sushi, the fish cradled by a sheet of toasted nori, but the menu's crux is on cooked bites-think handmade pork gyoza, kabocha squash simmered in dashi, and nicely done tempura. A truly special treat here is the udon, a tangle of plump, chewy house-made noodles crafted from California-milled flour and filtered water bobbing in luscious broths. Try the seafood curry variation-a rich, bonito and curry powder-spiked broth stocked with sweet shrimp, mussels, and scallops.",0,0
381,Marta,Italian,2,"Channeling the success of boutique hotel-style Italian dining, Danny Meyer and his team apply a similar mindset to this latest venture located at the Martha Washington hotel. A former woman's lodging, the space was recently given a dramatic makeover to accommodate the lobby level restaurant-a sharp-looking open layout complete with a dining counter overlooking wood-fired pizza ovens. Like Maialino, Marta is helmed by Chef Nick Anderer and boasts a Roman accent. But, that's where the similarities end. Crispy, thin-crust pizza is the main attraction on this pasta-free menu: the margherita, for instance, is a crackling delight from the pizze rosse listing, while the anatra combining duck confit, fennel, and golden raisins is a novel pizze bianche.",0,0
382,The Breslin,Gastropub,3,"Not sure you've come to the right place? Just look for those new media hotties climbing out of black cars, and know that you've arrived at The Breslin. Attached to the markedly hip Ace Hotel, this uber-stylish gastropub, known for its pretty patrons and perpetual buzz, is a place to see and be seen. Booths tucked into nooks on one side of the room are by far the best seats in the house, but all is not lost if you can't nab one. Close-knit tables adorned with white china and rustic wooden boards are equally inviting, with views of the open kitchen. If your welcome was a bit...well lukewarm...you'll find that the tee- and tattoo-donning staff warms up as service progresses-not unlike one's appreciation for the chef's outstanding creations. Parmesan and fried parsley leaves gild the romaine in a delicious, very garlicky Caesar salad; just as a coiled link of terrifically flavored merguez is perfectly finished with smoky Marcona almond aïoli. Meanwhile, warm and milky burrata gains great flavor and texture when kissed by nutty hazelnut pesto. Clementine cake frosted with mascarpone and dates is a sweet example of how this kitchen elevates seemingly simple eats to thoroughly stellar treats.",1,1
383,The John Dory Oyster Bar,Seafood,2,"Brought to you by Chef April Bloomfield and company, this oyster bar occupies a blue-chip, corner spot in the untouchably cool Ace Hotel. The style is vintage with aquatic accents: floor-to-ceiling windows flood the space with light, while black-tiled columns, copper tables, and crayon-bright green and blue bar stools complete the look. The unpretentious and modern menu showcases impeccable seafood. An assortment from the raw bar may feature whelks with parsley and garlic butter; east- and west-coast oysters shucked before your very eyes; and top quality shellfish with a lemon-and-shallot sauce. On the menu, find semolina soup with Nantucket bay scallops, or Spanish mackerel with crunchy cilantro-squid crackers. Sadly, service can be indifferent.",0,0
384,Zenkichi,Japanese,2,"This exceptional Japanese brasserie bears an utterly unique setting. Pay attention, or you'll miss the entry-the wood-armored façade is a sly indication of its existence. Step inside and receive warm greetings all around, followed by an escorted journey to your private dining booth on one of the floors above. Each booth is sequestered by cooling bamboo shades, while dark wood and minimal lighting further elevate the sense of intimacy. When you need assistance, ring the tabletop buzzer. Zenkichi's omakase is a big draw, but items may also be ordered à la carte. These may highlight house-made tofu drizzled with chilled dashi; maguro carpaccio arranged over shredded carrots and dressed with a ginger sauce; or grilled jidori chicken with yuzu kosho.",0,0
385,Chop-Shop,Asian,2,"Now an über-hip scene, this far west strip of Chelsea has been attracting its fair share of affluent locals and a flurry of dashing eateries; Chop-Shop is part of that evolution. Outfitted in reclaimed pine, vintage lights, and concrete floors, it has an industrial look but is awash with sunlight thanks to soaring windows. The eclectic menu roams across Asia with deliciously balanced and infinitely varied plates. Subtlety reigns in an avocado-tofu summer roll paired with peanut curry sauce or salt-and-pepper shrimp, while Chinese water spinach with fermented tofu cream delivers an intense punch of flavor. Fried rice with salmon and peas is less than classic but more than popular. Rich tastes and silky textures meld beautifully in coconut crème caramel.",0,0
386,Resto,Contemporary,2,"Vibrant cooking, a winning ambience, and an inviting marble bar have made this brasserie a perpetual neighborhood favorite. Despite numerous kitchen shakeups, the talented team behind the line always lands on its feet and continues to turn out a roster of worthwhile temptations. Moules frites are a hold-over from when Belgian cooking dominated the menu, but contemporary plates have included charred squid salad with citrus segments and shaved sunchokes; cavatelli with creamy fontina cheese, shaved Brussels sprouts, and toasted pine nuts; and pork shoulder steak with fava bean gribiche. For an array of meaty treats washed down by global brews, head next door to sister spot The Cannibal, which has a second, thriving outpost in midtown's Gotham Market West.",0,0
387,Lupulo,Portuguese,2,"Located at the base of Eventi, a Kimpton Hotel, Chef George Mendes' elegant restaurant is a beautiful, industrial-chic ode to the casual home cooking of Portugal. Food voyeurs should vie for a seat at the bar, where they can eye fresh seafood lined up in plump, shimmering rows or enjoy the action behind the glass wall of the semi-open kitchen. Otherwise, a seat in the bustling dining room, decked out in gorgeous Portuguese tiles and hip lobster-trap lights, ought to do the trick.Try the espargos assados, a dish of tender, spit-grilled spring asparagus topped with shaved dried sea urchin, sorrel, olive oil and a dust of sea salt; or the wickedly good frango piri-piri, grilled to perfection and served with its mouthwatering namesake pepper sauce.",0,0
388,The Runner,American,2,"Part cocktail bar, part farm-to-table restaurant, The Runner has that low-lit industrial cool look that draws in passersby both day and night. With a rustic aesthetic and modern touches, it's a lovely spot to cozy up with a craft beer at the bar, where the bartender is on a first-name basis with regulars. The menu prizes top ingredients that skew local, as in the tender L.I. fluke with succulent mussels marinière, made even heftier with a creamy, garlic-buttery broth of white wine, parsley, and shallots. Don't even try to share that dish; instead, greedily sop it all up with an order of hot and gently crisped ""tongue bread."" Finish with pistachio frangipane tart, blending sweet and nutty flavors in a dense crust and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.",0,0
389,Colonia Verde,Latin American,2,"The historic blocks with row homes on Fort Greene's DeKalb Ave. make for an equally appealing restaurant row. Thanks to a sunken front room that flanks the open kitchen's wood-fired oven, plus a glassed-in ""greenhouse"" that transitions to a pebbled outdoor garden, locals stroll into Colonia Verde no matter the time of year. And why not? The banter is lively and meals rewarding. Its menu is a Brazilian-esque expression of the owners of Cómodo in SoHo. Curiously named dishes like poblano pepper fettuccine stars pasta tossed with a spicy, satisfying ragù made from roasted poblanos, pecans, and ground beef. For dessert, the Brooklyn Mess sweetens the deal: three scoops of coffee ice cream topped with mango, dulce de leche syrup, and toasted manioc flour.",0,0
390,Frankies 457 Spuntino,Italian,2,"Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli (collectively known as the Franks) have built a small empire for themselves based on delicious, seasonal Italian fare served in rustic little haunts. Frankies 457 Spuntino, a charming, brick-lined space with bare wood tables and a quiet, shady backyard strung with twinkling bistro lights, is a classic example of their easy Brooklyn style. Seem familiar by now? Well, these guys wrote the book. Service is laid-back and unpretentious, perhaps because they know the food does the talking here: a wildly fresh fennel, celery root, and parsley salad arrives with aged pecorino and a delicate lemon vinaigrette; while a tender tangle of linguini is laced with a fresh tomato broth studded with fava beans and garlic.",0,0
391,The General Greene,American,2,"Despite the fact that this sounds like Grandpa's pet-name for his antique tractor, The General Greene is a space that nicely straddles rusticity and hipness while serving three satisfying meals a day. Everything seems cool here, if perhaps a bit aloof, from the perfectly ambient lighting, comfy banquettes, and leather bar stools to that highly prized espresso machine and free WiFi for your iPad. The menu has a playful Southern slant, as seen in a warm haricot vert salad tossed with dates, almonds, and orange segments with a chive-buttermilk biscuit; or mac and cheese melting Vermont cheddar, Gruyère, and parmesan folded with cavatelli. Ham-and-Gruyère bread pudding is custard-like and brutally addictive. Homemade cookies seem to fly out the door.",0,0
392,Tabaré,Latin American,2,"Spanish tuna and black olive empanadas, homemade pastas, and the market-driven likes of a summery chilled soup made of Cubanelle peppers all deliciously co-exist at the charming Tabaré, where the cuisine of Uruguay headlines the delightful roster. Attractively rustic, the compact dining room is lined by slats of unpolished wood, and provides seating along a colorful fabric-covered banquette. The bar-like the back patio-is an inviting roost. Tabaré's cooking uses local product and represents the Italian-Spanish influences that color the kitchen's creations. This includes malfatti, luscious ricotta dumplings adorned with squash blossoms wilted under a drizzle of hot butter and white truffle oil; or grass-fed skirt steak sided by savory chimichurri.",0,0
393,Prime Meats,European,2,"Prime Meats stands tall and proud as a true original and local gem for German eats set to American beats. The booths in front are bright and snug, while bentwood chairs and net curtains tied into a knot add to that brasserie feel. A warm vibe and cheery servers complete the picture. Hand-crafted sausages and burgers are all the rage here. Nibble away on homemade pretzels while perusing the lunch menu, which may be simple and sandwich-focused, but always showcases a gutsy edge. Bold flavors shine through in a creamy roasted squash soup; jagerwurst, a lightly charred, delicately smoky, and meaty sausage with red cabbage casserole; or Jen's German potato salad tossing waxy potato slices, chopped herbs, and thick bacon lardons in a pickled dressing.",0,0
394,Ramen Yebisu,Japanese,1,"At this popular Williamsburg ramen-ya, Chef and Hokkaido native Akira Hiratsuka ladles signature bowlfuls of Sapporo-style ramen, characterized by its seafood-infused broth and wavy noodles aged for 48-hours. The results are distinct and delicious. Among the host of options to be tried are shoyu (soy-based), shio (salt-based), or the special house ramen brimming with a bounty of shellfish. A recent unique offering featured a fiery broth infused with a blend of 12 spices and fish sauce and filled with bone-in pork rib, cabbage, and red chilies. Slurp your soup at one of two seating options in the moody, dark-walled space: perched atop tall tables or at a counter looking into the kitchen, where a refrigerator unit is stocked with custom-made noodles.",0,0
395,Delaware and Hudson,American,3,"This small Williamsburg gem arrives courtesy of Chef/owner Patti Jackson, who marries her Northeastern Pennsylvania upbringing (sourcing her ingredients from the wonderful farms that dot the Mid-Atlantic) with her lengthy culinary resume (I Trulli, for starters). The results are, as you'd expect, delightful. In summer months, there's a small outdoor patio with a handful of seats overlooking the sidewalk. Inside the restaurant, you'll find a long, narrow dining space with exposed wood beams; bare wooden tables; and photographs on the walls depicting farm life. The overall effect is one of rustic, folksy ease-with a genuinely warm and knowledgeable service staff adding to the appeal. Diners are offered a rotating, four-course dinner at an excellent value, where a collection of seasonal, farm-fresh small plates kick off the meal, followed by a pasta course, choice of entrée, and, finally, the day's dessert. Each dish is more delicious than the last: a mouthwatering plate of hand-rolled macaroni alla pettine arrives with tender grilled zucchini, salty farmer's cheese, and mint; while a flaky fillet of Long Island fluke is paired with smooth polenta, ripe Sun Gold tomatoes, and a cascade of chopped eggplant.",1,1
396,Traif,Contemporary,2,"Small plates smacked with flavor are the dishes du jour at this rollicking eatery. The moniker translates to ""forbidden"" in Yiddish, and the renegade menu displays an affinity for pork and shellfish. From the open kitchen, Chef Jason Marcus and his team send a steady stream of solid creations like cornmeal-dusted fried green tomatoes with Old Bay aïoli and Tabasco sauce. Head-on prawns, pan-roasted in foie gras fat with wild mushrooms and spring onion, are served on a slice of toast thick enough to absorb all the savory drippings. For dessert, try the butterscotch budino layered with rosemary ice cream and chopped hazelnuts. The narrow space is muted with pale grey walls but enhanced by a mural of cartoon colors and an especially pleasant back patio.",0,0
397,Fort Defiance,American,2,"Surprisingly mellow for a restaurant named after a Revolutionary War fort, this Southern tavern (of sorts) is a warm and inviting space where one meal can easily bleed into the next. With a reputation for cocktails, a classic wood bar, and tables covered in colorful oilcloths depicting flora and fauna, this is a lively but not-too-crowded watering hole with solid cooking and heaps of character. A meal could start with crostini topped with local ricotta, shiitake mushrooms, kale, and parmesan. On a blustery day in windswept Red Hook, perhaps the smoky lentil soup will do. Locals return time and again for classics like faultless deviled eggs dusted with paprika. A lean towards the South is seen in the hearty muffuletta of New Orleans fame.",0,0
398,Egg,American,1,"It was only a matter of time before owner George Weld would have to find larger digs for his home of the city's best biscuits. Egg's ravenous following is now accommodated in a much larger location that's light and bright with seating at a number of counters and ample table space; yet it's still common to be faced with a queue. Breakfast is served all day, every day, and stars those fantastic buttermilk biscuits. The fresh-baked beauties are split open and smothered with pork sausage-studded sawmill gravy, stacked with country ham, house-made fig jam, and Vermont cheddar cheese; or simply accompanied by molasses, honey, or jelly. Lunchtime brings savory fare like Carolina kale wilted in a spicy tomato broth poured over a wedge of crumbly cornbread.",0,0
399,Roman's,Italian,2,"Candlelight bounces off white-tiled walls and a colorful mosaic throughout this cozy hideaway's small, tasteful dining room. Locals return for the two daily cocktails (one bitter, one sour) along with the short, none-too-complicated menu that is a study in the strength of focus. This is the type of inviting neighborhood joint that calls for a glass of wine and soulful pasta at the bar. Dishes are straightforward but satisfy in their careful execution. A squid salad with cannellini beans, tomato, herbs, and fantastic olive oil is elevated by seasoning and texture from toasted breadcrumbs. Tortelli stuffed with fluffy ricotta find a succulent home in pork ragù. A wonderfully rich and almost chocolate-hued braised beef rib tops buttery whipped potatoes.",0,0
400,Prospect,American,2,"This Fort Greene standout offers delicious cooking and just so happens to be pretty cool, too. Barrel-aged negronis are among the offerings from a white marble bar that provides much needed real estate. Walls are lined with reclaimed planks of the Coney Island boardwalk, and genuinely hospitable service tames the perpetually packed house. Quality trumps quantity in the streamlined selection of product-driven creations. Silken strands of house-made fettucine twirled with lemon beurre blanc and finely grated parmesan make an enticing starter, while pan-seared skate garnished tableside with coconut milk broth redolent of lemongrass and Persian lime is an inspired entrée. Finish off with a tres leches cake topped with salted sugar cookie crumbs.",0,0
401,Xixa,Mexican,2,"Flaunting the trademark style of Chef Jason Marcus, this Mexican romp packs Williamsburg denizens into a slender space set aglow by etched brass ceiling pendants. A delicious alchemy is at work here, as evidenced in the crabmeat-topped tamale flan sauced with fava bean-poblano purée; baked lamb meatballs in chipotle cream accompanied by grilled garlic and cheese sprinkled Texas toast; or strawberry tres leches with fragrant cilantro ice cream. Like the menu, the beverage listing is loads of fun. Wines are whimsically arranged under headings of iconic women (Rieslings listed in the Helen Mirren section are described as concentrated and transcendent), and deconstructed margaritas feature a shot of tequila poured over frozen cubes of fruit juices.",0,0
402,Juni,Contemporary,4,"Australian exports don't just include beef and precious metals-these days its chefs also seem highly prized by various countries around the world. Being largely unhindered by an allegiance to a particular culinary tradition seemingly allows them to freely embrace innovation and creativity, and they all arrive with a healthy international outlook. Cairns-born Shaun Hergatt's cooking is certainly original. Whether you're having the squab with salsify or the ""rabbit and the carrot,"" you'll know you're in the hands of a kitchen with a mastery of modern cooking techniques. His dishes are all artfully presented creations and the combinations of superlative ingredients and well-defined flavors display far greater depth than the somewhat terse three-word menu descriptions would suggest. The dining room, within the Hotel Chandler, is a touch anodyne and tables are ridiculously far apart, but the atmosphere remains far from solemn thanks, in no small part, to the personality and genuine care shown by the well-informed and helpful service team.",1,1
403,No. 7,American,2,"This is the type of place where you sit down, look at the menu, and say, ""Does that really work?"" And it does-most of the time-as far as No. 7 is concerned. With its worn-in good looks, casual vibe, and horseshoe-shaped banquettes, this perpetually packed spot screams group dinners. Feast your eyes on the open kitchen, where the talented team crafts obsession-worthy dishes like the double-decker broccoli tacos. The exemplary combination of flavors and textures is simply brilliant: both a soft and a crisp taco shell (with just the right grease-tinged crunch) hold a mixture of cooked broccoli, salty feta, creamy beans, and fried shallots. To balance the earthy flavors, sink into the salted chocolate and corn puff tart, served with peanut butter ice cream.",0,0
404,Buttermilk Channel,American,2,"Doug Crowell and Chef Ryan Angulo run the sort of joint we'd all like to have at the end of our street. It's warm and relaxed, run with care and attention, offers an appealing menu for all occasions-and has prices that encourage regular attendance. The name may refer to the tidal strait but also evokes feelings of comfort and cheer in a place that's already cute and where the close-set tables and large bar both add to the animated atmosphere. The kitchen seeks out worthy suppliers and with no little skill imbues each dish with that little extra something, be it the cod with Littleneck clams, the fresh linguini with beets or indeed the buttermilk-fried chicken. This care is even evident at weekend brunches on standouts like short rib hash.",0,0
405,Rye,American,2,"Rye's Classic Old Fashioned-a carefully crafted swirl of liquid amber-is the perfect personification of Chef Cal Elliott's beloved gastropub: strong, satisfying, and comforting. Anchored by a reclaimed mahogany bar, the Brooklyn speakeasy is accented accordingly with creaky plank flooring, a pressed-tin ceiling, and exposed filament bulbs overhead. For even more reasons to imbibe, climb down to the basement offshoot, The Bar Below Rye. Bar snacks such as oysters, cheeses, and duck rillettes with pickled watermelon lead to a succinct lineup of cooking that includes crispy skin seared Scottish salmon dressed with seasonal vegetables and preserved lemon. For dessert, the warm and fudgy molten chocolate cake is another classic Rye gets just right.",0,0
406,The Good Fork,Contemporary,2,"The Good Fork is a destination restaurant, and foodies know that it's well worth the journey. Located on the food-centric Van Brunt Street near the Red Hook Waterfront, this inviting spot swaps New York pretense for pure passion-it's the dream of a married couple who built the restaurant from scratch, literally. Co-owner Ben Schneider crafted the space, while his classically trained wife, Chef Sohui Kim, helms the kitchen. Her cuisine reflects the team's commitment to the locality, as seen in such original dishes as pan-seared cod reclining on squid rings braised in a spicy kimchi broth; or hot and crisp manchego arancini cooled with yogurt and a fennel-tomato marmalade. A tres leches cake with fresh berry compote is a crowning way to close this meal.",0,0
407,Semilla,Contemporary,3,"Vegetables bask in the spotlight at this stellar South Williamsburg counter, where the formidable team of Chefs José Ramírez-Ruiz and Pamela Yung apply their fine dining aptitude to produce an improvisational feast out of the season's bounty. Turning the notion of service on its head, members of the kitchen step away from their stations to deliver their intricate compositions-each of them plated on hand thrown pottery. The briefest of descriptions is offered upon presentation, which means that a mouthful of ""grilled squash,"" for example, might also deliver raw slivers of pattypan, creamy peanut sauce, and a dusting of dried mint. Embellishments like foie gras and trout roe are used sparingly and to splendid effect, never outshining the true flavor of the produce. Semilla's bread is house-made, excellent, and used to accentuate the menu; as seen in a wedge of flax seed-barley sourdough with cultured butter to accompany a roasted carrot ""mille-feuille,"" alongside smoked potato purée and fava-greens sauce. Although the duo of sweets to finish may include options that disappoint, dessert can also be an electrifying success as in the egg yolk-saffron sorbet, cloud of smoked cream, and passion fruit.",1,1
408,M Shanghai,Chinese,1,"Look at the steamer full of luscious soup dumplings on just about every table in this notable Williamsburg Chinese café, and there should be little doubt of the best way to begin a meal here. Plump full of hot pork broth magically encased in scalloped wonton wrappers, they are sheer pleasure. Vegan and vegetarian treats include fried tofu with sweet peppers and black bean sauce; or cool, silken batons of eggplant salad dressed with plenty of garlic, soy, and a hint of sweetness. The scallion pancakes are fantastically large, hot, and shatteringly crisp wedges accompanied by a dipping sauce prepared tableside. The low-key room is accented by whitewashed brick walls, honey-toned bamboo slats, and ceiling lights fashioned out of birdcages.",0,0
409,HanGawi,Korean,2,"Beyond an ordinary façade lies this serene, shoes-off retreat with traditional low tables, Korean artifacts, and meditative music. Said footwear is stored in cubbies, seating is the color of bamboo, and clay teapots adorn the back wall. The setting is soothing, but the atmosphere is surprisingly convivial, with groups gabbing over stuffed shiitake mushrooms and green tea. The ssam bap offers a fun DIY experience with a long platter of fillings. Dark leafy lettuce and thin, herbaceous sesame leaves are topped with creamy slices of avocado, crunchy bean sprouts, pickled daikon, carrot, cucumber, radish, and three rice options-white, brown, and a nutty, purple-tinged multigrain. Topped with miso ssam sauce, each bite is a fresh burst of uplifting textures.",0,0
410,Kirakuya,Japanese,2,"Located on the second floor of a nondescript building, this authentic izakaya buried in K-town feels exotic and unexpected. Out the elevator and beyond the dim (even dingy) hallway, your welcome will be warm and energetic. The long room is clad in dark brown wood, but bright with large windows and very good service. Take it as an auspicious sign that Japanese is spoken at many of the tables. Midday is limited to the budget-friendly lunch set, as in a tasty shio saba meal of grilled mackerel with a salad, miso soup, and pickles. The wide-ranging evening menu includes overnight dried squid, Berkshire pork belly in a sweet soy sauce, tsukune (grilled chicken meatball), and a few Western-influenced snacks like French fries with rosemary salt.",0,0
411,Bozu,Japanese,1,"An enticing selection of Japanese tapas-with many pleasing vegetarian options-is buttressed by a gracious staff and laid-back vibe at this upbeat, hip, and tasty spot. The slim wood and brick space is dressed in grey and installed with an L-shaped counter, a row of tables, and back patio. Bring friends and order a lot. The sushi bar tempts with the yakko roll filled with silken house-made tofu and green onion; spicy mushroom roll dabbed with tomatillo purée; and gunkanzushi topped with sweet sea scallop and plump salmon roe alongside soy sauce pre-seasoned with wasabi. Cooked dishes bring on the likes of deep-fried gyoza filled with tomato, and fantastically intense nuggets of fried chicken thigh marinated for 48 hours in garlic and soy sauce.",0,0
412,Kang Suh,Korean,2,"A longtime favorite of Korean barbecue fans, this lively yet homey joint delivers an authentic and charming experience. Donning an old-school vibe, the room may seem trapped in time, but be assured as there is delish food and free-flowing soju on deck here. Bypass the first floor and find a roost on the second level, where warm, almost maternal servers with a sense of humor present an array of fragrant grilled meats. The haemool pa jeon is a flaky seafood pancake and excellent starter that may be trailed by delicate slices of galbi sizzling on the grill. Further indulge this meat feast with jaeyook gui or marinated pork grilled to pink perfection. Yet still be sure to save room for boodae chongol-a bubbling stew of kimchi, pork, vegetables, and noodles.",0,0
413,SoCo,Southern,2,"Southern food meets bohemian city life at SoCo, an urbane, industrial-chic restaurant where guests are greeted at the door with a splash of wonderful jazz. The gracious, hospitable staff manages to meander through the young professionals and artsy Pratt students with ease, and if the cool charm of SoCo doesn't woo you, the outstanding Southern fare will certainly do the trick: organic buttermilk-fried chicken arrives crispy and tender, and served over a delicious red velvet waffle; while fall-off-the-bone short ribs are braised in an irresistible coconut-molasses-ginger sauce, and served with creamy garlic mashed potatoes and tender okra. Then a soft peach cobbler is spiced to perfection. Brunch is especially popular, so arrive early.",0,0
414,Mandoo Bar,Korean,1,"Tasty, cheap, quick, and clean, Mandoo Bar knows exactly who it is and what it does well. A neon pink ""M"" lights up the front window, through which passersby can glimpse a sort of grandmotherly chef folding dumplings with myriad fillings. Each wrapper color indicates what is tucked within, with green for vegetable, white for pork, and pink for seafood. True to its name, these mandoo can be found on every table. Crisp fried pork goon mandoo are half-moon shaped and seared until brown and blistered, stuffed with minced pork seasoned with Chinese chives. Simple flavors are the hallmarks of their boiled vegetable dumplings-enticingly plump and chewy. The full kitchen also offers an array of larger dishes, like jap chae and bi bim bap.",0,0
415,Miss Korea,Korean,2,"If K-Town were a music arena, Miss Korea would be the headliner. Window-lined and perched above the crowded street level with an ambience that feels equally elevated, it has a unique personality that outshines the competition. Settle into the ground floor or head up a labyrinth of stairs to enter yet another pleasant dining room filled with tropical accents, tabletop grills, and cozy dining nooks. This lady is loved by many, so go with a group to really explore the menu and indulge in authentic japchae stir-fried with beef and veggies, or flaky seafood pancakes. Dolsot bibimbap highlights crusty rice spiced with kimchi and gochujang, while those pork mandoo are extra divine when dunked in light soy. Barbecue pork belly could be prize-winning.",0,0
416,Roebling Tea Room,Contemporary,2,"Cuisine that bristles with creativity keeps the foodie crowd coming to this rough-hewn Williamsburg café. A popular bar anchors the room's layout, which is rustically appointed with absinthe-green ceramic tiles, rusted window frames, and pale beige painted-over brick accented by vintage wallpaper. Lunch starts early and includes eye-opening options like the big pancake. Really, it's huge-baked in a cast iron skillet, laden with thinly sliced apples, and accompanied by warm maple syrup. Steak tartare with fried chickpeas and Kewpie mayonnaise satisfies savory cravings; and creamy grits- and egg yolk-stuffed ravioli, slicked with shrimp-infused ""flamingo butter"" sauce, is a specialty that successfully sums up the kitchen's distinct personality.",0,0
417,Don's Bogam,Korean,2,"At Don's Bogam, the food is fantastic and service indulgent. So, reserve ahead as every seat is filled-from the festive bar up front right down to those fun two-tops sporting blazing grills. Make no mistake-this is no average K-town joint. Inside, a top-notch venting system lets diners enjoy a smoke-free evening of exceptional grilled meats. Start wtih deep-fried pork mandu, which are crisp, on-point, and extra divine. Wonderfully flaky buchu gochu pajeon is studded with chives for perfect flavor; while pork belly marinated in red wine is smoky and supremely tender. For the ultimate payoff, opt for the memorable beef platter featuring thinly sliced macun and yangneuym galbi set beside king trumpet mushrooms-meaty and mouthwatering in their own right.",0,0
418,Miranda,Fusion,2,"The cuisines of Latin America and Italy join for a splendid union at this Williamsburg trattoria, run by husband-wife team Sasha and Mauricio Miranda. The pretty space is illuminated with jewel-toned votives and boasts a cement floor inlaid with oak, straw seat chairs, and exposed brick. Beyond this, the chef puts her impressive experience to work in the open kitchen. The house-made pappardelle is a perfect example of Miranda's unique approach: the wide delicate strands of pasta clutch on to bits of slow-cooked lamb in a dark, earthy, mole tasting of dried chilies, sweet spices, and bitter chocolate. Other items may include grilled baby octopus with avocado and jalapeño, or roasted pork tenderloin with tomato and cumin-scented Arborio rice.",0,0
419,New Wonjo,Korean,2,"Smack in the middle of Koreatown, New Wonjo offers a savory respite among the sensory overload of this jam-packed quarter. The simple, well-maintained space offers seating for small parties on the ground level, and a second floor reserved for barbecue-seeking groups to huddle around platters of marinated slices of beef brisket (chadol baeki) or spicy squid with pork belly (o-sam bul goki) sizzling on table top grills. Non-barbecue options feature tasty Korean favorites, with starters like mandoo, japche, and pajun. Sample satisfying stews like gamba tang-a bubbling red chili-spiked broth floating slowly simmered and very meaty pork bones with chunks of potato, cabbage, greens, and onions that is wonderfully flavorful but never incendiary.",0,0
420,Zizi Limona,Mediterranean,2,"A trio of skilled partners have come together at this low-key Williamsburg café to offer up some of the finest Mediterranean cooking around. A home-style spin on Israeli and Moroccan cooking reveals amazing hummus; plus treats like a warm grilled cauliflower and artichoke hearts salad dressed with strained yogurt and mouth-coatingly rich raw tahini. The menu possesses whimsy and a wink, as in kosher (not really?) octopus with garlic purée and a white bean salad. The basbousa-crumbles of semolina cake with floss halva, creamy cardamom sauce, and date syrup-provides a decadent finish. Hummus Kitchen, the adjacent take-out shop is stocked with fragrant staples of the Mediterranean kitchen to peruse while waiting for your order of chicken couscous.",0,0
421,Kunjip,Korean,1,"One of K-town's better recommendations, this ever-bustling restaurant is open 24-hours a day, seven days a week. Prepare yourself to be immersed in a noisy setting, wafting with food aromas, where orange-shirted servers whiz by, balancing trays heaped with plates of banchan, sizzling stone bowls of bibimbap, or empty dishes from instantly re-set tables. You may feel compelled to order right away as the line out the door makes for a less than leisurely ambience, but relax. The staff is pleasant and the vast menu is worth perusing. Find specialties like mae woon dduk boki-a saucy stew of pan-fried rice cake tossed with softened white onion, plenty of scallions, mung bean noodles, and fish cake all tossed with spicy, sweet, and rich gochujang.",0,0
422,Reynard,American,2,"Inside the Wythe hotel, find this fun and très Brooklyn-chic dining room, thanks to restaurateur Andrew Tarlow (of Diner and Marlow & Sons). The setting's former life as a century-old cooperage is proudly honored in myriad details like original masonry and cast iron columns. Parchment-colored walls and mosaic-tile floors enhance the throwback mien. Even in the cool light of day, over a bowl of strained house-made yogurt drizzled with golden honey and topped with granola, Reynard feels sexy. The kitchen-equipped with a wood-burning oven-produces intriguing creations such as warm olives or red kale tossed with smoked Caesar dressing to snack on while awaiting hake chowder. Hearty entrées include oyster stew or rabbit with whole grain mustard.",0,0
423,2nd Avenue Deli,Deli,1,"While the décor may be more deli-meets-deco and there's a tad less attitude, this food is every bit as good as it was on Second Avenue. Ignore the kvetching and know that this is a true Jewish deli filled with personality, and one of the best around by far. The menu remains as it should: kosher, meat-loving, and non-dairy with phenomenal pastrami, pillowy rye, tangy mustard, perfect potato pancakes, and fluffy matzoh balls in comforting broth. Have the best of both worlds with the soup and half-sandwich combination. Carve a nook during midday rush, when in pour the crowds. The deli also does takeout (popular with the midtown lunch bunch), and delivery (grandma's pancakes at your door). Giant platters go equally well to a bris or brunch.",0,0
424,El Almacen,Argentinian,2,"This Argentinian grill is a carnivore's delight with its menu of meaty entrées from the grill (de la parrilla) like the parrillada featuring hearty ribeye and chorizo with truffle fries; or the ""kitchen"" offerings (de la cocina) which might include malbec-braised short ribs with sweet potato purée and Brussels sprouts. These hearty creations are best followed by dulce de leche in one of its several guises. El Almacen, which means general store in Spanish, boasts a dark, rustic, and atmospheric setting replete with creaking wood furnishings, shelves of bric-a-brac, and cast iron skillets mounted on a brick wall. The bar is inviting, amply stocked with wine bottles, and set against a backdrop of creamy white tiles warmed by the candlelit room.",0,0
425,St. Anselm,American,2,"Look to this roughhewn yet charming café for a meal of grilled, meaty satisfaction. Loud and proud carnivores, this one's for you. The perpetually rollicking kitchen embraces grilling as its preferred method of cooking to turn out a commendable bill of fare. Razor clams, sardines, artichokes, or haloumi comprise the offering of sizzling ""smalls,"" while ""bigs"" are founded on cuts of hormone-free meats procured from small ranches, and have included a dinner plate-sized lamb blade steak-scorched, enjoyably fatty, and deliciously salted-topped with a coin of mint-gremolata butter. Other options can include a sweet tea-brined chicken; sides like decadent spinach gratin; or a Mason jar of chocolate pot de crème topped with fleur de sel and whipped cream.",0,0
426,Wolfgang's,Steakhouse,4,"Wolfgang's is no stranger to the bustling New York steakhouse scene. From the lunch hour business crowd to the lively, post-work bar scene, Wolfgang's jams in locals and tourists alike-each coming for the classic fare and precise Manhattans. The service can be gruff at times, but they have a good track record of squeezing you into a table or perch at the bar without a reservation. Once seated, the bone-in Porterhouse, cooked rare, is the only way to go. It arrives sizzling in its own liquid fat and topped with butter. Save space for a slice of bacon-a must-order appetizer-creamed spinach, and crispy German potatoes with yet more salt and fat (at this point, why not?). Just beware: while dishes are sized to share, they're priced like Maseratis.",0,0
427,Hometown Bar-B-Que,Barbecue,2,"Texas-style barbecue has come to Brooklyn, even if this 'cue begins in an 18-foot smoke pit located a few blocks away, thereby keeping its on-site kitchen free from wood smoke. Instead, it remains focused on creamy mac n' cheese, whiskey sour pickles, and mayo-mustardy potato salad. Meats arrive sweet and tender enough to have a caramel crunch, while smoky sausages snap and explode with juice and chili-spiced bite-each is sold by the plump quarter-pound link. Ribs are cooked until the moment before they fall off the bone; and desserts feature Steve's Key lime pie locally made in Red Hook. The warehouse-like space is clad in repurposed wood with communal picnic tables lending an intimate and friendly vibe. Water Taxi is the easiest way here from Manhattan.",0,0
428,Runner & Stone,Contemporary,2,"An innate sense of purpose pervades this ambitious Gowanus operation. The name refers to the two stones used to grind grain; the location is just blocks away from where the city's first tide-water grist mill once stood; and the dining room is backed by a fantastic bakery headed by an alum of Per Se. Inside, the theme continues with walls constructed out of flour sack-formed concrete blocks. For lunch, sandwiches on mouthwatering bread include grilled cheddar with roasted and pickled peppers on whole wheat pain au lait, or falafel-inspired broccoli fritters swaddled in a warm pita with shots of harissa and walnut-yogurt sauce. Impressive house-made pastas and the likes of roasted chicken with soft buckwheat dumplings are crowd-pleasers at dinnertime.",0,0
429,Shalom Japan,Fusion,2,"The curious moniker of this sweet spot refers to the backgrounds of its husband-and-wife team, Chefs Aaron Israel and Sawako Okochi. Each has an impressive resume, and together the result is a unique labor of love. Nightly specials are displayed via a wall-mounted blackboard with small plates progressing to a handful of entrées. Monkfish hot pot features ankimo-enriched miso broth, ground shrimp balls, glass noodles, and a heap of fragrant fresh herbs. The house-baked sake kasu challah with raisin butter is a highly recommended start. But, it may also turn up as toro toast smeared with scallion and wasabi cream cheese and topped with finely chopped, smoked lean tuna belly. Still craving more? Experience it once again in the warm chocolate bread pudding.",0,0
430,Allswell,Gastropub,2,"It's all good at this all-day Williamsburg tavern, where the vibe is welcoming and the setting is comfortable. Come as you are for friendly service amidst a patchwork of vintage wallpaper, then settle in to choose from the enjoyable selection listed on the wall-mounted blackboard. In keeping with the cozy atmosphere, brunch is served every day of the week. Offerings include eye-opening chorizo and beans with poached eggs; and smoked whitefish toast-house-baked brioche topped with fresh ricotta and large chunks of infused fish, sided by a perfect boiled egg and parsley salad. Dinner brings yet more comfort fare like orecchiette with lamb ragù and fava beans; grilled chicken with lentils; or divine sweets like a tall wedge of seed-crusted cinnamon cake.",0,0
431,River Styx,Contemporary,2,"Walk down Greenpoint Avenue and keep walking until you almost hit the East River to reach this newly launched venture. The setting is an undeniably cool combination of raw edges like rough timber ceiling beams, tables embedded with shards of glazed ceramic tile, and an open kitchen installed with a wood-burning oven. Take a look at the menu and find items like hake with raw almond butter. Sound familiar? This is the handiwork of Chef Dennis Spina, also of Roebling Tea Room. Choose from a tempting lineup and enjoy anchovies sitting by a fire; raviolo stuffed with Taleggio afloat in a bright green nettle broth; or morsels of braised pork dabbed with spicy tomatillo salsa. Vanilla panna cotta with blueberry and black vinegar compote is a lovely finish.",0,0
432,Lugo,Italian,2,"In a blah locale that's overshadowed by crowds spilling from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, this café shines bright as a recommendation for Italian eats. A boisterous scene prevails, as the bar and dining room are overwhelmingly popular among business folk. Light streaming in from the floor-to-ceiling windows shows off a white-tiled bar area and black-and-white photography. A pastel-green Vespa adds an extra dose of charm. Tables receive a satisfying array of items like warm hand-pulled mozzarella, Neapolitan-style pizza, and zesty entrées like Mediterranean branzino with spicy puttanesca. Pasta is deftly prepared and certainly a worthy indulgence, especially the tiny ridged tubes of rigatoncini coated with slow-cooked, meaty Bolognese.",0,0
433,El Parador,Mexican,2,"This neighborhood mainstay boasts over fifty years of success. With their fantastic menu, killer margaritas, and dedication to hospitality, El Parador is worthy of its status as a beloved destination. The intimate space is decked with ornate wood chairs, red banquettes, and wood plank ceilings, while white brick walls are hung with artwork and artifacts. The bountiful menu offers favorites like taco trays and nachos in three varieties, as well as a rotating menu of daily specials (be sure to try the fish of the day). Fill up on aguachile de camaron, deliciously classic shrimp ceviche in lime juice and jalapeño; or tender, falling-off-the-bone baby-back ribs served with tequila-chili guajillo salsa, cabbage slaw, and braised camote. Margaritas are a must, but of course.",0,0
434,Stella 34,Italian,2,"Windows overlook the Empire State Building at the long and light-filled Stella 34, located on the sixth floor of Macy's. The space is contemporary-with mosaic tile floors, bare tabletops, and coffee-colored banquettes-but the food is pure comfort, with three wood-burning ovens churning out Neapolitan-style pizzas. A meal at the curvaceous bar would best begin with some salumi and formaggi, or pappa al pomodoro thick with bread, tomato, Tuscan kale, white beans, and Pecorino Romano. Pasta is as enticing as the crispy pizzas-cresta di gallo satisfies with escarole maccheroni (in the shape of a rooster's crest) tossed with tomatoes, red onion, chilies, guanciale, and pecorino. For dessert, the renowned Vivoli gelato arrives here straight from Florence.",0,0
435,Paulie Gee's,Pizza,1,"Owner Paul Giannone, aka Paulie Gee, channeled a lifelong love of pizza into this charmingly delicious spot that feels as if it has been around forever. Rustic in appearance, the room's cool concrete and brick are warmed by the glow of the wood-burning oven imported from Naples. From here, Giannone and his son work their magic. The addictive crust is beguilingly moist and chewy, perfumed with smoke, and adroitly salted. Killer wood-fired pies dominate the menu with tempting combinations, excellent ingredients, and whimsical names. Offerings may include the Harry Belafontina-fontina, tomatoes, beefy meatballs, cremini mushrooms, and golden raisins. Vegans get equal respect here, with an added menu of vegan cheese and house-made vegan sausage.",0,0
436,Cho Dang Gol,Korean,1,"Among the delicious offerings that comprise the banchan welcoming diners to this hopping K-town spot, take note of the tofu. Warm, fluffy, and house-made, it's just one of the reasons why Cho Dang Gol is a standout for Korean cuisine. In fact, the restaurant is named for a South Korean village famous for its soybean curd. Next in line for your attention is a listing of bubbling-hot jjigaes featuring the likes of short rib, taro, and glass noodles. House specials like a wild sesame-and-mushroom casserole are also a hit. Though the staff can be brusquely efficient-a product of the high business volume-Korean artifacts and rustic wooden tables lend a sweet sentimentality to the place that, combined with the fresh, high-quality food, make it well worth a visit.",0,0
437,Madangsui,Korean,2,"With a menu that reads like a who's who list of Korean all-star dishes, Madangsui is one of those old-school joints that regulars and first-timers seem to enjoy equally well-most likely because when they do any one of their classic Korean dishes, they hit it out of the park. The setting is clean and simple (think Korean barbecue hall) and the staff genuinely warm and friendly, but the lip-smacking roster of classics is the real draw here. Past the lineup of terrific bi bim baps, don't miss the excellent mandu, fried to perfection and piped with tender pork and vegetables; or japchae, a sweet potato noodle stir fry; or one of the restaurant's increasingly popular lunch specials-imagine a refreshing bowl of naengmyeon served in icy cold broth.",0,0
438,Wild Edibles,Seafood,2,"A small, sleepy sign hides this particularly spare room outfitted with a counter and tightly spaced tables, and yet, this is every seafood fan's dream. Thanks to amiable service and one refreshingly uncomplicated objective-to prepare its catch simply but expertly-Wild Edibles has amassed a loyal following and quite rightly so. Start with locally sourced tuna tartare coupled with a light vinaigrette, garlic chips, and olive oil; or dig into clam chowder, a creamy, dreamy bowlful of plump bivalves, celery, potatoes, and smoky bacon. While the raw bar items are inviting and entrées delicious, you'll want to make like a regular here, and order a whole fish, sauce, as well as a side. Then wash it all down with a beer or glass of wine from the thoughtfully curated list.",0,0
439,Aita,Italian,2,"Tucked into a cozy corner, this quintessential trattoria echoes the beauty and charm of Clinton Hill. Amid a robust culinary scene, Aita finds a niche with its warm (never effusive) service and equally comforting décor of antique mirrors, wood paneling, and lacy curtains. Chef/co-owner Roberto Aita certainly has a way with pasta, crafting thick, homemade noodles twirled with flavorful sauces, such as the taglierini with buttery clam broth that is slightly sweet with melted leeks and strewn with irresistibly briny littlenecks. Italian tradition echoes through beguilingly simple desserts, like a bowl of plump fresh berries with nothing more than a dollop of cream and end-of-meal biscotti. The wines are as deliciously approachable as the cooking itself.",0,0
440,Pickle Shack,Gastropub,1,"Start with a menu that highlights the small-batch handiwork of Brooklyn Brine Co., then add an extensive assortment of beers from Dogfish Head Craft Brewery. Toss in wood tables, inviting counter seating, and dusky blue walls, and you have this enticing pub. Chef Neal Harden has put together a menu of suds-friendly food consisting of vegetarian snacks (think fried hop pickles with preserved lemon aïoli), and salads such as grilled romaine and Tuscan black kale with beluga lentils. Pickle Shack's lighter fare is rounded out by hearty, imaginative sandwiches crafted from local ingredients and purveyors. To that end, order the crusty artisan baguette filled with warm cannellini bean purée, grilled asparagus, and fennel-pickled beets.",0,0
441,Keens,Steakhouse,3,"When it comes to steakhouses, Keens is a New York original. Dating back to 1885, these rooms (the Lincoln, Lamb's, and Lillie Langtry) are imbued with Gilded Age charisma. Large tables are closely arranged under low ceilings lined with clay churchwarden pipes-a vestige of Keens' men-only, smoker's club days. Every night brings a full house of big appetites for belly-busting cuts of meat. Signature favorites include the mutton chop and Porterhouse sized for two or more, dry-aged in-house to achieve nutty perfection. For the complete experience, cover your table with fantastic sides like creamed spinach and hashbrowns. The Pub Room pours one of the most extensive selections of single malt Scotch around-happy hour brings complimentary nibbles.",0,0
442,Kristalbelli,Korean,3,"Turning up the heat in the dreary Garment District, Kristalbelli is a sexy harbinger of this fast-changing neighborhood. Outside, a gray slate- and marble-façade plus an impressive wooden door imply opulence; inside, crystal barbecue grills set on grey marble framed by a jolly gold monk make table-top dining over-the-top. The fun and bling continues upstairs in the young, hip, and hopping lounge. Yet amid all this glitz and glam is a well-trained service team and very talented kitchen. Banchan opens with a superlative assortment that might include green chilies with fermented bean paste, marinated mushrooms, cold egg custard with scallions, and kimchi. A sparkling signature crystal bowl does not distract from the deeply flavored, almost buttery ribeye.",0,0
443,Palo Santo,Latin American,2,"Jacques Gautier is the artiste behind this snug den cooking Latin and Caribbean cuisine. Nestled at the base of a townhouse, the dimly lit room makes for a lively (cue the salsa beats) yet intimate dining experience. Service can be slow, but nobody's in a hurry, so play along and make a night to remember. Closely set tables make privacy a challenge, but the arrival of crave-worthy pork tacos topped with creamy avocado, crunchy radish, and cilantro will keep your eyes on the prize. Find equal appeal in a fillet of roasted fluke set atop pickled purple cabbage, paired with a pineapple-habanero sauce that will make you singe with abandon, and scattered with tart tomatillo salsa. Still have room for more? Continue the feast across the street at Taco Santo.",0,0
444,Bricolage,Vietnamese,2,"This delicious and fresh-faced Vietnamese gem arrives courtesy of the team behind San Francisco's popular Slanted Door. Tucked into a simple, wood-and-exposed-brick space in family-friendly Park Slope, the restaurant's open kitchen bustles with energy as diners huddle in lively conversation. Bricolage bills itself as a gastropub (and the creative cocktails are certainly fantastic), but make no mistake-this is modern, next-level Vietnamese bar fare. Crispy, golden imperial rolls arrive stuffed with shiny glass noodles, crunchy cabbage, earthy mushrooms, and minced pork; while a dish of ""Unshaking Beef"" is laced in a light, salty-sweet marinade and seared to tender, juicy perfection alongside a peppery watercress salad.",0,0
445,Ai Fiori,Italian,4,"Elegantly accessed either by a sweeping spiral staircase or the Langham Place hotel elevator, Ai Fiori stands proudly above its busy Fifth Avenue address. Walls of windows and espresso-dark polished wood dominate the space. The Carrara marble bar and lounge furnished with silvery tufted banquettes are ideal for solo diners; large florals, brown leather chairs, and square columns adorn the formal dining room. No matter where you sit, the servers are attentive, the linens are thick, chargers are monogrammed with a goldleaf ""F"" and every last detail is very, very lovely. As one might expect of a Michael White restaurant, pastas here are masterful. Begin with perfectly al dente spaghetti evenly coated in subtly sweet tomato sauce with flakey crabmeat, gently spiced red chilies, and grated bottarga. Fish courses can be even more enticing. Dine on some of the brightest, freshest halibut known to this city, served on an excellent mix of smoky butter beans, chopped pancetta, artichokes, crispy golden croutons, and wonderfully minerally cavolo nero. Finish your meal on a tasty note with a passion fruit curd and mango jelly tartlet along with a crunchy cookie to accompany your cup of strong, hot coffee.",1,1
446,Frankie & Johnnie's,Steakhouse,3,"No surprise that this is a former speakeasy. The first floor is dedicated to drinking at the bar and booths filled with people sipping martinis before heading to Penn Station. Head upstairs, beyond an artistically assembled mound of wax over the vestibule, to enter this classic dining room. Spacious tables, crisp linens, and swift service ensure a steady business clientele. All in all, Frankie & Johnnie's is the kind of place where you shouldn't have to look at the menu. Just go with a nicely marbled, medium rare Porterhouse steak sliced tableside and served with the bone for gnawing. Traditional sides like whipped potatoes or creamed spinach push the limits with butter and cream. For dessert, the cheesecake is prepared with solid New York know-how.",0,0
447,Café China,Chinese,2,"An inconspicuous façade lost in midtown masks this striking restaurant, decorated with seductive portraits of 1930s Shanghai starlets, bright red chairs, lush bamboo planters, and a dominating marble-and-dark wood bar.The kitchen continues to struggle with popularity, yet on each table find balanced and elegant expressions of Sichuan cuisine that can stand above most in the city-one that avoids the easy umami of monosodium glutamate and egg rolls for composed, elegant expressions of this region's dishes. The almost overwhelming menu features dozens of cold and hot appetizers, noodles, entrées, and desserts. From refreshing pieces of cold-poached chicken tossed with a generous mound of chili-oil and peanuts, to aromatic smoked tofu mingled with silky batons of celery stalk, flavors here often bring more complexity than straight heat and the presentations are more genteel than brute. But that's not to say the kitchen doesn't conduct a fiery arrangement-try crisp, meaty, and double cooked pork belly harmonized with hot Sichuan peppercorns, green bell peppers, leeks, and fermented black beans. It's a face-melting experience that is more New York authentic, but still, devilishly delicious.",1,1
448,Morgan's BBQ,Barbecue,2,"Barbecue has been having a New York moment, mixing up sauces ranging from the vinegar-heavy Eastern NC-style to sweeter Tennessee renditions. At Morgan's, it's all about Texas, where there is an unparalleled emphasis on the quality of meat and smoke. The bare wood tables, plastic bottles, and industrial rolls of paper towels provide no dining frills-not that they are missed. Come hungry for slow-smoked brisket with a spicy and inspired rub that's straight out of Austin. Hard to find outside the state, the Hill Country specialty of deep-fried turkey tails is especially tender, served over porky collard greens and salty-sweet cornbread with pepper jelly. Sides are to die for; same goes for the signature pecan ""cutie pie"" made with Widow Jane Bourbon.",0,0
449,Umi NOM,Asian,2,"Discerning Pratt students likely inspired the team behind Umi NOM, a fun and adventurous area standout. Outfitted in wood paneling and pew-like benches, the narrow space incorporates intriguing design elements and bamboo ornaments to keep the eyes as pleased as the palate-and rises well above the typical takeout joints that line this unremarkable block. The lack of a liquor license is all but forgotten with a sip of the thirst-quenching calamansi juice to pair with fusion tacos stuffed with strips of pig's ear, pickled onions, smoked spicy salsa, and more. Don't miss the pad krapow made with ground beef, long beans, Thai chilies, and clove-like holy basil. Pork belly adobo, braised for three hours in coconut milk and spices, is a thing of beauty.",0,0
450,Anella,Contemporary,2,"Tucked away in Greenpoint, just a few blocks from the East River, Anella hosts diners in an intimate rough and tumble space boasting a sliver of a dining room, charming back patio, and welcoming bar fashioned out of a reclaimed work bench from the Steinway & Sons piano factory. The kitchen is on display and sends forth a menu of ambitious creations, beginning with a loaf of bread freshly baked and served in a clay flowerpot. Smoke was a recent inspiration as seen in a slice of brisket afloat in a lusciously fluid risotto of spinach and garlic. Other preparations have included seared striped bass paired with lentils and cauliflower that was roasted and whirled into a purée; and a finale of apple crémeux atop almond cake sided by rum ice cream.",0,0
451,Franny's,Italian,2,"This timeless neighborhood staple keeps its crowds happy with two wood-burning ovens that churn out lovely thin-crust pizzas. The long bar will likely be your first stop with excellent cocktails that help pass the wait time. The warm space has colorful patterned floor tiles and neatly stacked cords of wood for those crackling ovens. The open kitchen provides a bit of theater as pies are plucked from the oven-that delicate pizza topped with tomato, sausage, and mozzarella is simple and satisfying. True Italian spirit shines in the carefully executed bucatini with garlic, anchovies, chilies, and toasted breadcrumbs, even if portions are a bit shy. Thankfully there may be more room for dessert, so go for the crunchy cannolo filled with lemon ricotta.",0,0
452,Al di Là,Italian,2,"This long-loved Park Slope gem from husband-and-wife team Emiliano Coppa and Chef Anna Klinger (of the Crown Heights café Lincoln Station) has been deliciously consistent over the years. Inviting and lived-in with wooden pew seating, dainty wallpaper, and a blown glass chandelier, it's both comfortable and chic enough for a romantic dinner a due. Al di Là's Italian delights are northern in spirit and include enticing preparations. A salad of roughly chopped escarole is tossed with thinly shaved Jerusalem artichokes, slivers of red onion, diced crisped pancetta, toasted walnuts, and a warm sherry vinaigrette. When offered, the lasagna alla Bolognese, fashioned from sheets of fresh pasta and served hot from the oven with crisped edges, is a must.",0,0
453,The Finch,American,3,"Chef Gabe McMackin has nailed the definition of the perfect neighborhood restaurant, making it well worth a trip to this charming Brooklyn quarter no matter where you live. Step through the bright blue façade to find a welcoming vibe, contemporary rustic décor-complete with wood beam ceilings and farmhouse chairs-and seriously enjoyable food. Having incorporated a former tattoo parlor and storefront, The Finch sprawls out into a series of cozy nooks. At the heart of the operation is an open kitchen where the chef, a Roberta's alum, guides his team to excellence before an audience of diners seated at a Carrara marble counter. Modern yet comforting, the beautiful creations to be enjoyed here are a show of skill and personality. Asparagus is the very symbol of spring when slashed into matchsticks and thrown over a quivering orb of burrata accurately brought to room temperature and accompanied by charred young onions. Chicken is rescued from the mundane as crispy-skinned white meat partnered with a poached egg and smoked bread pudding, all ringed by an intense consommé. Unsurprisingly, dessert is divine, revealing crumbly shortcake filled with sour cherry compote and dabbed with whipped cream.",1,1
454,Karczma,Polish,1,"Located in a slice of Greenpoint that still boasts a sizeable Polish population, Karczma offers a lovely old-world ambience that may belie its age (opened for five-plus years) but perfectly matches its very traditional, budget-friendly menu. Hearty offerings may include peasant-style lard mixed with bacon and spices, or a plate of Polish specialties piled high with pierogies (three varieties, steamed or fried, topped with sliced onions and butter), kielbasa, potato pancakes, hunter's stew, and stuffed cabbage. Grilled plates can be prepared for two or three, while others, like the roasted hocks in beer, could easily feed an army. The quaint, farmhouse-inspired interior is efficiently staffed with smiling servers in floral skirts and embroidered vests.",0,0
455,Larb Ubol,Thai,1,"Chef Ratchanee Sumpatboon is cooking up her own delicious Isaan-Thai storm in Hell's Kitchen. Inconspicuously lodged between Penn Station and Port Authority, Larb Ubol is tidy, cheerful, and dressed with colorful fabrics. The som tom kort muar is cool and limey yet very spicy with green and red chilies dotting the crunchy mound of lettuce, green papaya, rice noodles, and fried pork rind. Savory and satisfying pla dook larb, a spicy ground catfish salad, combines wild ginger, fresh mint, and lime. The deep-fried pork belly, pad ped moo krob, is rendered crisp yet wonderfully chewy, then stir-fried with chopped eggplant, sweet red pepper, and red curry paste. Cool off with a scoop of coconut ice cream garnished with preserved palm seeds.",0,0
456,Tempura Matsui,Japanese,4,"With a whopping 40 years of experience in Japan under his belt, tempura master Chef Masao Matsui requires just three ingredients-flour, water, and egg-to transform a larder of exceptionally fresh seafood and vegetables into a feast unlike any other in New York City. Tempura Matsui is tucked into the corner of a non-descript residential tower, lending an air of Japanese authenticity from its location that's amplified by a luxuriously old-world interior. A counter surrounding the chef's station seats a row of Matsui aficionados set comfortably with lacquer trays, handmade ceramic platters, and gorgeous implements, while a handful of booths offer a much more limited view of the virtuoso proceedings. Diners hoping for fare with American flair will be disappointed, as the food here caters to students of traditional Japanese cuisine. Chef Matsui is a watchful presence, guiding his sous-chefs to produce pieces that are pale gold, delicately crisp, and perfectly cooked. House-made goma dofu, chawan mushi, and sashimi begin the feast, but as lovely as these bites are, they are merely the opening act for the divine tempura-mouthwatering shrimp head, sweet hunk of King crabmeat, and seaweed-wrapped scallop.",1,1
457,Lan Sheng,Chinese,2,"Midday hordes gathered outside its plain-Jane façade evidences the popularity of this midtown Sichuan stop. The pleasant and comfy interior fashioned from high-backed banquettes, wood-carved wall hangings, and colorful accent lights provides a respite once you make it through the doors. Recent experiences have indicated inconsistent cooking, but the fiery and smoky specialties here are still praiseworthy. Nibble on a crispy pile of camphor tea-smoked duck while waiting for the standout items to arrive. These may include miso- and chili-simmered whole fish showered with green onion; strips of bitter melon dressed with black bean sauce; as well as shredded potatoes shined with oil, vinegar, and hit with dried red plus thinly sliced green chilies.",0,0
458,Szechuan Gourmet,Chinese,2,"Come lunchtime, midtown office workers with a jones for the tingly heat of Sichuan peppercorns or the burn of bright red chili oil know exactly where to go. A queue for tables is nearly obligatory, but the pace settles down in the evening and on weekends. Inside, red lanterns and pink linens accent the bustling room and servers attend to tables where specialties are piled high. Though the menu is vast, you can't go wrong by tearing into the best scallion pancakes in town; or cool, hand-shredded chicken draped in a creamy sesame paste and chili oil. Smoked tofu shreds tossed with Asian celery and toasted sesame oil; or wok-tossed jumbo prawns with a crispy shell of peppercorns and spiced salt are the reason for those long lines.",0,0
459,Mapo Tofu,Chinese,1,"""How many?"" That's the greeting at this temple of ""ma la,"" where enticing aromas are sure to lure you in. Find yourself among executives and locals slurping up a host of chili oil specialties (don't wear white!). This is the kind of place where dragons go to recharge their breath. Some may peruse the menu-rife with typos-for daily specials, but most blaze their tongues with Sichuan pickles or chilled noodles tossed in an intense sesame vinaigrette. The place is named after a humble dish, but many items surprise with bold flavors like silky fish fillets swimming in a spicy broth with Napa cabbage, or camphor tea-smoked duck. Peppercorns in stir-fried chicken unite subtle sweetness with intense heat, while sponge squash offers a cooling, textural finale.",0,0
460,James,American,2,"This phenomenal little jewel of a restaurant feels as though it has been presiding over this corner for a hundred years. Pressed-tin ceilings and creaky wood floors make it a nostalgic spot, with modern touches like the Dutch Lucite chandelier lending a chic, romantic vibe. The owners take every detail seriously, from the herb garden on the roof to that wonderful ""Cecil & Merl"" cheesecake they sell online. The contemporary American cooking highlights top ingredients handled with great care, as in delicate celery root soup topped with silky smoked trout and sharp wasabi sprouts. Generous pastas include enticingly chewy trofie enrobed in a pale sauce of puréed greens balancing tart Meyer lemon, earthy sautéed mushrooms, and sharp Pecorino sardo shavings.",0,0
461,Casa Nonna,Italian,2,"Quaint sounding Casa Nonna is actually a behemoth of a restaurant run by an international dining group. A boon to garment district workers and suburban commuters, this sprawling, multi-room space is just a few blocks away from bustling Penn Station and the Port Authority bus terminal. There is a dish for every taste at Casa Nonna, whose attractive menu is replete with satisfying and well-prepared Roman and Tuscan fare. Panini and Neapolitan-style pizza are popular during lunchtime, while dinner serves a hearty lineup of primi such as tagliolini frutti di mare, with fine breadcrumbs clinging the vibrant tomato sauce to the pasta. Entrées feature grilled Cornish hen, spiced alla diavola-style with garlic, lemon, and hot pepper.",0,0
462,Tavola,Italian,2,"This Hell's Kitchen pizzeria is housed in the former Manganaro's Grosseria Italiano, a family-run emporium dating back to 1893. Bright and clean but boasting the patina of its long existence, the dining room now greets guests with a wall of Italian products and a sky-lit double pizza oven. The wood-burning dome crafted of volcanic clay from Mt. Vesuvius produces an array of blistered, chewy, quality-topped pies such as the Baresa, bearing sweet fennel sausage, broccoli rabe, and roasted breadcrumbs. Grilled local calamari with lemon-caper salmoriglio can be found among the starters. The pastas are also an excellent choice, especially lasagna della casa, stacking fresh sheets with bright and saucy veal ragù, ricotta, and mozzarella di bufala.",0,0
463,Phoenix Garden,Chinese,2,"This fuss-free and no-frills basement joint shows Chinatown that delicious Chinese food for a great value can exist outside of its borders. Forgo ho-hum lunch deals and pop in at dinnertime for a delectable selection of Cantonese cooking. The vast menu can take some navigating, so chat up the servers for their expert advice in order to get the goods. Highlights include exquisite salt-and-pepper shrimp, shell-on, butterflied, flash-fried and tossed with sliced chilies and garlic; sautéed snow pea leaves in an egg-white sauce of sweet crabmeat, carrots, and snow peas; sizzling eggplant casserole studded with minced pork and ham; and crispy Peking duck sliced tableside, rolled up in pancakes, and layered with hoisin, cucumber, and scallions.",0,0
464,Brooklyn Star,American,2,"Chef Joaquin Baca's handiwork at Brooklyn Star displays a fun and creative streak that yields admirable results. Pork chops are brined with molasses, striped bass is poached in duck fat, and roasted chicken is glazed with sweet tea and plated with dirty rice. Gluttony will convince you to bolster a meal here with bacon-jalapeño cornbread or buttermilk biscuits. But, let restraint chime in with a tasty raw kale salad; starring golden raisins, toasted peanuts, lemon vinaigrette, and a lacy cheddar crisp on top, it's pleasure on a plate. Though the focus is on the eats, the room is comfortably outfitted with brick red terrazzo floors and grey-trimmed walls. Blonde wood tables are set with bottles of hot sauce, pepper vinegar, and wild flowers.",0,0
465,Locanda Vini e Olii,Italian,2,"This elder statesman of Clinton Hill feels like it was dreamed up by the charming townhouses and tree-lined neighborhood it has served for over a decade. Through lace-covered windows, the dining room flickers its candlelight with unabashed romance. The room is actually a repurposed 19th century apothecary that awakens such historic details as rolling ladders and small wooden drawers. Begin with diverse antipasti, including custardy cauliflower sformato di cavolfiore set atop puréed spinach. Unusual paste include tiny house-made gnocchetti tossed with clams, mussels, and tender shrimp over perfectly braised broccoli rabe. Move on to a restrained and luscious Hudson Valley duck breast, then finish with a warm chocolate torte topped with caramel sauce.",0,0
466,Stone Park Cafe,Contemporary,2,"A true neighborhood place that feels fuss-free, laidback, and just right for lingering, this little corner eatery makes the most of its large windows peering onto Park Slope's vibrant thoroughfare and small nearby park. The airy interior has exposed brick walls, a long bar near the entrance for pre-dinner cocktails, and a candlelit, sunken dining room scattered with linen-topped tables. Satisfying light fare includes grilled baby octopus with chorizo and fingerling potatoes, or grilled lacinato kale served over a frisée salad with tangy buttermilk dressing. Mains like pork loin over Brussels sprouts and rainbow carrots are hearty, and may be tailed by such inventive treats as a mini ravioli-shaped puff pastry baked atop a nutty and crumbly apple cookie.",0,0
467,El Born,Spanish,2,"Hip and happening Greenpoint is a highly appropriate location for this tapas den named after the equally trendy Barcelona district of El Born. The slender expanse of red brick and concrete is brightened by a neon squiggle suspended from the ceiling, red Shaker-style chairs, and a kitchen-fronting wall clad with encaustic cement tile. A tray of crostini, simmered tomato, and garlic cloves is served gratis, for a do-it-yourself pan con tomate to stimulate the palate for what's to come. Enjoy croquetes oozing goat cheese and served with apple compote; or shaved summer squash with ibérico ham, blueberries, and padrón pepper vinaigrette. Stone-grilled octopus seasoned with olive oil, thyme, and paprika is a pretty plate packed with big flavors.",0,0
468,Krolewskie Jadlo,Polish,1,"Krolewskie Jadlo (""king's feast"" in Polish) sits in a Greenpoint enclave that was once home to a large number of Polish immigrants. Although the size of the community has decreased through the years, the area still thrives with a distinct Eastern European soul. The room is pleasant and routinely packed with crowds basking in the enjoyable authenticity. The Polish plate brings all one could hope for in a hearty old-world platter: cabbage rolls stuffed with ground beef and braised in tart tomato sauce; pan-fried potato pierogis; and a link of smoky kielbasa. Other items are just as tasty, like the pounded pork shoulder steak, grilled and brushed with honey, and served with pickled cabbage and beets.A second outpost is located in Ridgewood, Queens.",0,0
469,Elberta,Southern,2,"Elberta has certainly found her groove. This soulful speakeasy that pays homage to a jazz singer and the fuzzy Elberta peach drink, also dedicates nights to live music and creative cocktails. Her approachable vibe leads right into a Southern-inspired menu, featuring elegant interpretations of the usual suspects, including dessert: fantastic brioche doughnuts stuffed with sweet potato, caramel, and chocolate sauce. But before the sweet tooth kicks in, try curry goat-stuffed ravioli in a creamy, cauliflower-based sauce; or Creole fisherman's stew dominated by whole prawns, scallops, mussels, and octopus. Use toasted sourdough or dirty rice loaded with gizzards and chicken liver to sop up the cherry-red tomato base, spiked with peppers, herbs, and spices.",0,0
470,Speedy Romeo,American,2,"Named for a racehorse and just as focused and quick, Speedy Romeo is in for a successful run. Part tavern, part roadside grill, its kitschy décor and modern touches transform this former automotive shop into a surprisingly attractive spot. The owner benefited from years at Jean-Georges' empire, and that intelligence and experience is conveyed through the smart accents and whimsical menu that begins with Italian ingredients. Look to the wood-burning oven for smoky, meaty artichoke halves topped with lemon aïoli, sourdough crumbs, mint, and peppery arugula. Take a chance on the non-traditional but utterly fantastic pizza combinations, such as the St. Louis, layering a proper crust with meats, pickled chillies, and Midwestern Provel cheese.",0,0
471,Luksus at Tørst,Contemporary,4,"Enter through Tørst, wander to the back, and find Luksus-it's like unearthing a little boudoir behind a beer bar. The small, highly Instagrammable room has a Scandinavia-via-Brooklyn look, with a choice marble dining counter for chef viewing and a smattering of tables. Sure, the crowd is heavily tattooed and tight-shirted, but this is no place for poseurs. Luksus has an artsy edge that cements Greenpoint's status as the current hotbed of NY cool. Cue the Girls location scouts. The young staff may be hipsters, but everyone is passionate, friendly, and can recite beer history like it's their catechism. Absolutely go for the pairing. The cuisine is firmly rooted in Scandinavian techniques and ingredients, with inspiration from afar and unfussy flashes of tinkered modernism. Simple staples add drama through spears of crusty sourdough with mouthwatering salty cultured butter. This may lead to barely smoked bluefish set over sunchoke salad, finished tableside in warm broth. Humble palate cleansers more than serve a purpose in the tart, tangy sea buckthorn sorbet with carrot sauce. Clever desserts include the sandy-brown malt granita over parsnip purée dotted with little kisses of cranberry meringue.",1,1
472,Forcella,Pizza,1,"This favored pizzeria offers a convivial vibe in a quaint setting that is simply decorated with white stucco walls and brass sconces. The wood-burning domed pizza oven, encrusted with shards of black tile, is the heart of Forcella. It pumps out a listing of signature pies built upon disks of moist chewy dough that is charred in all the right places, like the pignasecca. A sauce-less pizza Bianca, it's strewn with bits of caramelized onions, crumbles of fennel sausage, and gobs of fresh mozzarella and fontina. Also try the montanara, a house specialty crust that's fried before being decked and then baked as a traditional Margherita. If that doesn't do the trick, create your own pie with any combination from their wide selection of toppings.",0,0
473,Okonomi,Japanese,1,"A small counter and a handful of tables is the extent of this tiny café headed by Chef Yuji Haraguchi, famous for his ramen pop-ups. Regardless of the time of day, Okonomi's delightfully unconstrained Japanese cuisine is a compelling reason to visit. Locally grown produce and domestic fish are the foundation of the high-quality ichiju sansei, a set lunch of shioyaki (salt-grilled) or miso-marinated broiled fish, rice, miso soup, and shira-ae (wilted greens with a tofu dressing). Come evening, the focus shifts to ramen, with each steaming bowl bearing the distinctive hand of the skilled chef. A surf-and-turf broth stocked with thin, straight noodles and roasted fish is just one example; while broth-less mazeman is dressed for the season.",0,0
474,Mercato,Italian,2,"Italian hospitality with a Pugliese accent is on display at Mercato, a rustic trattoria in the western midtown hinterlands. The space is country-chic, with distressed wood tables, soft, exposed bulbs, and vintage signs. The atmosphere is inviting and the menu is inspired by the classic dishes of Puglia, the birthplace of owner Fabio Camardi. First get a drink in your hand, then start with fave e cicoria, a straightforward purée of fava beans and garlicky chicory greens. A well-rounded Italian meal must have pasta, so be sure to indulge in the likes of orecchiette with broccoli rabe and garlic, enhanced with anchovies and breadcrumbs. For something deeply satisfying, try the fennel-dusted porchetta with a hearty side of potato and green cabbage mash.",0,0
475,Snack EOS,Greek,2,"Found just steps away from traffic-clogged Port Authority is this boon to the dining landscape of a workaday quarter of Hell's Kitchen. Come for lunch and find corporate types enjoying a respite in the small cheerful room as they dig into cool salads and hot grilled skewers washed down with mint lemonade. Mediterranean flavors frame the cooking here, so expect to enjoy vibrant items like melitzanosalata scooped up with pita chips from the meze selection-a spread of roasted eggplant seasoned with plenty of fresh garlic, red wine vinegar, diced red pepper, and chopped parsley. Delicious kalamaki (skewers) of chicken breast, thigh meat confit, and onions are grilled, brushed with lemon-honey vinaigrette, and set over a farro salad studded with sun-dried tomatoes.",0,0
476,Le Fond,French,2,"Chef-owner Jake Eberle's cute corner restaurant shows us that not every dish needs reimagining and not every recipe requires reinterpretation. He's a French-trained chef whose cooking is crisp, clean, and comfortingly classic-and his well-balanced menu includes words like ""roulade"" and ""blancmange"" that here seem curiously reassuring. That's not to say his food doesn't pack a punch: the rich, meaty cassoulet could keep an army on the march for days. Globe lights hang from the ceiling to illuminate a sea-blue room with bespoke wooden furniture. The acoustics can be bouncy and those lacking the necessary padding will find the seating a little numbing. But, there is honest toil and earnest endeavor happening here and it deserves support.",0,0
477,Pera,Turkish,2,"For fantastically flavorful Turkish food mingled with modern influences, Pera never fails to please. Lunch does big business in this attractive dining room, layered in a chocolate-brown color scheme and packed with corporate groups and visitors looking for a sleek place to roost. Though dinner is more low-key, the menu always boasts simple and exceptional plates like warm hummus with pastirma; lentil and bulgur tartare; as well as watermelon chunks tossed with feta, fresh tomatoes, and a perfect trickle of olive oil. While service can verge on disorganized, all will be forgiven after a forkful of their classic and tender chicken adana or lamb burger-a juicy bunful of ground lamb coupled with garlic spread, homemade pickles, and addictively crispy fries.",0,0
478,Juventino,Contemporary,2,"A lovely storefront opens into this airy restaurant with distressed wood details and whitewashed walls lending a rustic farmhouse vibe. Tables are lined with pages from old cookbooks and the walls have vintage mirrors and shelves stocked with an impressive selection of cookbooks. This Latin-influenced neighborhood spot also has a seasonal back patio for alfresco dining. Daily brunch makes the most of the bright, sunny eggs that enhance many dishes, especially the lush yolks that ooze into the herbaceous pumpkin seed mole over potato hash with thinly sliced chunks of tender lengua. A deliciously chewy grain salad popping with quinoa, barley, and tender beluga lentils in a tart, lemony vinaigrette is a healthy, tasty pick-and an easy favorite.",0,0
479,Gabriel Kreuther,Contemporary,4,"The Grace Building's swooping white travertine façade is a bulwark for the spacious and serene treasure within, a familiar name that has once again brightened Manhattan's dining scene. Don't let the oasis of nearby Bryant Park distract you from this new destination, where cream leather seating, reclaimed timber columns, and a glass-walled display kitchen combine for a uniquely pulled together enclave boasting a luxe lounge area. Chef Gabriel Kreuther's Alsatian heritage provides a distinctive mark here, evinced by the stork imagery throughout and by his exciting cuisine espousing regional pride. His elegantly composed sturgeon and sauerkraut tart is a delightful signature creation adorned with American caviar and infused with smoke. Frilly cones of nori-enriched pasta are presented with meaty slices of Alaskan king crab and parsnip purée; while lusciously tender Maine lobster poached in Mangalitsa lardo is dressed with jamón emulsion. Kreuther has brought back the palate cleanser, updated and perfectly executed, to prepare you for the finale which may be titled ""Contemporary"" and reveal pistachio genoise and vanilla cream encased in dark cherry gelée topped with lime-vanilla sorbet.",1,1
480,The Saint Austere,Contemporary,1,"Sometimes all one needs is a fine glass of wine and a little snack (or three). For this, The Saint Austere fits the bill nicely. Platings bring on far-flung influences-as in the bánh Mi(lano), pork terrine, thinly shaved mortadella, and house-pickled vegetables sandwiched into a toasted baguette moistened by a chili-flecked dressing. However, the menu's truest muse is a general coupling of Italian and Spanish flavors, such as pork belly croquetas accompanied by a dipping sauce of crushed chicken livers; or slow-cooked polenta topped with sweet onions caramelized in sausage drippings. The spartanly adorned room offers a hospitable bar in addition to three communal tables. And the wine list proffers a gently priced selection of mostly European labels.",0,0
481,Greenpoint Fish & Lobster Co.,Seafood,2,"Fronted by green awnings, and flooded with light, this corner gem is equal parts sustainably sourced fish market and fantastic eat-in spot. Walk past iced specimens to claim a seat at the white marble counter; then dig into the day's catch dressed-up with global influences. New England clam chowder is given the classic treatment, while grilled sea bass skewers are accompanied by a Thai coconut-and-peanut dipping sauce. Local fluke touched by extra virgin olive oil, a squeeze of Meyer lemon, and Maldon sea salt is an example of the first-rate crudo of the day; while Baja-style fish tacos feature tortillas stuffed with fried pollack, shredded cabbage, and chipotle-lime mayonnaise. For the fish-free, a raw vegan kelp noodle-pad Thai is remarkably satisfying.",0,0
482,Al Seabu,Malaysian,1,"The already impressive Park Slope dining scene gets another notch in its belt with Al Seabu, a little family-run restaurant with a seafood-centric menu and big personality. Decorated in cheerful sea-blue walls and industrial shelves lined with charming seashells, Al Seabu also boasts a friendly staff and fun, contemporary music. The overall effect is one of relaxed charm-and that's before the food knocks your socks off. Don't miss the grilled pulut panggang, little cigars of sticky rice dabbed with coconut and shrimp paste; or fork-tender nyonya beef rendang served with a pile of fluffy white rice and cool slices of cucumber and tomato to cut the heat. Fried mantou, hot sweet buns served with creamy condensed milk for dipping, makes for a dreamy finish.",0,0
483,Osteria Laguna,Italian,2,"A little bit corporate (it is midtown, after all) and a little bit casual (daytrippers from nearby Grand Central), Osteria Laguna has nailed its audience and delivers a perfect blend to suit both worlds. Inside, it's delightfully rustic, complete with the requisite Italian ceramic plates and wooden chairs with rush seating. Crowd-pleasers like pastas, pizzas from the wood-burning oven, antipasti, salads, and nicely done fish, starch, and vegetables comprise the menu at this better-than-average gem. The friendly service can be spotty, but the perfectly crisped wood-fired pizzas are always spot on. The portions are abundant, perhaps even too much given the tiny tables, but the prices aren't, so you can treat your out-of-town friend and keep the change.",0,0
484,Sushi Yasuda,Japanese,4,"Efficiency trumps hospitality at this sushi temple, where warm honey-toned bamboo slats are by far the warmest feature. Reservations are managed with little coddling, arrivals lack any greeting, tardiness is not accepted, and loitering at the counter is not an option. But to sushi-loving diehards, this is just the cost of admission. Tables packed with suits (this is midtown, after all) should be avoided in favor of the sleek counter attended to by a pristinely attired staff as this is where the magic happens. And, your experience here depends entirely on the itamae enlisted in front of you. Their mission is to ensure that each diner receives fish that has just been cut, formed, and dressed moments before it is eaten. After years of buildup, this kitchen is finally living up to its hype-with a wealth of classically assembled and spectacularly fresh sushi on offer. Every item is handled with such care and is truly memorable: a sparkling combo of sea scallop and oyster is sprinkled with soy sauce, sea salt, and lemon; a duo of uni lets the palate compare specimens from Santa Barbara and Hokkaido; and a trio of King, Alaskan white, and wild New Zealand salmon nigiri makes for a fantastic treat.",1,1
485,Aureole,Contemporary,4,"Nestled smack dab in the middle of the melee that constitutes modern-day Times Square, Aureole's message is clear from the moment you enter its serene glass façade: drop your bags (and perhaps your shoulders) and relax-it's time to be pampered by a truly exquisite seafood-centric meal in a luxurious setting. Up front, you'll find the Liberty Room, home to a lively bar that's ideal for an after-work drink or pre-dinner cocktail; and a small collection of handsome, walnut-topped tables comprising a more casual dining area. Toward the back of the restaurant, the formal dining room cuts an impressive, elegant figure with sexy low lighting; crisp white tablecloths; and polished table settings. Dinner might begin with a beautifully composed peekytoe crab salad, sporting vibrant green avocado panna cotta, juicy watermelon and sea beans; and then move on to a gorgeous slice of fresh Alaskan black cod in a sweet and savory marinade, paired with crisp snap peas, bok choy, and choy sum. End with a stunning finale like the elegantly prepared Saint Honoré, a flaky tuille topped with a flower-shaped pinwheel piped with silky Manjari chocolate mousse and dotted with light-as-air choux puffs.",1,1
486,Cooklyn,Contemporary,2,"Work from local artists, a smattering of reclaimed objects, and whitewashed exposed brick walls set a cozy, inviting scene at Cooklyn. The vibe is warm and homey, and a variety of wines-poured by both the glass and quartino-encourage lingering in the clean, uncluttered dining room with its white marble-topped bar, semi-exposed kitchen, and bare wood tables. Slices of fluke, topped with a whisper of yuzu, maple, basil purée, and a sprinkle of sea salt is a delicate start, while the lamb bun is slathered with feta cream and stuffed with tender meat, fresh dill, and pickled onion. Flavors are just as intense in the entrées, from the sea urchin fusilli with lump crabmeat to the seared duck breast over cous cous with a tart fennel-and-pomegranate salad.",0,0
487,Black Swan,American,2,"You can't go wrong at Black Swan, so slide into a dark wooden booth, order a craft beer, and strike up a conversation with the other diners crammed into the deep, long space. As young as this American gastropub is, it feels as comfortable and rustic as a well-worn pair of jeans-just right for settling into a fast-paced match on TV. True to its pub spirit, the food keeps pace with the ample beer list with a crackling, tender, and moist crab cake, fried until golden and topped with a deeply spiced remoulade. Deep bowls of turkey chili are rich and hearty, with loads of ground turkey, cumin, and bits of smoky bacon served with fluffy white rice and cornbread. Sea bass with wild mushroom ragout, cilantro, and grapefruit is effortlessly enjoyable.",0,0
488,Sakagura,Japanese,3,"Got sake on the brain? You'll need to book in advance, but tucked away in the basement of a midtown office building, Sakagura is an amazing little hideaway with a phenomenal sake list (including seasonal selections) and a smattering of delicious small plates for pairing. All this fabulousness may have gone to their head a bit as the service seems a bit lacking these days, but it's worth it for that flash of authentic Tokyo by way of midtown. A couple of gems off the massive menu include the uzaku, grilled eel with cucumbers and seaweed in vinaigrette; perfectly chewy soba noodles presented in a traditional basket with dipping sauce, scallion, and wasabi; and tender tori karaage, a delicious Japanese fried chicken marinated in sake, soy, and ginger.",0,0
489,Soba Totto,Japanese,2,"It's a jam-packed lunchtime operation here at Soba Totto, where business folks gather and quickly fill the popular space. As the name suggests, everyone arrives in droves for the tasty homemade soba. Dinnertime brings a mellower vibe, and a crowd of beer- and sake-sipping patrons ordering tasty plates of spicy fried chicken and yakitori galore. Midday features several varieties of lunch sets. Tasty appetizers may unveil a salad of assorted pickles and simmered daikon in a sweet ginger dressing. Skip over the fried seafood in favor of the soba totto gozen set, which includes the wonderful soba in fragrant dashi; or try one of the many delicious dons topped with tasty tidbits like sea urchin and salmon roe or soy-marinated tuna, grated yam, and egg.",0,0
490,Sushi Zen,Japanese,3,"Sushi Zen's peaceful interior and intimate scale is a welcomed contrast to its high-traffic location. Tall ceilings and pale earthy hues combine for a soothing look that is accentuated by wood flooring, stone, and an artful tangle of bamboo stalks. The counter is bright, comfortable, and puts you in view of Chef Toshio Suzuki in action. Lunchtime brings crowds who come for the excellent value set sushi menu. A salad with ginger-based dressing and delicately crisp tempura of shrimp, seasonal vegetables, and yuba precede excellent quality Edomae-sushi, featuring rice seasoned with the chef's own vinegar. Bite-sized pieces can include translucent fluke spiked with wasabi; Spanish mackerel sprinkled with grated ginger and chopped green onion; or warm unagi.",0,0
491,Osteria al Doge,Italian,2,"Theater District dining can seem uninspired next to Osteria al Doge. Here, sunny yellow walls, rustic farmhouse tables topped with fresh flowers, and a staff that's genuinely gracious even while attending to the lunchtime throngs make up a completely charming package. As if in defiance of its bustling locale, this authentic osteria gives much cause to sit and savor. The menu offers a taste of Venice in a range of specialties that include risotto nero, pan-roasted calf's livers in an onion gravy, and grilled prawns over soft polenta with sweet paprika sauce. Daily specials are another enjoyable way to go, as in the velvet-smooth, dairy-free spinach soup buoyed by a fontina crostini; or cavatelli tossed with sausage, sweet peas, and creamy tomato sauce.",0,0
492,The Lambs Club,American,3,"On a storied stretch dotted by blue-blooded social institutions and boutique hotels (like the Chatwal which also happens to be its home) find The Lamb's Club, named for the theater group that once resided here. Helmed by Chef/restaurateur Geoffrey Zakarian and reimagined by designer Thierry Despont, this handsome retreat is a glamorous art deco backdrop of ebonized walls and red leather seating set aglow by stainless steel torchieres and a fireplace. It's a fitting scene for the novel American food that follows. Try slow-poached halibut with crispy frog's legs and licorice herbs, paired with seasonal sides like roasted carrots with prune purée and pecan granola. End with apple crisp ""tatin"" sandwiching flaky pastry, roasted apples, and caramel mousse.",0,0
493,db Bistro Moderne,Contemporary,3,"Chef Daniel Boulud's midtown canteen is fashioned by Jeffrey Beers and dons a contemporary demeanor. The front lounge is abuzz with post-work and pre-theater gaggles, while well-behaved crowds in the back are seated in a walnut-paneled space dressed with mirrors and black-and-white photography. Like its setting, the menu is inventive and unites classic bistro cooking with market-inspired creations. That lush pâté en croute is a buttery pastry encasing layers of creamy country pâté, guinea hen, and foie gras, dressed with huckleberry compote, toasted pine nuts, and pickled enoki mushrooms. Wild rice-crusted fluke presented with Hawaiian blue prawn and sauce Américaine further demonstrate the kitchen's contemporary leanings.",0,0
494,Hakkasan,Chinese,4,"When you fancy eating somewhere sensual and sophisticated, then going to the Theater District is unlikely to be your first thought. At least this sleek, moodily-lit Chinese restaurant comes with an 80-foot corridor behind its front door, allowing you time to adjust from tourist town to sexy sanctum. Cobalt-blue glass, marble and mirrors help create a striking space that feels surprisingly intimate considering its size. Service may need the occasional prompt but the Cantonese food is good and the cocktails terrific. Standouts are stir-fried sugar pea shoots with crabmeat and scallops, and jasmine tea-smoked chicken. And if you're wondering how they charge what they do for sesame prawn toast, order it and you'll see (clue: it's the foie gras).",0,0
495,Aburiya Kinnosuke,Japanese,3,"Call it a trip to Tokyo without the tariff. This dark, sophisticated Japanese izakaya is tucked down a side street in bustling midtown. Grab an intimate table for two or join the crowd at the open kitchen counter surrounding the smoky robata grill. The waiters talk up the omakase, but it's worth trusting your own instincts to guide you on a personalized tour through their authentic offerings. The sukiyaki is a must-try seasonal offering of tender marbled beef served in a hot pot bobbing with a beaten egg, tofu, vegetables, and noodles. Other favorites include smoky bamboo shoots fresh off the robata with shaved bonito; and their legendary tsukune, a tender ground chicken meatball brushed with teriyaki and dipped in raw egg.",0,0
496,Lucky Luna,Fusion,1,"There's no other restaurant around like Lucky Luna. Seriously. Their delicious menu is a hybrid of Taiwanese and Mexican cuisine. The pizzazz on the plate is served in a simple yet tidy assemblage of glossy black tables, and an ambitious beverage program makes the small bar a total draw. Mom's sweet-and-sour cucumber salad, flavored with ginger and garlic, is a bracing start for Peking duck confit bao spread with hoisin mayonnaise, garnished with crispy duck chicharrònes and duck fat popcorn dusted with Chinese five spice. Another hit: the taco of ""reverse"" carnitas is a pile of succulent pork shoulder that's been seared then braised in a broth of beer, oranges, and tomatoes, and finally topped with crunchy bits of radish and spicy pickles.",0,0
497,Sushi Katsuei,Japanese,2,"Park Slope's serious sushi den is the kind of place where the itamae will adamantly decline requests for soy sauce. But rest assured it comes from a place of love, because that beautiful piece of nigiri has already been brushed with soy sauce, sprinkled with yuzu and sea salt, or dabbed with yuzu kosho. In other words, it's fantastic as is. A handful of straightforward cooked items like free-range chicken teriyaki or tempura udon are great if the kids are in tow, but the real focus is sushi best enjoyed in an omakase that won't break the bank. Be sure to choose the option that includes sashimi and begin this repast with velvety slices of medium fatty tuna and sparkling sea bass, followed by a maki of mackerel, slivered cucumber and pickled ginger.",0,0
498,Do or Dine,Contemporary,2,"Under a yellow awning advertising Caribbean takeout lies Do or Dine, a groovy, psychedelic trip into fine dining under a disco ball. Teacups serve as lampshades next to graffiti art in this hodgepodge chic, Bed-Stuy restaurant, started by four chef-friends who wanted more for this neighborhood. Leave inhibitions behind when digging into the Nippon nachos, a cross of Japanese and Tex-Mex that tops crisp gyoza with cheddar cheese, pico de gallo, and masago-infused sour cream. ""You've got quail"" and truffle polenta primes you for more cheeky dishes, such as habanero chicken and ""woffals"" (waffles enriched with chicken liver) or a deep-fried foie gras doughnut. Get ""drank"" at the bustling bar with George and Gingers, the signature Bourbon mule.",0,0
499,Bobby Van's,American,4,"Nestled at the base of The Helmsley building near Grand Central lies Bobby Van's, a perennial favorite of the expense-account set. Its classic steakhouse atmosphere-gruff but prompt service, noisy post-work bar scene, and gargantuan portions-is met with commendable dishes that reach beyond the normal chop shop fare. While the beef speaks for itself, the kitchen's execution takes common combos to the next level: mozzarella and tomatoes are drizzled in flavorful balsamic and olive oil with a chiffonade of basil and shallots; while soft-shell crabs arrive perfectly battered and tempura fried. This massive special, with crisp asparagus and bed of sautéed spinach, showcases great culinary technique and seasonality not expected from a midtown lunch hangout.",0,0
500,Mesa Coyoacán,Mexican,2,"Mexico City native, Chef Ivan Garcia has settled into this Brooklyn hot spot, where wolfish appetites are sated with richly flavored fare. Fronted by windows that open up to bustling Graham Avenue, the long space is outfitted with patterned wallpaper, snug banquettes, and communal tables. The kitchen's spirited cooking is simply a joy. Partake in tacos featuring hand-crafted tortillas, like the suadero stuffed with beef brisket and avocado salsa; or torta tinga de pollo, packed with shredded chipotle-braised chicken, mashed black beans, pickled jalapeños, and a toasted roll to sop up that delish sauce. Reposado and diced mango enhances the pastel tres leches-and to keep the tequila flowing, hit up nearby Zona Rosa, Chef Garcia's latest venture.",0,0
501,Esca,Seafood,3,"Chef David Pasternack's Italian-style seafood has kept this Theater District mainstay hopping for fifteen years now. The two-room space is cozy and boasts a rustic charm with its lemon-yellow walls and displayed wine storage. The steady kitchen turns out consistently impressive cuisine that starts off with a listing of crudo, such as petals of pale pink seabream simply but impeccably dressed with Meyer lemon-infused olive oil, Amagansett sea salt, and black pepper. Other plates reveal seared monkfish liver, custard-soft within, served atop radicchio, organic grains, and candied citrus. The house-made bucatini with Rita's spicy octopus sauce is deliciously zesty. Dessert may highlight a semolina pudding with caramel sauce and vanilla yogurt.",0,0
502,Vitae,Contemporary,3,"Ordering an Old Fashioned at lunchtime is fraught with all sorts of social implications so praise be to restaurants like Vitae, which are grown up enough to ensure that no eyebrows are raised when someone decides they want lunch the old fashioned way. This is a sophisticated and elegant midtown restaurant with an appealing self-confidence. Even the soundtrack appears to have been chosen by someone who actually knows what good music sounds like. Service is snappy, assured, and well-organised. The menu is contemporary without being faddish. Flavor combinations, such as the sesame salmon with soy, are recognizable and complementary and dishes pass that most basic of tests: they are very easy to eat. And those cocktails are pretty good too.",0,0
503,Patroon,American,4,"For those in the know, this elegant canteen needs no introduction. Patroon exudes the air of a private club-one where suited professionals huddle over drinks at the sleek bar; and dining rooms fill with power lunchers who smoke cigars on the rooftop. That this restaurant draws a devoted crowd of regulars should come as no surprise; the maître d' and his gracious servers are top-notch and the kitchen team is highly competent. Come dinnertime, the classic cooking is especially impressive: bracing ceviche may feature Long Island fluke; then Dover sole is plated tableside; and light yet satisfying leek gratin caters to diners who would rather invest the calories elsewhere-say a fine pour from the well-curated wine list or a perfect crème brulée for dessert.",0,0
504,Alcala,Spanish,3,"This cozy Spanish eatery is a stone's throw from the United Nations, drawing a lively evening mix of sophisticated international clientele and neighborhood regulars. With its buttery yellow walls and homey little bar stocked with delicious Spanish wines, Alcala might remind you of an old Spanish finca, but at heart its also one of those old school New York haunts, where the waiters and cooks have been in place forever and you wouldn't dream of kicking your meal off without a drink. The dishes are delicious, well-prepared, and ample. Try the sardinas a la parrilla, laced with hot pimiento oil; fresh, grilled branzino in a bright tomato coulis; or the tarta de aresse, a rich custard pie with mouthwatering crème anglaise and strawberry coulis.",0,0
505,Tulsi,Indian,2,"Anyone who loves their Indian food but got jaded by the generic ghee-heavy menus of Curry Hill should head along to Tulsi. In place of the seizure-inducing colored lighting, this midtown favorite offers billowing muslin and neutral tones; and instead of the usual Bollywood clichés, it provides tranquil, sophisticated surroundings, and attentive, sweet natured service. The menu is also markedly different from the norm. For the appetizers, the kitchen takes the sort of snacks you can find streetside on Chaupati and, by putting its own spin on them (and using primary ingredients), raises them to new heights-such as with the white beans of ragda chaat, which is a great way to start your meal. You can also go Goan for some Portuguese influence with the succulent shrimp balchao. But, be sure to leave room for authentic goat biryani served on the bone, or something from the tandoor like those tender lamb chops. As a nod to local tastes, spicing can be a little timid but those who are familiar with India-and anyone who knows their silly mid-on from their backward point-will still find much to savor.",1,1
506,Selamat Pagi,Indonesian,1,"This curious little café in the far reaches of Greenpoint is owned by the folks behind Van Leeuwen artisanal ice cream. The whitewashed room has limited seating between the wood plank banquette and metal chairs. Dining here is utterly charming, unique, and cheap. Selamat Pagi means ""good morning"" in Balinese and it greets the 'hood with brunch on the weekend. The concise menu of fragrant and flavorful cooking keeps people coming back for luscious compositions like nasi campur-chopped long bean lawar dressed in lime juice, galangal, and toasted coconut, served with prawn crackers plus shaved red chili. A Bali fish salad seasoned with turmeric and shallot is yet another favored treat. And for dessert, choose a scoop of sticky black rice or lemongrass ice cream.",0,0
507,Utsav,Indian,2,"Meaning ""festival"" in Sanskrit, Utsav is an upscale hideaway perched on a suspended corridor between two office buildings. The ground floor features a bar and small plaza with outdoor seating, while the upstairs dining room is swathed in gold fabric and spacious with floor-to-ceiling windows. Orchid-topped tables look even prettier once the food arrives. The wallet-friendly and over-flowing lunch buffet brings office workers in by droves, while the early evening prix-fixe is popular with the pre-theater crowd. Delights include tandoori chicken kali mirch liberally seasoned with crushed black pepper, as well as Hyderabadi shrimp curry with a bright red tamarind and chili sauce so tasty it begs to be sopped up by hot wedges of aloo paratha.",0,0
508,Kurumazushi,Japanese,4,"Mimicking Tokyo's tucked-away restaurant style, this sushi destination is located up a dark staircase in a midtown building and through a sliding door. The focal point of the room is the sushi bar, where Chef/owner Toshihiro Uezu meticulously prepares each morsel in a minimal space. For the full theatrical experience, brace your wallet and settle into the omakase. The undeniable quality of each ingredient is center stage, displayed simply on stone glazed pottery. Take a cue from the Japanese and limit conversation: the succession of sashimi and sushi is quick, and all senses should work together without distraction to savor the smooth, buttery fatty tuna, Spanish mackerel (with its lightly blistered skin), pearly white sea bream, and rich unagi.",0,0
509,Tsushima,Japanese,2,"A shiny black awning marks the entrance to this slightly antiseptic yet considerably authentic sushi bar. A few rooms done in traditional Japanese style provide seating choices at this den, which hums with business groups on the run as well as neighborhood dwellers seeking fantastic value lunches and terrific quality sushi in the evening. Choose to dine at their sushi counter or at a table in the well-lit dining room, attended to by speedy servers. Then, dive into generously sized lunch specials featuring perhaps a colorful chirashi, headlining yellowtail, salmon, tamago, and amberjack set deftly over well-seasoned sushi rice. Sticky-glazed eel, nicely grilled and plenty fatty, is an absolute must as is the impressive omakase for dinner.",0,0
510,44 & X Hell's Kitchen,American,2,"The moniker is a mouthful, but this modern bistro's endearing appeal has attracted eclectic crowds since opening on a block west of no-man's land. Today, this corner of Hell's Kitchen is a solid, mature venue that offers plenty of reason to swing by. Cute servers in black t-shirts are gracious and attentive, presenting updated renditions of spirited comfort food. Lobster tacos with charred tomato salsa, crunchy buttermilk fried chicken accompanied by a chive waffle and maple syrup jus, as well as pan-roasted mahi mahi with lobster and scallop risotto emerge from the skilled kitchen. House-baked apple pie was a lovely sweet special to ward off the chill of an autumn evening. Sister spot 44 ½ boasts a menu of Asian and Mediterranean influences.",0,0
511,Barbetta,Italian,3,"It doesn't get more old-world New York than this iconic Restaurant Row institution. Opened in 1906, Barbetta is a testament to proper dining out: men are required to don dinner jackets, outerwear is mandatorily checked, and a brigade of starched servers flit about the hushed and gilded surrounds. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the impossibly romantic patio has been the backdrop for countless marriage proposals. The kitchen's Northern-influenced specialties are listed on thick cardstock, and each selection is highlighted by the year of its addition to the menu. Linguine with pesto alla Genovese is as scrumptious today as it was in 1914; while luscious rabbit alla Piemontese, dating back to the Clinton era and braised in white wine and lemon, is equally divine.",0,0
512,Scarlatto,Italian,2,"Dip down below street level to find a lovely exposed brick interior displaying rows of wine bottles and glass beaded wall sconces to match the sparkly tiara crowning Audrey Hepburn in a framed still from Roman Holiday. The menu doesn't offer many surprises but this is cooking that-just like a little black dress-never goes out of style. Among the array, search out polpette al pomodoro, house-made meatballs in a tomato ragù, or bean soup with fresh pasta. Their pollo Parmigiana is a ""red sauce"" classic, made with breaded and fried chicken breast draped in a bright tomato sugo beneath a bounty of grated and caramelized parmesan, served atop a mound of al dente spaghetti. Theater-goers take note: a prix-fixe dinner is offered throughout the evening.",0,0
513,Becco,Italian,2,"This Restaurant Row stalwart has no shortage of competition, but remains unrivaled when it comes to pleasing diners and theater-goers with reliable and hearty Italian fare. This is all thanks to culinary authority Lidia Bastianich, her impresario son Joe, and longtime Executive Chef William Gallagher. Becco's pleasing vision of Italian cuisine includes house-made mozzarella en carozza sandwiched between fried bread with pesto and tomato sauces; and Belgian-ale roasted pulled pork with salsa verde. The sarma (Croatian for stuffed cabbage) honors the family's Istrian heritage with meat-stuffed cabbage in tomato sauce over pan-fried spinach spaetzle. The wine list features bottles priced at $29, with selections from their own highly regarded label.",0,0
514,Hatsuhana,Japanese,3,"It's been around since the beginning of time (in NYC Japanese restaurant years) but this is no lesser a destination for excellent sushi. With a retro décor that spans two floors and a business that's run like a machine, Hatsuhana is a go-to for corporate dining. Though the rave reviews came decades ago, their traditional Edomae sushi still holds its own. Fish is top quality, the army of chefs have solid knife skills, and rice is properly prepared. This reliability draws a host of regulars who develop relationships with the itamae. Stick to the counter and go omakase: the sushi will be surprisingly impressive with accommodations for the spicy tuna-set. Table service can be bumbling with reduced quality, but there is the menu of cooked items on offer to cool frustrations.",0,0
515,Hell's Kitchen,Mexican,2,"Effortlessly cozy and always friendly, Hell's Kitchen is loved for its bold, satisfying meals. Bare-wood tables, exposed bricks, and chandeliers cleverly made of wine bottles enhance the undeniably jovial space. An orange-tiled bar, wall of banquettes, and spacious booths ensure seating for any size group. Start with a martini glass filled with slices of tender raw steak ceviche in limey marinade with red onion, tomato, and chopped cilantro, served with ancho chili-dusted house chips. Then, move on to the agave-marinated pork loin, moist and glistening over a mound of buttery white rice and grilled vegetables-though the star of that dish (and many others) is the rust-colored mole. Sauces here are flavor-forward, incredibly complex, and a clear highlight.",0,0
516,Del Frisco's,Steakhouse,3,"Prime, aged, corn-fed beef is the main attraction at this sprawling, outrageously successful outpost of the Dallas-based steakhouse chain. Portions range from the petite filet to a 24-ounce Porterhouse that will make any Texan proud. The menu begins with a suitably rich feast of cheesesteak egg rolls or white clam flatbread; but then does an about face with a knife-and-fork Caesar salad. Lunch is an affordable way to sample their classics. Complementing its McGraw-Hill Building home, Del Frisco's flaunts a masculine look with a large L-shaped bar, dramatic wrought-iron balcony, wood accents, and towering windows. The mezzanine dining area, accessible by a sweeping staircase, enjoys a quieter ambience. Del Frisco's Grille in Rockefeller Plaza is another option.",0,0
517,Oceana,Seafood,3,"A more apposite name would be hard to imagine and that's not just because this restaurant serves the bounty of the sea; it also stretches out as far as the eye can see. Get a table in the far corner and you may feel you've sailed to distant shores, while the sheer scale of the room may leave you feeling mildly Lilliputian. Come during the day and you'll witness Corporate America at lunch-and they clearly appreciate the efficiency with which it's run. The menu offers enough choice to satisfy the most demanding of sea dogs: there are oysters and lobsters, classics and more contemporary offerings; there are dishes for two like salt-baked mackerel or paella and, for those who fancy themselves as hunter-gatherers, whole fish.",0,0
518,Pampano,Mexican,3,"Nothing screams you need a trip to Acapulco like a stressful day in midtown, and we've got your remedy. Pampano, a popular Mexican seafood restaurant, offers two types of oases for the weary worker: downstairs, you'll find a lively bar (especially come happy hour) with a few small tables to enjoy their botanas menu; upstairs, you'll find a transporting, beachy dining space with whitewashed ceilings, wicker chairs, lazy ceiling fans, and an outdoor patio. Don't miss the fresh guacamole; excellent rotating list of ceviches, plump with off-the-boat fish and humming with bright lime; or grilled grouper, marinated in achiote and wrapped in banana leaf. Next door, Pampano Taqueria keeps the hungry lunch crowds at bay with delicious tacos on the fly.",0,0
519,Casa Enríque,Mexican,2,"Chiapas. Puebla. San Luis Potosí. One can literally taste the regions and cities that Chef Cosme Aguilar's amazingly complex menu explores-including his own childhood recipes to honor his mother's memory. A steady stream of hungry diners seeks out this rather small, tasteful dining room for friendly yet professional service and soul-warming fare. Aim for the large, fantastic communal table. Start your meal with hearty rajas con crema, combining none-too-spicy poblanos with sweet, fresh corn, Mexican sour cream, and cheese served alongside a stack of fresh and slightly toasty tortillas. This kitchen's tender chicken enchiladas with mole de Piaxtala may induce swooning, thanks to a sauce that is unexpectedly sweet yet heady with bitter chocolate, raisins, almonds, cloves, cinnamon, chilies, garlic, sesame, and so much more, with incomparable results. It's the kind of food that thrills palates (and tempts wanton thoughts). Expect the chamarros de borrego al huaxamole to arrive falling off the bone and redolent of epazote, allspice, and pulla chilies. Its fruity-spicy broth is drinkable. Every bit of every spongy and buttery layer of the cow and goat's milk pastel tres leches is absolutely worth the indulgence.",1,1
520,Smith & Wollensky,Steakhouse,4,"Sitting proudly on the corner of Third Avenue for nearly 40 years, Smith & Wollensky is a veritable New York institution. This is the kind of clubby steakhouse where stellar martinis are still poured tableside and the regulars get their names engraved on a plaque. It's where business deals go down and old-time Manhattanites live it up. Begin with beloved classics, including a beefsteak tomato-and-onion salad finished with house dressing and crumbled blue cheese; or spoon-licking sides like creamed spinach, crispy hash browns, and crunchy onion rings. Then, allow the adept servers to steer you towards the in-house favorite-namely, a beautifully marbled, deliciously fatty, and perfectly tender Colorado rib steak, bone-on and big enough for three.",0,0
521,The Sea Grill,Seafood,3,"This seafood-centric grill looks onto the iconic Rockefeller Center ice-skating rink and is framed by a wall of windows. Inside, find a cool aqua-accented space that inspires dressing up. Yes, tourists flock here after a spin on the ice, but it is also popular among business crowds-especially at lunch when the bar is bustling with sharp suits munching on lobster tail with a martini on the side. The food itself is light and fresh. In-season you may find soft-shelled crab, served alongside a seaweed salad with citrus-marinated hearts of palm. The Northeast supplies many local seafood choices, such as the Block Island golden snapper a la plancha, with tangy cherry-tomato vinaigrette. Dependable and familiar classics like jumbo lump crab cakes are also on offer.",0,0
522,La Masseria,Italian,2,"Stone, stucco walls, and exposed wood beams warm this bright and popular Theater District standby. The convenient location ensures that every large white-clothed table in the dining room is routinely full, and spot-on service delivered by smartly attired team keeps the mood upbeat. When it comes to the food, the menu chooses homey Italian comforts over theatrics. Homemade stuffed fresh mozzarella allows the character of each ingredient-peppery arugula, roasted eggplant-to shine. Don't miss a selection of pasta fatta in casa. Entrées include a tender, juicy, expertly pounded veal chop with wedges of crisply roasted potatoes and a zippy chopped tomato and black olive salad. Finish with a warm and buttery inverted apple tart topped by vanilla ice cream.",0,0
523,Bukhara Grill,Indian,3,"In NYC's ever-expanding realm of Indian dining, Bukhara Grill has stood the test of time with excellence. Glimpse their expert chefs who seem contentedly trapped behind a glass kitchen wall. Featuring a noisy and yuppie set, this tri-level space is decorated (albeit oddly) with clunky wooden booths, closely set tables, and private rooms. Peek into the kitchen for a whiff of tandoori treats and Mughlai specialties. Dahi aloo papri or spicy potatoes and chickpeas tossed in yogurt and tamarind is a predictably perfect starter. The signature, wickedly creamy dal Bukhara will have you coming back for more (tomorrow). Even if the service may range from sweet to clumsy, hand-crafted breads meant to sop up the likes of sarson ka saag remain a crowning glory.",0,0
524,Sake Bar Hagi,Japanese,1,"This basement izakaya can be a challenge to locate-its name is slyly marked on a door that opens to a flight of stairs. Descend to find an unremarkable, brightly lit, and boisterous room tightly packed with wood furnishings and a strong Japanese following. The space may be small but the menu is vast, so bring friends to ensure a fulfilling experience. Their spot-on small plates are designed to be washed down by beer, sake, or distinctly Japanese cocktails like cassis with oolong tea or soda, or a Calpico sour. Be sure to include wasabi-spiked shu mai stuffed with ground pork; or takoyaki, deep-fried octopus croquettes with daikon and grated ginger root. Spicy cod roe fried rice and grilled hamachi collar with a light squeeze of lemon are other standouts.",0,0
525,Sip Sak,Turkish,2,"The celadon façade of this tiny Turkish treasure with its frosted glass awning and art nouveau look holds its own in mundane midtown. Walls lined with large mirrors and a shiny pressed-tin ceiling stand over an armada of cool white marble-topped tables and bentwood bistro chairs. The décor seems French, but the cuisine leads to the Eastern Mediterranean with a definite stop in Turkey. A central, fully stocked bar serves as the launching point for Chef Orhan Yegen, who can be seen (and heard) directing his staff as they entice diners with a meze of citrusy olives, delicious hummus, garlicky cacik, and creamy tarama. House specials like rustic braised lamb chunks set atop a smooth eggplant purée seem straightforward but are deeply comforting.",0,0
526,Añejo,Mexican,2,"This tasty cocina set in Hell's Kitchen is unpretentious and intimate. The house is always full and crowds are convivial, especially while sipping one of Añejo's beloved cocktails. The namesake margarita is an upscale, top-shelf refresher made with fresh lime juice and agave nectar that pairs perfectly with just about anything from the kitchen. Ceviche, small plates, and tacos are all to be enjoyed with gusto. Start with the guacamole trio featuring traditional, pineapple-chipotle, and tomatillo-charred poblano variations. Then move on to a warm mushroom salad with wilted watercress, brown butter, and Berkshire pork chorizo. Pumpkin tamale is an outstanding deconstructed square of smashed kabocha squash, lamb barbacoa, and crema inside a banana leaf.",0,0
527,Limani,Greek,3,"Rockefeller Center's splashy new canteen has quickly positioned itself as a top contender for formal Greek dining. The ethereal space is all gleaming white surfaces and colorful mood lighting; whole fish are displayed on ice, and an onyx reflecting pool sits in the center of it all. Limani's dressed-up crowd nibbles on contemporary Hellenic delights executed with aplomb. The raw bar offers icy treats-oysters, sashimi, and ceviche-and globally sourced catch is the foundation of cooked preparations, like grilled Canadian halibut dressed with olive oil and capers. Gigantes cooked in a tomato sauce redolent of dill and anise are a worthy side dish; while karidopita, spiced walnut cake soaked with honey, makes for a sweet Greek finish.",0,0
528,Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen,Chinese,1,"With its lineup of traditionally prepared comfort food, this steamy joint kicks Hell's Kitchen's Chinese competitors to the curb. Set among the bright lights of the Theater District yet more indicative of the noodle houses found south of Canal Street or along Flushing Avenue, the perpetually packed gem offers a so-so ambience but very friendly service. Hand-pulled and hand-cut noodles are stir-fried with a number of mouthwatering accompaniments; while the dumpling variety is so great it's almost impossible to focus. Herb-spiked pork and shrimp wonton soup is well worth the 20-minute wait, allowing diners plenty of time to devour pan-fried Peking duck bundles and scallion pancakes stuffed with sliced beef; or steamed buns full of mushroom and bok choy.",0,0
529,Talde,Asian,2,"This corner of Park Slope is the domain of Chef Dale Talde, whose forte for cooking creative pan-Asian delights at glitzy hot spots has been astutely translated. Carved woodwork and figurines define this sexy venue that, by virtue of its location, is also family-friendly. His menu invokes the flavors of China, Japan, Thailand, Korea, as well as the Philippines. Wonton noodle soup is not to be missed: pork-and-chive dumplings poached in a rich, cloudy broth stocked with springy noodles, tender pork shoulder, wilted greens, and a six-minute egg. Miso-marinated salmon is plated with puffed bulgur, pickled plums, and salsa verde; while local corn is tossed with long beans and lemongrass-Kaffir lime butter for a light yet delightful bite.",0,0
530,Applewood,American,2,"A rustic counterpoint to the common hip Brooklyn restaurant, find Applewood in a quaint corner townhouse with wrought-iron fencing, box planters, and wooden park benches out front. The inside may appear cramped at first, but perception shifts once seated as the fireplace, exposed brick walls, pressed-tin ceiling, and shelves lined with books work their cozy magic. Dishes are layered with flavor, including chewy herb spaetzle and wilted greens topped with grilled lamb sausage and mustard seeds. Pickled red cabbage tops a pork chop sliced off the bone, with a light yet delish potato gratin on the side. High-minded desserts may include a warm carrot cake with fragrant cardamom syrup. A reasonably priced three-course prix-fixe turns locals into regulars.",0,0
531,Brasserie Ruhlmann,French,3,"True, some New Yorkers may think of this place as kind of touristy, but this is quintessential brasserie cooking in an equally quintessential Manhattan setting at the base of Rockefeller Center, overlooking its plaza. There is little debate that this French bijou offers some of the best people-watching around. The décor pays homage to its art deco namesake, Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann, through edgy lines and geometric prints. Some dishes may be on the menu more for pleasing the crowds than reflecting tradition (hence the sushi rolls). Still, the croque monsieur is everything you dream it to be-impossibly rich with paper-thin and salty jambon de Paris, creamy béchamel, and a dangerously good layering of melted Gruyère over thick slices of brioche.",0,0
532,Crave Fishbar,Seafood,2,"Just like the raucous bars that populate the neighborhood, this spot is filled to the brim with an exuberant crowd. However this coveted fish bar's sophisticated following aren't interested in bottomless pitchers of beer; they're here to dive into Chef Todd Mitgang's skillfully rendered seafood preparations. Local sea scallops are presented raw and chopped atop slices of roasted sweet potato and dressed with spicy mayonnaise, nori powder, and crumbled house-made oyster crackers. Meanwhile, John Dory has an Indian accent-marinated in spiced yogurt, then roasted and plated with a chana masala of green garbanzo beans. Chow down at the 25-foot marble bar, or head to the back room-a pretty clash of reclaimed timber, floral wallpaper, and plaid upholstery.",0,0
533,SushiAnn,Japanese,2,"Step through the serene, bamboo-filled entrance and into this dedicated sushi den. The mood is respectfully formal yet friendly, thanks to the focused kitchen staff who are happily interacting with guests. Just arrive with a sense of what (and how much) you'd like to eat and insist upon omakase. Let the day's catch dictate your meal and take a seat at the counter, where only the glassed-in display of fish and mollusks separates you from this team of skilled, disciplined chefs. The omakase may be wildly varied depending on the day (and your chef), but high standards are always maintained and each crunchy morsel is treated with integrity. A ceramic dish of sashimi may reveal a glistening array of mild giant clam, firm tai, and tuna that melts in the mouth.",0,0
534,Amma,Indian,2,"Vibrant family-style South Asian cooking is appropriately set within this former townhouse, as amma is the word for mother in several South Indian languages. And manners are a must, as this ""home"" is adjacent to the UN, and service is attentively buttoned-up. Find generously-portioned options from both the north and south subcontinent. Street snack Bombay bhel puri is colorfully seasoned with tamarind water and mango powder-laced chaat masala. Hard-to-find menu items such as bagharey baingan or eggplants simmered in a thick, rich peanut curry, make you feel like you've been let in on a little secret and invited to the neighbor's party. Pistachio kulfi is a satisfyingly sweet, cardamom-spiced finale which makes another neighborly visit inevitable.",0,0
535,Don Antonio by Starita,Pizza,2,"Hell's Kitchen's best pizzeria boasts serious street cred. The namesake original in Naples has been in operation since 1901, while this outpost is run by pizza maestros, Antonio Starita and Roberto Caporuscio. Always busy, the setting features a red-tiled domed pizza oven and walls lined with art depicting volcanoes-this calls to mind the logo of Caporuscio's other pizza hot spot, Kesté. The lightly fried, wood-fire finished montanara Starita is a house specialty. An array of other fried and filled pies feature a first-rate listing of pizze rosse, pizze bianchi, and even gluten-free options. The speciale has included the Guiseppe spread with earthy artichoke purée beneath gobs of melted house-made mozzarella, and drizzles of olive oil.",0,0
536,Toloache,Mexican,2,"This first location of midtown's Mexican hot spot (with outposts in SoHo and the Upper East Side) remains immensely popular for ample reason. An extensive selection of tequilas flow freely from the spirited bar, chunky guacamole is endlessly mashed from mounds of ripe avocados, and antojitos emerge from the brick oven in this two-story dining room decked with Talavera tiles, wood-beam ceilings, and stunning copper lanterns. Toloache puts a contemporary spin on each of its zesty dishes. Tacos begin with tender, excellent masa tortillas amply stuffed with beer-braised beef brisket (suadero), tomatillo salsa, and horseradish crema. The signature camarones Toloache showcase a handful of large, fresh shrimp draped with a vibrant dried cascabel salsa.",0,0
537,Aldo Sohm Wine Bar,Contemporary,2,"Step through this buffed metal doorway to find an oenophile's fantasy where Zalto stemware is stacked high and each polished glass is ready to be filled by one of the 200 selections brilliantly curated by Le Bernardin's super-star sommelier, Aldo Sohm. Over 40 wines on the list are offered by the glass. A tailored crowd sits and sips-perhaps on an oversized U-shaped sofa, a comfy counter, or handful of tall tables. The scene is luxe but also comfortable, featuring crystal fixtures, vivid artwork, and a stylish array of bric-a-brac stacked high to the soaring ceiling. Tapas-sized snacks are designed for sharing with wine consumption in mind and include a plate of cheeses, charcuterie, harissa-roasted carrots, or chicken drumstick prepared coq au vin-style.",0,0
538,Le Relais de Venise (L'Entrecôte),Steakhouse,2,"Sibling to the Paris original, this midtown outpost boasts a prime location and exceptional value. Inside, it's no amateur show and there's just one menu option-but what an impressive one it is. Start with green salad tossed in a light mustard vinaigrette before slicing into a juicy steak, dressed with the kitchen's mouthwatering (and top secret!) sauce. Of course, it is only upon the arrival of salty, crunchy frites when your meal will truly start to sing. Desserts aren't a highlight; so opt instead for another glass of vin from their judicious and vast list. The décor is classic and the staff, dressed in sassy outfits, are the very image of Paris-chic. So sit back, relax, and take it all in-and find that for a moment, you'd forgotten you were in Manhattan.",0,0
539,Café Steinhof,Austrian,1,"Austrian flavors abound at this eccentric Park Slope café. The space is anchored by a large, wooden bar where a selection of beers on draught, generously measured libations, and fruit brandies are poured. Vintage posters hang on the walls and oldies play nostalgically in the background. Sturdy wood tables alongside large windows provide a cozy spot to feast on Austrian comfort food. Old-world classics are executed with care; the expertly fried Wiener schnitzel is brightened with a few wedges of lemon and a side of thin, pickled cucumbers. Texture is also nailed in a side of pan-fried, golden-brown spaetzle that showcases chewy, butter-coated noodles. Linzer torte is the final Austrian flourish, satisfying with sour cherry jam and a flaky crust.",0,0
540,Chez Napoléon,French,2,"Oh so popular and family-run by the Brunos since 1982, this atmospheric bijou is not to be missed for its unapologetically creamy and butter-dreamy plates of traditional French cuisine. It's not polite to discuss age, but let's just say that Chef/grandmère, Marguerite Bruno, has steadily commanded this kitchen for an impressive tenure. The scene is magnifique. Take in the creaky wood floors and parchment-colored walls hung with French-themed jigsaw puzzles, then indulge in chilled silky leeks dressed with the famous house vinaigrette; sautéed veal kidneys in mustard-cream sauce; and steak au poivre with black or green peppercorn sauce. Plan ahead when ordering so you have time (and space) for a classic dessert soufflé sided with crème anglaise.",0,0
541,Fonda,Mexican,2,"A lively retreat set in a quiet neighborhood, Fonda is a local darling for creative Mexican food. Tiny tables are tightly packed into the dim room, where blood-red walls, a black ceiling, and paintings hanging over exposed brick create an intimate feel. Metal fans spin overhead and soft Mexican tunes are almost drowned out by animated conversations. Looking for tacos? Go elsewhere. This menu is more nuanced with such appetizing items as duck zarape, a mound of tender, shredded duck between warm, flaky tortillas and blanketed in a roasted tomato-habanero sauce. Pescado en chile atole is equally layered with flavor, featuring ancho-rubbed red snapper over creamy fingerling potatoes and tender poblanos. Outposts also reside in Chelsea and the East Village.",0,0
542,Le Bernardin,Seafood,4,"Eric Ripert's paean to all things piscatorial is unquestionably one of the daddies of the New York dining scene. No one gets to occupy this amount of prime midtown real estate for this long without knowing exactly what they're doing-and doing it supremely well. Run with consummate ease by a well-organized team, its influence stretches beyond merely the entertaining of big-hitters and even bigger spenders. But however celebrated, the sine qua non of any self-respecting seafood restaurant must be the ability to cook a piece of fish absolutely perfectly and, in this, Le Bernardin displays deftness and consistency. Just try the luxuriantly buttery wild striped bass and you'll get the idea. ""Almost Raw,"" ""Barely Touched,"" and ""Lightly Cooked"" are the headings under which you'll find an impressive array of dishes. The influences are global but the cooking is underpinned by a mastery of technique; ingredients are of unimpeachable quality and the kitchen has the confidence to never overcrowd a plate so that the fish always remains the star of the show.",3,1
543,Print,American,2,"Travel to these western hinterlands and breath a whiff of Californian sensibility. Print's home, off the lobby of the Ink48 hotel, has an easy-breezy layout that unites lounging and supping in a space that is pleasantly moody and particularly cozy. The talented team behind this locavore kitchen takes its mission seriously: there is a full time forager on payroll, water is poured into recycled glasses, the kitchen composts, and the menu highlights the provenance of ingredients. Seasonality and simplicity are shown in creations like a wintertime salad of watercress, blood orange, Medjool dates, crushed Marcona almonds, and sherry vinaigrette. During the summer, ride up to the 16th-floor Press lounge for drinks, small plates, and killer views.",0,0
544,Jora,Peruvian,2,"Peruvian pottery and tapestries set a casually elegant scene at this newcomer, which is quickly earning a loyal following for frothy pisco sours and spicy dishes full of fresh flavor. Beyond the pale limestone façade, the deep, narrow dining room is filled with light from arched windows and boasts a wall covered in river stones as well as a relaxed bar with striking artwork. The diversity of Peruvian cuisine is on tasty display here, from classic dishes like ceviche mixto with slices of crunchy red onion, oversized kernels of corn and sweet potato, to chupe de camarones-a thick, restorative soup of rice, seafood, and gently poached eggs. A juicy skirt steak with sautéed onions, peppers, cilantro, and sweet plantains on the side will satisfy carnivores.",0,0
545,Hide-Chan Ramen,Japanese,1,"There is a meticulous science and culture to this ramen-ya that has seemingly perfected the customized noodle experience. Two suggestions to novices: dine during off-hours to avoid their mile-long line; and ponder exactly how firm you like your ramen cooked and rich you like your broth before even stepping afoot. The décor may not say much, but the food speaks volumes in terms of authenticity and flavor. Start with steamed buns of succulent pork or pan-fried gyoza, before moving on to enticing mains centered around unbeatable renditions of ramen. Kuro ramen features an intensely nourishing and garlicky tonkotsu broth bobbing with bits of char siu. Meanwhile, health-conscious NYers are in luck, as both vegetable and chicken broth are also on offer here.",0,0
546,Bar Corvo,Italian,2,"Walk by Bar Corvo and sense the goodness that awaits inside. A pane of glass provides a sneak peek at the large marble bar, communal table, penny-tile flooring, and cheerfully retro décor. Its eclectic vibe and artistic touches lead to a spacious garden, perfect for groups, and a culinary experience that keeps lines spilling onto the sidewalk. Here, a house-made aïoli adds a horseradish kick to sublimely tender beef tongue fries-braised in a chicken stock, tossed in a beer and rice-flour batter, and finally fried to perfection. The savory pesce al forno starts with a base of fingerling potatoes and continues with a lightly breaded fillet of hake, baked with cherry tomatoes, black olives, and finished with garlic and herb salmoriglio.",0,0
547,Alobar,American,2,"This leisurely gastropub radiates old-world appeal through the red brick exterior and dining room adorned with antiques, copper-rimmed architect lamps, and rustic wood tables. From the softly lit, stocked bar to the cozy banquettes, this space has an attention to design that enhances each meal. Most everyone here begins with a selection from the pickled menu-curried apples, mushrooms-perhaps to pair with the house chicken liver or country pâté (sadly, most of the charcuterie is no longer made in-house). From there, the inventive pleasures range from half chicken with roasted sweet yellow corn and chipotle honey to the bacon-chocolate bread pudding oozing with chunks of chocolate, served with salted caramel, crème anglaise, and a satisfying crust.",0,0
548,La Grenouille,French,4,"La Grenouille is a bastion of old-world glamor and manners with an exorbitant budget for floral arrangements. Although this storied enclave still attracts a devoted following, there's always room for local newbies and blinged-out tourists. Everyone looks good in this lavish space, where red velvet banquettes, polished wood veneer, and softly lit tables bathe the room in rose and apricot hues. Classic and classy, this French cuisine deserves high praise. Delicate ravioli is stuffed with chopped lobster hinting of tarragon and dressed with creamy, tart beurre blanc; an exquisitely tender-seared beef filet arrives with pommes Darphin and a lick of perfect sauce au poivre; and for dessert, the île flottante is heaven under a cloud of spun caramel.",0,0
549,The Four Seasons,American,4,"The name alone invokes an image straight out of Mad Men-with beautiful sophisticates and well-dressed men rubbing elbows in a posh, mid-century room with mile-high ceilings, breathtaking flower arrangements, and intimate tables circling a center fountain. In real life, The Four Seasons is all that and more, with a rollicking fun seating chart that's a see-and-be-seen affair; excellent (if no longer particularly groundbreaking) food; an impeccable wait staff; and ultra-glamorous décor. Kick things off with exquisitely fresh steak tartare, expertly prepared tableside. Then move on to tender and flaky Dover sole kissed with Hollandaise; followed by a near-perfect soufflé with Grand Marnier. Speaking of alcohol, go on and order that martini-Don Draper would.",0,0
550,21 Club,American,3,"Fabled 21 Club has been in business for over 85 years, but there's nothing slowing it down. Opened originally as a speakeasy, this New York institution has wined and dined everyone from movie stars and moguls to moneyed city folk. From its lantern-holding jockeys and townhouse exterior, to the leather- and wood-paneled dining room that feels like a step back in time, this is a classic through and through. The menu is a perfect accompaniment to the setting with choices like seared foie gras tinged with mango chutney and spread atop toasted brioche; or a splendid and classic rendition of steak tartare paired with a green salad. Upstairs and in the back, the feel is formal-so for a casual bite with prettier prices, head off the main entrance to Bar 21.",0,0
551,Mu Ramen,Japanese,2,"What began as a pop-up found an insanely popular home behind an unmarked door in this industrial yet residential nook of Long Island City. Lines never cease; arrive early if possible. A thick wood block serves as a communal table in the dining room, where slurpers can witness the focus and dedication of chefs working within an open kitchen in the back. The kitchen's methodical devotion results in a superior bowl of ramen. In the spicy miso ramen, springy noodles (from Sun Noodle) are nested in a red miso and pork based soup of rich bone broth that slowly simmers for over 24 hours. Topped with scallion, ground pork, sesame, and chili oil, it is one of many rewarding bowls. Okonomiyaki are ethereally light, with smoked trout and shaved bonito.",0,0
552,Braai,South African,2,"From its ground floor townhouse home, Braai is adored for tantalizing South African cuisine. Two tables sit up front in a snug patio, which dovetails into a long and slender dark wood space. Drawing inspiration from its region, wide planks make up the floors while the arched ceiling is thatched with straw. Yet the African-inspired décor in the dining room, set with marble-topped communal tables, is anything but cliché. The menu is resplendent with new and balanced flavors that are at once evident in frikkadel, a classic dish of baked meatballs in broth; or calamari drenched in a lovely wine-lemon emulsion. Speaking of mainstays, bunny chow, a street treat of lamb curry ladled into a bread bowl, is a favorite here as well as at nearby sib, Xai Xai.",0,0
553,Russian Samovar,Russian,2,"Which came first: the vodka or the celebs? It's hard to say when it comes to this hot spot, which caters to hockey players, Russian intelligentsia, and vodka aficionados alike. Our bets are on that beautiful vodka selection, available in all kinds of flavors, qualities, and sizes (shot, carafe, or bottle). Nestled into the bustling Theater District, Russian Samovar is both quirky and elegant-with low lighting, glass panels, and musicians tickling the piano and violin. The staff, both attentive and sweet, can walk you through delicious fare like fresh salmon-caviar blini, prepared tableside; pelmeni, tender veal dumplings served with sour cream and honey mustard; or milk-cured Baltic herring, paired with pickled onions, potatoes, and carrots.",0,0
554,Thistle Hill Tavern,American,2,"At this offshoot from the team behind Talde, you can also expect highly creative cooking, but this time the accent is decidedly American. Set along a corner, this is a fine spot for dining alfresco; inside, find a charming assemblage of sports memorabilia and servers flitting around. Locals head to this South Slope tavern to fill up on hearty cooking that hints of the Mediterranean but is best typified by the likes of pulled pork sliders tucked between a bun, stuffed with pickled ramp and spicy mayonnaise; or crunchy fried chicken, drizzled with black pepper country gravy and sided by a cheddar biscuit. Wrap up the contemporary flavors offered here with apple pie. The deep-fried pocket is accompanied by a buttery apple cider sauce and cinnamon gelato.",0,0
555,Gallagher's,Steakhouse,3,"A multi-million dollar renovation hasn't glossed over any of Gallagher's iconic character. Walls covered with photos of horses and jockeys harken back to the 85-year-old stallion's former proximity to the old Madison Square Garden. The menu's ""other soup"" is a sly reference held over from Prohibition days; and diners still walk past the window-fronted meat locker where slabs of USDA Prime beef are dry-aged. Gallagher's fresh sparkle is exhibited by the display kitchen, set behind glass panes. The chefs here turn out contemporary-minded fare like hamachi crudo with a yuzu-jalapeño vinaigrette to go with choice cuts of meat grilled over hickory. The rib steak is a bone-in ribeye that arrives mouthwateringly tender with a side of warm and savory house sauce.",0,0
556,Chevalier,Contemporary,4,"Bearded hipsters are not the target market for every new opening. This glamorous brasserie within the Baccarat Hotel is unashamedly geared to the more grown-up members of the city's social scene-those for whom 53rd Street is downtown. The space exudes old-school charm as the dapper waitstaff coddles those Manhattan powerbrokers and their mink-trimmed cohorts. The menu offers a modern re-working of classic French dishes. The clientele are not the sort to be too concerned by prices but at least one can see where the money goes. The scallops, served with comté and morels, are huge and the veal loin with sweetbreads is not for the fainthearted. And as you would expect from a hotel called Baccarat, the glassware is pretty impressive too.",0,0
557,Java,Indonesian,1,"Java's corner in Park Slope has been an enduring first choice for the exotic eats of Indonesia since 1992. Tiny yet tidy, this dark wood-furnished space is brightened by tall windows covered in golden drapery, native artwork, and the smiles of a friendly staff wearing batik aprons. A nibble from the bevy of fried appetizers is certainly recommended. Begin with bakwan or golden-fried corn fritters, but don't forget about the mouthwatering sate-charred skewers of chicken, beef, or seafood brushed with kecap manis and topped with diced tomato and crispy fried shallots. The array of saucy, simmered options includes sambal goring udang: excellent batter-fried shrimp doused in turmeric-tinted coconut milk infused with lemongrass, ginger, and basil.",0,0
558,Jukai,Japanese,3,"If you can't make it to Tokyo by dinnertime, this subterranean den is the next best thing. Smartly styled in wood and bamboo, it's packed with expats lingering over elaborate meals attended to by an amicable staff. The menu is traditional, though the chef's unique influences are well expressed in a massive oyster ""sashimi"" that's sliced in half on the shell and served with a mirin-soy dip and grated radish. To allow for a wide sampling of their top quality sashimi-from fluke and scallop to uni-opt for the tasting menu, and be sure to request the premium shabu-shabu. Thinly sliced Washu is swished in a bubbling dashi and coupled with noodles, bok choy, tofu, mushrooms, and two drinkable dipping sauces-ponzu as well as a signature sesame shabu-shabu sauce.",0,0
559,Casa Lever,Italian,4,"The modernist design and crowds of corporate denizens give this loud, lively favorite a Mad Men feel. Housed in the basement of the iconic Lever House, this sexy, low-lit space is decked with tufted charcoal bucket seats circling red cocktail tables, wood panels, honeycomb-shaped wine racks, and Warhol-esque artwork. The gracious staff is top-notch. An elegant, Northern Italian menu offers the likes of perfectly roasted, thinly sliced vitello tonnato in that unlikely yet incredibly delicious sauce of tuna, capers, and mayonnaise. Linguine with sea urchin, crab meat, crushed tomato, and peperoncino is generous and beautifully calibrated. To finish, the contemporary millefoglie layers delicate pastry, vanilla Chantilly cream, and raspberry granite.",0,0
560,Danji,Korean,2,"Thanks to tall communal tables that practically fill the dining room, Chef Hooni Kim's Hell's Kitchen hot spot is both festive and bustling. Attractive and smartly designed, its silk panels, pottery, and striking display of spoons are further enhanced by a flattering lighting scheme. Equally impressive are the menu's myriad small plates, each of them a refreshing take on Korean specialties. Blocks of soft tofu are quickly deep-fried and boldly dressed with gochujang and a ginger-scallion vinaigrette. Poached daikon rings accompanied by bok choy, are glazed with a dark and spicy sauce and stacked high for dramatic presentation. Vegetarian highlights include spicy, crispy dumplings filled with tofu, vegetables, and cellophane noodles.",0,0
561,The Modern,Contemporary,4,"It goes without saying that The Modern has one of the city's most prized locations, designed to capture the iconic feel of MoMA in which it is seamlessly housed. Art enthusiasts appreciate these modernist surrounds, which are timeless and particularly glorious. The bar-cum-lounge up front is all buzz, while the dining room's view of the lush sculpture garden lends tranquility that is conducive to intimacy and quiet conversation. Chef Abram Bissell and team have settled in and are truly wowing these fine, globe-trotting patrons with excellent food complete with a palpably unique personality. Meanwhile, service remains well-timed and always warm. Appealing dishes showcase neat, clean flavors and may include roasted cauliflower florets composed with perfectly creamy crab butter, almond-cauliflower purée, and sweet, fleshy crabmeat. Delicate balance and top quality ingredients are at the height of an exceedingly tender lobster ""marinated with truffles"" and served in a luscious sauce with shaved radishes and bright herbs. And, for dessert, rhubarb bread pudding is topped with vanilla mascarpone mousse and a scoop of Greek yogurt sorbet for a bit of flourish and a whole lot of pleasure.",2,1
562,al Bustan,Lebanese,2,"Lebanese specialties are fired up with aplomb at this enticing retreat, where a moneyed Middle Eastern crowd dominates the space along with a stream of locals including diplomats from the UN. Inside, chandeliers hang from a beam-lined ceiling, while neat white leather chairs and glass partitions impart an air of elegance. The expansive menu boasts a slew of meze, house specials, and a knockout dinner prix-fixe. Let the feasting begin with samboussek jibneh, a baked pastry bubbling with salty feta and crisp fattoush, tossing crunchy romaine lettuce, cucumber, tomato, and sumac. And that's not all: add on the hugely flavored sujuk-spicy beef sausage-sautéed, sliced, and kissed with lemon for that perfect smack of flavor.",0,0
563,Remi,Italian,2,"This well-orchestrated production delights every sense. Designed by Adam Tihany, Remi's slim interior captivates with inlaid wood floors, a striped banquette evoking a gondolier's shirt, Venetian mural, and trio of blown glass chandeliers. A glass wall overlooks a courtyard where seating is offered in warmer weather. The lengthy menu of Northern Italian specialties is perfectly at home, starting with carciofi alla Veneziana-roasted baby artichoke hearts atop a vibrant herb purée, garnished with pitted black olives, roasted garlic cloves, and pecorino. Then, move on to beautifully served tortelli di zucca stuffed with roasted squash and mostarda alla Mantovana, dressed with drizzles of browned butter, grated cheese, and fried sage.",0,0
564,Nerai,Greek,3,"Nerai endeavors to transport diners to Santorini, creating a stark contrast to its rather stiff midtown surrounds. A resort-chic vibe echoes through the whitewashed walls, sea-blue accents, and lots of cool marble. But the holiday ends there, as this crowd is all about business-especially at lunch. The fresh, light cuisine begins with beautifully prepared starters like tender, enticingly charred octopus atop chickpeas, roasted pepper, and quick-pickled onions drizzled with lemon and olive oil. Grilled sea bass is a flawless shade of white, salty and crisp-skinned alongside seasonal vegetables like zucchini and buttery pea purée. Finish with the lovely portokalopita topped with a scoop of bittersweet chocolate sorbet boldly flavored with orange.",0,0
565,Il Gattopardo,Italian,3,"This leopard's take on Italian dining favors elegance over rusticity. Set within two Beaux Arts townhouses (once home to a Rockefeller family member), the restaurant is an understated sprawl of ivory walls contrasting dark-stained floors and smoky mirrors. The smartly attired staff attends to a buttoned-up crowd digging into pricey but pleasing fare like shaved artichoke salad with organic frisée, lemon, olive oil, and bottarga di muggine. Here, veal scaloppini is a pounded filet layered with grilled eggplant and smoked provolone, alongside braised escarole studded with black olives. Like everything else at Il Gattopardo, the cassata Siciliana-with its candied fruit and bright green almond paste-is a dressed-up take on the classic.",0,0
566,Mozzarella & Vino,Italian,2,"Spoiler alert: as the moniker of this midtown treasure implies, the star of the show here is mozzarella di bufala. Bring your appetite to the pretty, narrow space, which features whitewashed brick and taupe walls lined with mirrors and brown leather banquettes, and attempt to choose a version (there are many) of the milky cheese. Can't decide? Our favorites saw it rolled with grilled sweet peppers hinting of anchovies and presented sliced over arugula; as well as diced and stuffed into a trio of golden-brown, crumb-coated arancini filled with sweet pea-studded creamy rice. A salad of avocado and shaved fennel with citrus segments and fresh mint is a refreshing starter, and the short list of entrées indulges with a hearty, oven-baked pasta of the day.",0,0
567,Casellula,American,2,"Casellula oozes with warmth in both look and feel. Dark wood tables, exposed brick, and flickering votives are a sight for sore eyes, while the delightful staff is so attentive and friendly, that you may never want to leave. Small plates are big here, while medium plates feature tasty sandwiches (crunchy muffulettas stuffed with fontina and cured meats) and shrimp tacos splashed with salsa verde. Pity the lactose intolerant, as cheese (and lots of it) followed by dessert (maybe a pumpkin ice cream ""sandwich"" pecked with brown butter caramel?) are part and parcel of the special experience at this petite place. Feeling blue? They've got that and much more with over 50 different varieties, perfectly complemented by an excellent and vast wine list.",0,0
568,Caviar Russe,Contemporary,4,"No playful pun, no name-check for grandma, no oblique reference to a geographical landmark-whoever christened this restaurant clearly wanted to attract a certain type of customer. This is not the place when you should order by pointing vaguely at the menu-that way lies trouble because you may find yourself having to re-mortgage your apartment to pay for the 250 grams of Oscetra caviar you've just inadvertently requested. Best leave that section of the carte to the oligarchs and retired dictators and concentrate on the main menu. Here you will find contemporary dishes of surprising delicacy and precision, with a pleasing bias towards wonderful seafood and shellfish, such as scallops with ricotta gnudi, or delicious bluefin tuna with uni and asparagus. You get buzzed in at street level, which adds a bit of mystery to proceedings. Up the stairs and you'll find yourself in a lavish little jewel box, with colorful murals on the wall, Murano chandeliers hanging from an ornate ceiling, and semi-circular booths. The only thing missing is James Bond's nemesis drumming his fingers on the table in the corner.",1,1
569,Mayfield,American,2,"Managing to be rustic yet hip, and dark yet welcoming, this Crown Heights hideaway has won the hearts of nouveau locals with its feel-good soundtrack and crave-worthy comfort food. A mix of distressed brick walls and sleek tiles fill the dining room, while brass mermaid door handles give the look a playful edge. Art deco-inspired fixtures hang over the inviting bar. Tasso ham lends a smoky hint of the South to chewy mounds of hand-rolled linguini and tender coins of braised octopus tossed with a chunky puttanesca sauce of tomato, olives, capers, and garlic. Silky, organic chicken liver mousse is served alongside a stack of toasted baguette slices and fennel-apple salad. A pot de crème spiked with chilies is a welcome twist on the classic dessert.",0,0
570,Clement,Contemporary,3,"This particularly elegant bar and dining room is one of the lucky few to call the Peninsula New York home. Created by design firm Yabu Pushelberg, the posh setting includes a series of rooms, each with their own striking touches that sprawl from a thickly carpeted staircase off the lobby. Worth a mention is the book room, with its stacks of bound-linen rag paper, mauve fabrics, and fresh flowers in mercury glasses. So too is the kitchen, whose talented team sends out ambitious preparations like the locally sourced scallop composition pairing carpaccio zested by pink grapefruit and yuzu with seared specimens swiped by sunchoke foam. Another winner is crisp-skinned black bass set beside maitake mushrooms and gussied up tableside with roasted duck broth.",0,0
571,Jubilee,French,2,"Settled into sleek Sutton Place, Jubilee is New York City's very own version of Cheers. Affluent families are in full force here, while friends gather on weeknights to mingle over wine and fine French-Belgian cuisine. The European-inflected nautical décor screams quaint coastal elegance with perpetually packed tables and a bar where everybody knows your name. A silky, saffron-scented fish soup, accompanied by grated Gruyère, a few croûtes, and pot of rouille is deliciously classic and incredibly sumptuous. But before filling up, be sure to sample the sole meuniere-a delicate fish seared perfectly and served with sautéed spinach leaves. If that doesn't sound like the best way to end a long day, their popular crème brûlée offers the ultimate fix.",0,0
572,Benoit,French,2,"In the former home of the venerated La Côte Basque, Alain Ducasse's Benoit brings a hint of fame to this address. The casual bistro is rife with elegance through oak-paneled walls, polished brass, and red velvet seating, all set off by art nouveau lighting fixtures reclaimed from the previous tenants. Peugeot pepper grinders, bread presented in linen sacks, and espresso served in custom-made Pillivuyt cups add to the overall experience. Chef Philippe Bertineau heads the kitchen, bringing a skilled hand to the likes of foie de veau, seared calf's liver paired with potatoes Lyonnaise. Pan-seared monkfish tail is prepared coq au vin-style with red wine sauce, lardons, pearl onions, and sautéed mushrooms. Desserts are categorically magnifique.",0,0
573,Ardesia,Contemporary,2,"This is one of the area's best spots for grabbing an aperitivo and bite after work. Service is young, friendly, and knowledgeable, so make sure to ask for a recommendation as it can yield tasty rewards. Towering ceilings and a wall of windows seem to augment the rather petite space; and a chalkboard wall lists wines available by the glass, even if the most impressive selections are only offered by the bottle on the menu. Contemporary small plates begin with notable cheese offerings like ricotta Ginepro, cold-smoked sheep's milk, and pale yellow Ossau Iraty accompanied by a walnut covered in date-coconut jam and thick, crusty bread from Amy's. Sample skewers lined with garlicky shrimp or spiced lamb. Then finish with a sweet and earnest take on homemade s'mores.",0,0
574,Osteria del Circo,Italian,3,"Step right up to this bold and buzzy midtown destination for a tasteful take on the Big Top, courtesy of the Maccioni family. The setting is a riot of theme and color: a trapeze hangs figurines above the entrance, red-and-white fabrics billow from the tent-like ceiling, harlequin-upholstered seating surrounds tables set with cobalt goblets, and animal sculptures are stationed throughout. The crackerjack menu highlights thin-crust pizza, Tuscan fish soup (cacciucco alla Livornese); as well as wonderful hand-made pastas like silky tortelli stuffed with finely chopped radicchio and taleggio, dressed with an earthy mushroom purée and salty speck. Italian-American classics like clams casino, eggplant Parmigiana, and chicken Marsala punctuate the lineup.",0,0
575,Tang Pavilion,Chinese,2,"This longstanding, elegant Chinese favorite is a delightful contrast to its brassy midtown location. Set foot inside the hushed dining room featuring pale peach walls dressed with black lacquer trim. Jacketed servers dote on a dressy crowd savoring Shanghainese specialties. The kitchen offers countless delectable house delicacies emphasizing the regional focus. Honey ham Shanghai-style is a sweet and salty treat dressed with dates and lotus seeds. The ""eight jewels with hot paste"" is a mouthwateringly spiced stir-fry of mushrooms, bamboo shoots, wheat gluten, scallops, chicken, and shrimp. Green beans with tofu sheets is a gorgeously simple combo of soybeans and paper-thin ribbons of bean curd skin judiciously bathed in a light, broth-based sauce.",0,0
576,pizzArte,Italian,2,"The serene, slender, bi-level dining room that is pizzaArte stands in stark contrast to the workaday bustle outside its doors. A bar and a domed wood-burning pizza oven populate the first floor, while the upstairs is filled with closely set tables and gallery-white walls displaying original art. Expect the room to be packed with a chic, Italian-accented clientele who flock here for blissfully authentic Neapolitan-style pizzas. These are baked to perfect pliability with a bit of char, topped with impeccable ingredients like creamy mozzarella di bufala, broccoli rabe, and sausage. Fine cooking skills are displayed in the paccheri al baccala, tossing pasta tubes with cherry tomatoes, plump Sicilian capers, intense Gaeta olives, and firm fillets of cod.",0,0
577,Taboon,Middle Eastern,2,"Taboon's namesake brick-walled, wood-fired oven is burning a bit brighter these days since Chef Efi Nahon has returned to Hell's Kitchen's finest Middle Eastern dining room. That oven not only provides a heartwarming welcome and sets the whitewashed interior aglow, but it is also responsible for baking the incredible plank of bread that is alone worth a trip here. Bring friends because this midtown marvel's recently revised menu is best enjoyed by grazing the zesty meze like house-made scallop and crab sausage shakshooka with poached quail egg, or wild mushroom bread pudding with creamy talleggio and romesco. Vegetables aren't spared the flames, as in a luscious and healthy pile of roasted broccolini splashed with orange oil.",0,0
578,Aquavit,Scandinavian,4,"Gorgeously Scandinavian yet pleasantly corporate, Aquavit is a tribute to the Nordic culinary movement with more midtown-friendly appeal. The décor flaunts a bit of playfulness thanks to a mossy green carpet, fur-covered bag stools, and retro lighting. The ambience is quiet and waiters a tad imperious. Evening tasting menus and a wonderful three-course prix-fixe with overlapping options mean that an array of appetites and budgets can be readily accommodated. The dinner hour is when the chef's true style shines most brightly, through clean and unfussy cooking that is a lovely blend of European techniques and Scandinavian flavors. Klädesholmen Matjes herring is reinvented for the modern palate, encrusted in seeds and rye cubes served on a piece of slate, alongside soft-boiled quail eggs, Västerbotten cheese, and a swipe of horseradish. Follow this with a springtime composition of crisp-skinned Arctic char over pea purée, nettles, sweet and snap peas, and a few halved shrimp. Desserts that feature a textural composition of chocolates are a contemporary highlight. Lunch is a low-key, business-like gathering of Swedish meatballs and skagen, but the service is thankfully far less uptight.",2,1
579,Radiance Tea House,Asian,2,"Radiance Tea House is a delicious midtown curiosity. The ordinary locale obscures its presence, but one step inside reveals an unexpected world of green tea and tranquility. Walls are shelved with books about tea and wellness to peruse or purchase, as well as a selection of tea tins and ceramic ware. Arrive during the lunchtime peak and the scent of rice wine vinegar wafts through the air from tables loaded with dumplings and dipping sauce. A vast selection of loose-leaf blends is offered to be enjoyed alongside chicken wontons with house-made chili oil, green tea soba noodles with sesame sauce, and shrimp-stuffed baby bok choy. Tea lovers note that a traditional Chinese tea ceremony can be booked one day in advance for a minimum of two persons.",0,0
580,P.J. Clarke's,Gastropub,2,"Old time and on the ball, P.J. Clarke's drips with New York history-ad men and business execs have patronized this pour house for generations, and with good reason. Besides a dazzling medley of drinks, the kitchen sends out a crowd-pleasing menu showcasing solid technique. Following its repute, the distinct décor spotlights notable artifacts, worn floors, and smartly dressed tables. Weekends draw a touristy set, but who's complaining with an amazing Bloody Mary so close at hand? Highlights include potato chips with an outrageously gooey blue cheese gratin; braised short rib spring rolls with horseradish-tinged sour cream; and tuna tartare tacos filled with scallion and sesame seeds. The cheeseburger is as classic and on-point as the staff itself.",0,0
581,Estiatorio Milos,Greek,3,"This Greek restaurant offers such a deliciously singular focus on the sea that dinner here feels like a relaxing jaunt to the Mediterranean coast. Feast your eyes on the ever-present bounty of iced fish, flown in fresh and displayed in the back of the cavernous room where a well-dressed, business-minded crowd gathers. Oregano plants atop each table are snipped into bowls of olive oil to accompany the fine bread that precedes the selection of raw bar specialties and grilled fish. The day's bounty may reveal charred barbouni, or red mullet, dressed with olive oil, capers, and a sprig of flat leaf parsley. Side dishes unveil chtipiti-a mouthwatering spread made from roasted red peppers and barrel-aged feta that you'll want to slather on everything.",0,0
582,Chavela's,Mexican,1,"Look for the light blue dome and wrought-iron doors to enter Chavela's and discover an absolute riot of color inside. From the bar's Mexican tiles to the wall of ceramic butterflies, the room is an explosion of artistic sensibilities. Guacamole is just as pleasing as the setting, whether going for a traditional or creative version mixed with flaky smoked trout, pico de gallo, and morita chile salsa. Small, crisp taquitos de cangrego filled with the perfect balance of sweet crabmeat, salsa verde, white cheese, and crema Mexicana are irresistible. Costilla en salsa verde (deliciously tender, mild pork short rib stew) is studded with nopales swimming in a thick, verdant sauce, and served with a delectable mountain of yellow rice and refried black beans.",0,0
583,Naya,Lebanese,2,"Amid this bland stretch of cheap booze and loud beats lies Naya, a tiny and mod neighborhood spot with tasty Lebanese fare. Inside, the streamlined décor feels smart and attractive, with white pleather booths contrasting against shiny dark tables. This sleek aesthetic runs to the back where a large table is best for suit-donning groups. Most love Naya for its vast choice of Lebanese meze and daily specials featuring home-style food with modern flair. It is clear that this is a professional operation, as obliging waiters present you with the likes of a ""quick Naya"" lunch special unveiling generous portions of fattoush, labne, and baba ghannouj. A chicken shawarma sandwich reaches epic scopes when paired with their deliciously tangy homemade pickles.",0,0
584,Armani Ristorante,Italian,3,"At Giorgio Armani's Fifth Avenue restaurant what you're wearing is as important as what you're eating. Overlooking the famous street, models serve as (distracted) staff members and bartenders are pure showstoppers-to no one's surprise. Would you expect anything less of the man whose luxurious Armani Casa furniture lines the space? His streamlined and modern aesthetic prevails, right down to the glistening, ruby-red tuna tartare. Each cube cut by hand, the sea-fresh fish rolls in truffle oil and chives with briny sea beans and trout roe for a fantastic play on texture. Equally precise, the pan-seared spring flounder is infused with a coriander reduction, fresh porcini, and fennel with an airy foam that looks so good it may as well be Photoshopped.",0,0
585,Molyvos,Greek,2,"Enter this popular home to Greek gourmands and Carnegie Hall patrons to find a stacked display of Chef/partner Jim Botsacos' cookbook New Greek Cuisine-a confident yet auspicious welcome to Molyvos's laudable cooking. The upscale dining room basks in a creamy palette with touches of warm orange and black-and-white photography. The bar area is more casual, with bare tables and woven placemats. The menu boasts mezedes like lamb pie with vlahotiri cheese, and classic piperies yemistes that stuff roasted red peppers with a zesty mixture of rice, tomato, dill and manouri cheese. Strained yogurt with quince compote and toasted almonds is a sweet finish. An interesting list of Greek wines, Mediterranean beers, and ouzo is deliciously suited to the cooking.",0,0
586,Yakitori Totto,Japanese,2,"To say that this yakitori-ya nails authenticity is an epic understatement. Its discreet signage and second floor location feels more Tokyo than Manhattan, J-pop dominates the playlist, and the crowd is a reassuring mix of Japanese-speakers and in-the-know foodies. Best of all is the aroma of sizzling skewers that are deftly prepared over a charcoal fire. It's all about grilled meats here, like buta karashi-pork loin with sweet onion and spicy mustard-but that doesn't mean you should skip yakumi zaru tofu, soft cubes dressed with slivered green onion, bonito flakes, ginger, and ume salt. At lunch, go for yakitori don with skewers of chicken breast and green onion (negima) over rice, paired with pickled cucumbers and licked by a sweet yakitori sauce.",0,0
587,Má Pêche,Fusion,2,"Midtown's version of Momofuku is a soaring space furnished in sleek blonde wood and located on the lower level of the Chambers hotel. Like all siblings, this ""Lucky Peach"" family member strives to make its own voice heard-and it does so successfully. Dim sum Momofuku-style is the name of the game here, and stimulating small plates are wheeled around the canvas-wrapped expanse. The gastro chain's iconic pork buns are presented on their own cart in mini bamboo steamers. A raw bar wagon is stocked with torched sea scallop crudo dressed with yuzu and olive oil; and hot treats include succulent jerk chicken wings. Be sure to save room for dessert, as goodies from Milk Bar star and may include birthday cake truffles, or blueberry-miso soft-serve.",0,0
588,BLT Steak,Steakhouse,4,"The best steakhouse in New York City is hotly contested among many contenders, but this handsome retreat sets itself apart with genuine hospitality, great management, and Sunday nights filled with hungry families and friends. This spot nails crowd-pleasing dishes like addictively hot popovers the size of softballs served to every table, which are extra delicious when slathered with butter and sea salt. Steaks are good, but sides truly excel, from inch-thick and perfectly crunchy onion rings to umami-rich and salty roasted mushrooms. Even crispy potato skins get the special treatment here-first baked, then deep-fried, and finally topped with bacon, cheese, sour cream, and chives. It may be a precursor to a heart attack, but it's worth every bite.",0,0
589,Obikà,Italian,2,"Conveniently located in the glass atrium of the IBM building, Obikà exudes an elegant yet casual style that attracts slim suits and sleek shoppers alike. Plentiful sunlight lends an airy feel to the space, which offers counter dining and table seating, smartly separated from the building's lobby with planters. The focus here is the truly exceptional mozzarella-fresh bufala, hauntingly smoked, or tangy burrata-which can be paired with a tagliere of cured meats and/or grilled vegetables for a perfectly light lunch. The menu ventures on to offer an exceptional rendition of lasagna tradizionale, made with delicate layers of pasta, hearty beef ragù, béchamel, and a showering of parmesan. Come dessert, the tiramisu is another classic.",0,0
590,Fitzcarraldo,Italian,2,"Nestled into a remote web of Brooklyn where hip East Williamsburg meets even hipper Bushwick, it was almost guaranteed that the new Fitzcarraldo (brought to you by Rucola partners, Henry Rich and Julian Brizzi) would deliver on style. And that it does-welcoming diners with a lazy string of bistro lights, an enormous picture window, rustic bare wood tables, and a thumping open kitchen. It's a sexy, clandestine little nook, perfected with industrial style. Luckily, the delicious food is given equal attention, with a sharp-as-tacks service staff pushing out creative fare like the warm, crispy farinata, served in a cast iron skillet and humming with fragrant pesto and a chunky tomato sauce; or tender orecchiette bathed in creamy cacio e pepe.",0,0
591,Gladys,Caribbean,2,"A popular sandwich shop turned Caribbean joint, Gladys makes it possible to sip a custom cocktail and live the Caribbean dream without leaving Crown Heights. Chef/owner Michael Jacober has transformed this corner location into a festive, turquoise destination, with a kitchen full of cooks roasting, grilling, and pan-frying jerk specialties, including fresh lobster. It's no surprise that the wood-fired, whole porgy makes for a delicious and generous dish, with its smoky notes and accents like refreshing cucumber, pickled onion, and mango. Whale-sized, unshelled, and peppered shrimp arrive head-on with traditional Jamaican garlic, habanero, and a flirtatious dash of allspice. Dishes are remarkably luscious and flavor-packed at budget prices.",0,0
592,Benares,Indian,2,"Unassuming inside and out, Benares serves solid Northern Indian fare in a casual setting. The South Asian clientele is testament to its authenticity. The décor may seem a bit limited, but thoughtful touches include a colorful glass chandelier and a framed painting of women washing clothes along the Ganges (in the restaurant's namesake city). Fragrant spice mixtures abound as seen in succulent and crunchy shrimp marinated with ajwain, garlic, and ginger, then grilled in the tandoor. Curry offerings showcase boldly satisfying comfort food, such as bowls of fork-tender rezala, the goat served bone-in with fragrant saffron and creamy yogurt. Any meal here should be accompanied by pillow-soft naan, and thick cucumber raita dotted with a pungent masala.",0,0
593,Roberta's,Contemporary,2,"Entering through this (now) iconic red door is like a trip through the looking glass and into Bushwick's foodie wonderland. The city's love affair with Roberta's seems stronger each year, and for good reason. Everything from the industrial space to the underground Bohemian vibe epitomizes Brooklyn-chic. A new takeaway option has been added to the compound, so when the wait for a table is too long, snag a porchetta sandwich to-go. Queens native Carlo Mirarchi leads a talented kitchen and its menu of beautifully prepared pasta, vegetables, and more. Many diners stick to the creatively named, less than purely Italian pizza, like the Speckenwolf: freshly dried oregano, house-made mozzarella, thinly sliced speck, red onion, and roasted cremini mushrooms.",0,0
594,John Brown Smokehouse,Barbecue,2,"Regional barbecue has arrived in the city, but John Brown continues his reign as the true ""bawss"" for Kansas-style bites. The décor is minimal with a front area plating infinite orders, but find a seat in the back and settle in for a serious shindig. Amid sepia-toned photos and a flat-screen showing football (a religion here), find famished city folk ordering perfectly done proteins served with a thick and rich barbecue sauce. Rib tips and burnt ends are juicy, tender, and sumptuous when paired with tart, spicy kimchi. And, sandwiches like seasoned ground beef piled high on a brioche with pickles are as hearty and warming as plates of pollo gregorio slathered with still more of that sweet and signature barbecue sauce. Finger-licking is an inevitable end.",0,0
595,Arrogant Swine,Barbecue,1,"A boon to this otherwise industrial warehouse neighborhood, Arrogant Swine's whitewashed brick walls and rows of picnic tables steadily fill with hungry patrons. Striking exterior wall murals and the aroma of sweet smoke both impress from the approach. Heat lamps extend the season for savoring slow-cooked pork outdoors, with rock music and a smoke-fueled barbecue buzz in the background. Whole hog barbecue is the specialty here-smoked slow and whole over live embers, resulting in tender, glistening meat. The loin, shoulder, jowl, and more are then chopped or pulled and tossed with Carolina-style vinegar sauce. Sides complete the downhome experience, especially their traditional cornpone (savory cornbread in an iron skillet with bacon drippings and slaw).",0,0
596,Mr Chow,Chinese,4,"Oh Mr Chow, how you hook the hordes with your flavorful fusion and fancy prices! Perhaps it's the retro scene decked in black-and-white, lacquered Asian-accented chairs, and glinting mirrors. Or, maybe it's the noodle guy's theatrical display of hand-pulling? Whatever the hype, Mr Chow still has it and Sutton suits along with their wealthy wives party here like it's 1999. Attentive service and flowing drinks keep everything moving as fans nibble away on the well-priced Beijing duck prix-fixe with four starters along with entrées. Tender orange chicken satay and water dumplings with seafood are tasty, but Dungeness crab sautéed with egg whites, and ma mignon, cubes of tender fried beef tossed in a sweet-spicy sauce laced with scallions truly get the crowd going.",0,0
597,Betony,Contemporary,4,"Midtown and Betony go together like caviar and blinis. Serious funds have been invested to create this smart, grown-up restaurant and its gilded features, wood paneling, and well-spaced tables provide very comfortable surroundings in which to do business or impress friends. The experienced service team, though, do a good job in ensuring the atmosphere never veers into the terminal seriousness that blights many a formal restaurant. When one surveys this luxurious backdrop and the impeccably manicured clientele, it is perhaps something of a surprise to find that the food is adventurous and creative. Chef Bryce Shuman and his kitchen team know all the latest cooking techniques and are not afraid to use them. Ravioli with smoked potato shows off their delicate touch but the grilled short rib demonstrates that they also know how to create layers of flavor. The menu comes in four sections and one is gently encouraged to have all four, although the hors d'oeuvres are meant more for sharing with a drink. Speaking of drinks, make sure you start by ordering a milk punch-the kitchen isn't the only team here who has some clever ideas and the ability to see them through.",1,1
598,Eugene & Co.,American,2,"Straddling a corner of Brooklyn's increasingly trendy Bed-Stuy, you'll spot homey little Eugene & Co. by its sweet hanging planters and soft light emanating from its large windows. It's the kind of rustic, farm-to-table restaurant you might find tucked away in a small town in California; its exposed brick walls lined with artwork and hand-tufted banquettes. Cheerful waiters, clearly invested in the evening's menu, meander from table to table, discussing the food and dropping dishes like a ripe stone fruit and prosciutto salad with salted honey Cloumage cheese; or a tower of savory fried green tomatoes laced with buttermilk dressing; or moist meatloaf tucked into a soft roll and dressed with fresh cabbage, pickles, and barbecue sauce.",0,0
599,Norma's,American,2,"Serving heaping platters of breakfast well into the afternoon, Norma's may have been inspired by the humble diner but rest assured that she is no greasy spoon. Tables at this Le Parker Meridien dining room are bound to be filled with business types already dealing over the first meal of the day. Upscale touches include tables wide enough to accommodate a laptop beside your plate, a polished staff, and gratis smoothie shots. The menu adds personality with whimsically titled dishes like ""bing popping waffles"" or ""Normalita's huevos rancheros."" The crunchy French toast's outrageously good sweetness begins with a marshmallow-y layering of crisped rice, gilded with a sprinkling of powdered sugar, ramekin of caramel sauce, and individual bottle of maple syrup.",0,0
600,Brasserie 8 1/2,French,3,"Dress-up, descend that sweeping staircase, and make a grand entrance upon stepping into this well-lit, spacious, grown-up canteen. The serene lounge, with just a handful of tables and walls boasting original works by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, is a rarefied gift that feels worlds away from midtown's cacophony. The masculine, clubby aura of the dining room showcases ivory terrazzo floors, exotic wood veneer-lined walls, polished metal columns, and more artwork. Talented Chef Franck Deletrain brings a traditional vision of brasserie cooking in items such as coq au vin; or saucisson chaud, braised pork sausage nestled in a bed of lentils du Puy. Finish with pear poached in spiced red wine, with mascarpone and pistachio financiers.",0,0
601,Blanca,Contemporary,4,"Tucked deep into the Roberta's compound-that den of restaurant cool that helped elevate seedy Bushwick into a legitimately haute food 'hood-lays this gleaming warehouse kitchen aimed at the serious eater. If you're lucky enough to snag a seat at Blanca, you'll make your way first into Roberta's lively, corrugated metal-facade, past the delicious smell of their wood-burning pizza oven and sound of vinyl records playing the blues, and through the buzzing outdoor garden. Can this many tattooed urbanites and Millennials know something you don't? Indeed. Blanca's interior is sleek and minimal, with a pristine white counter lined with cognac leather stools positioned to watch the chefs create each dish. Chef Carlo Mirarchi's nightly 20-course menu is never published beforehand, nor does the restaurant take any dietary accommodations into account. The message is loud and clear: trust us and we'll delight your senses. And delight it does as dinner might begin with deep orange lobes of sea urchin dusted with coarse sea salt and a tiny dollop of warm polenta. Then move on to impeccably fresh sliced fluke in almond water and plum vinegar, topped with fennel fronds; or tender ravioli fat with spicy 'nduja and laced with zesty grated orange.",2,1
602,BG,American,3,"On the 7th floor of Bergdorf Goodman, BG offers ladylike posh to the label-conscious clientele of this fashion emporium. The Kelly Wearstler-designed brasserie combines springtime hues with hand-printed Chinoiserie wallpaper, gilded fixtures, and lacquered accents. Large windows frame killer Central Park vistas and highlight the well-coiffed crowd savoring a number of fine salads. However, the carte du jour offers more vibrant dining with decadent renditions of American comfort favorites, like lobster mac and cheese. The silken tomato basil soup is enriched with just the slightest hint of cream; and Israeli couscous is infused with smoked paprika and stocked with seared black bass and shellfish. Afternoon tea is a suitably refined affair.",0,0
603,Land of Plenty,Chinese,2,"A sleek, clean, and subterranean space attended to by adept servers, this Chinese haven feels far more nice and elegant than the other Sichuan spots in midtown. Instead of sweet-and-sour pork, crowds of lively, food-savvy diners come for authentic lunchtime specials prepared by a cadre of talented chefs. The food is just plain stellar, featuring excellent versions of this cuisine's classics, which may start with addictive pickled vegetables or soft pork dumplings paired with sweet soy. While some settle on crunchy conch bathed in roasted chili oil, others opt for smoked duck fried rice to pair with sautéed crispy chicken tossed with chilies and sesame seeds. String beans stir-fried with minced pork and bamboo shoots is a revelatory way to end the affair.",0,0
604,Krupa Grocery,American,2,"Though it only recently opened its doors, Krupa Grocery makes you want to become a regular right out of the gate. Chef Domenick Gianfrancesco's food is so simple, fresh, and perfectly calibrated, it's hard to miss here. Get things started with a selection of country toast, served with delicious spreads like one of smashed pea and fava bean with pecorino, tarragon vinaigrette, and pea leaves; or whipped lardo with crisp radish, caper salad, and parsley. For dinner, try the buttermilk-fried skate, served over a bed of cracked hominy with basil seeds and salsa verde. Designed with a long industrial bar that's perfect for solo eating or lingering couples, the interior is effortlessly cool, but the place to be come summer is undoubtedly the gorgeous backyard.",0,0
605,Petrossian,French,3,"With such exemplary attributes-location, historic setting, and a refined staff-this French bastion smacks of old-world indulgence. The exterior's detailed stonework features frolicking cherubs and griffins, while a wrought-iron door guards the entrance. Inside, the dining room harkens back to the 80s with its mirrored bar and pink-and-black granite. Lalique crystal fixtures add a touch of timeless bling. The best way to begin a meal at Petrossian is to partake in some caviar, smoked salmon, or foie gras (all available for purchase next door in the boutique). Then dive into a bowl of borscht, served with tiny meat-filled pastries, before treating your palate to seared diver sea scallops with sweet English peas, plump morels, bottarga, and parmesan nage.",0,0
606,Le Cirque,European,4,"This legendary Sirio Maccioni restaurant opened its doors over 40 years ago to a very different Manhattan, but its timeless cuisine still packs the house. The dramatic interior alone warrants a visit: a beautiful semi-circular dining room boasting arching banquettes; a soaring wall of windows; and draping overhead canopies. Chef Raphael Francois is currently holding court in Le Cirque's kitchen, effortlessly blending time-honored recipes with delicious new additions. Don't miss the grilled octopus salad, with tender rainbow potatoes, cherry tomatoes, taggiasca olives, and fresh herbs; or the (Daniel Boulud-created) paupiette of black bass, wrapped in thin sheets of potato, laced with a lovely red wine sauce and served over melted leeks.",0,0
607,Loi Estiatorio,Greek,2,"Chef, cookbook authority, and restaurateur Marisa Loi has moved her refined take on traditional Greek cuisine to this new address, formerly the home of Seäsonal. The room is minimally revamped, with dark leather furnishings and panoramic photos of sun-bleached coastline that hang on the pale walls. Lovers of Greek cuisine will revel in the cooking's familiar scents and flavors, while marveling at the kitchen's unique, inspired spin. It's possible to feast on starters alone like ladolemono-dressed grilled octopus with fava bean purée, or papoutsakia (stuffed eggplant topped with caramelized béchamel sauce). But, don't overlook the entrées-rooster, braised in red wine as well as spiced tomato sauce and served over Greek pasta, is especially decadent.",0,0
608,Felidia,Italian,4,"Cookbook author, television series host, and restaurateur Lidia Bastianich has been behind this flagship restaurant and greeting customers since 1981. Service could use a little finesse and some of Bastianich's charm, but the elegant décor inspires dressing up for dinner and the exceptional wine list offers a vast collection of Italian choices. Signature paste sparkle here, such as cacio e pere ravioli stuffed with delicate pear and bathed in black pepper and pecorino. Massive portions of scallops, squid, a split langoustine, and lobster star in the grigliata drizzled with lemon vinaigrette. Rely on Lidia to deliver a cannoli that lives up to its true potential-envision narrow tubes filled with lemony ricotta cream spilling into the center of the plate.",0,0
609,Bistro Vendôme,French,2,"The nearby residents of Sutton Place fit Bistro Vendôme, a classic sort of spot where three cozy dining rooms, top-notch service, and excellent food come together seamlessly. Often glimpsed gliding across the restaurant, the husband-and-wife owners warmly cater to locals during pleasant but humming dinner hours. The space makes everyone feel lucky-such solid dining options don't typically exist this far east. Familiar and well-done classics may include an enjoyably but never over-whelmingly flavorful fish soup sided with Gruyère cheese, rouille, and croûtes. The well-executed striped bass arrives with a bed of zucchini cooked in a fragrant tomato-saffron broth; while an ile flottante with caramel sauce is like an ode to a Parisian bistro.",0,0
610,Bottega del Vino,Italian,4,"For true Northern Italian elegance, Bottega del Vino is divine, no matter the time of day. In front, casual Bar Quadronno caters to local business people looking to meet for a European-style breakfast, light lunch, or unbeatable cappuccino. Head to the more formal, rear dining room with tables dressed in white to savor a very authentic Italian meal. Veronese influence is clear from the start, with dishes like whole grilled calamari served simply over a bed of arugula drizzled in excellent olive oil with a splash of lemon. The pillowy spinach and potato gnocchi swimming in a creamy sauce with crisp prosciutto and pecorino outdoes most other plates like it in the city. Finish with warm Nutella-filled crêpes served with vanilla ice cream.",0,0
611,Marea,Seafood,4,"There are some restaurants that have a discernible pulse that makes you immediately aware you've arrived somewhere a little special. At this elegant and refined Italian restaurant you aren't so much as welcomed in as taken in hand and enveloped in a sort of benevolent bubble of care. It's a grown up establishment with a suitably urbane clientele who all look at home in this part of town. Sit in the main dining room where all the action happens, rather than in the alcove off the bar-which is undoubtedly-Siberia. As the name suggests, seafood and shellfish lie at the heart of the menu. And needless to say, the ingredients are not only of irreproachable quality but are also treated with respect and deftness by the kitchen, whether it's the brilliant white halibut or the salt-baked wild bass. Start with the crudo, and then head for a generous bowl of homemade pasta such as tagliolini with clams and calamari, followed by a whole fish or a classic entrée. It's not of course compulsory to stick to fish-the lamb chops make a worthy alternative. The wine list is a deserving tome and along with the big names are some lesser known growers who merit investigation.",2,1
612,Anassa Taverna,Greek,2,"Two floors of whitewashed brick walls and large windows dressed with sheer drapery provide a respite for weary shoppers and a sociable clientele at this contemporary taverna. The upstairs dining room is sedate, but remains your best bet when crowds pack the ground-level bar area. Anassa's menu is an honest presentation of Greek specialties, including a platter of spreads, sushi-quality charcoal-broiled octopus, and a selection of Mediterranean and North Atlantic fish to be grilled and dressed with extra virgin olive oil, fresh lemon, and capers. Nightly specials add further variety to the extensive menu. Don't miss Wednesday's luscious slow-roasted pork shoulder served fork-tender in a parchment bundle with fresh herbs and wedges of lemon potatoes.",0,0
613,Per Se,Contemporary,4,"There is no more dramatic departure from the soulless Time Warner Center than entering through the iconic blue doors to Per Se. An upscale sense of calm-the kind that only money can buy-instantly soaks the atmosphere. The words posh and exclusive come to mind when admiring the spacious tables, corner banquettes, and stunning views. Chef Thomas Keller continues to raise the bar with meals that express artistry and seasonality right down to the moment. A classic since day one, the ""oysters and pearls"" still swim in that bath of luxurious caviar. Summery flavors reach their peak in the beautiful roulade of veal breast en persillade. The extraordinary vegetable tasting menu will threaten to convert the most die-hard omnivore with chestnut- and mascarpone-filled agnolotti dressed with julienned Tuscan kale and pickled Swiss chard stems. Flavors and textures may temporarily veer off into strange (and slow) territory during cheese and dessert courses. While this innovative and creative vision may delight some, it will confound others. No matter. The celebrated ""coffee and doughnuts"" is a grand finale. Those without reservations can stop at the opulent Salon, where much of the menu is available à la carte.",3,1
614,Masa,Japanese,4,"To taste what may be the continent's best sushi, experience the quiet, contemplative, and very exclusive ceremony of Chef Masa Takayama's omakase. Through the heavy wooden door, discover a room that is as unchanging and calming as a river stone, set amid blonde hinoki wood and a gargantuan forsythia tree. Yes, you'll forget it's on the fourth floor of a mall. Attention to detail is unsurpassed; that bespoke Japanese porcelain seems designed specifically for the sweet shrimp it holds. Service displays the same smooth grace, unobtrusive yet at-the-ready with their hot towels, fingerbowls, tea, and touches of pedagogy or insight. Don't let their tendency to upsell extra courses mar your pleasure. A seaweed salad of vinegar-seasoned jellyfish awakens the palate to the subtle progression of courses that follow. Masterful proportion and elemental balance is unparalleled in the mind-melting toro tartare with salty grains of Californian osetra caviar and toasted bread for crunch. Yet Masa truly distinguishes itself with its parade of sushi showcasing the best of Tokyo's Tsukiji market. Expect phenomenal aji mackerel with grated yuzu, traditional unagi, and an indelible finish of toro temaki.",3,1
615,Bar Masa,Japanese,3,"Make no mistake: Masa's adjacent lounge is by no means a bargain substitute for the stunner next door. Bar Masa remains as hopping as when it first opened, and on any given night every tightly packed seat is perpetually filled-thanks in part to a no-reservations policy. Despite the crowds, softly lit Japanese limestone walls give the room an air of serenity. The long list of creative sips are excellent, so lay your lips on a cucumber mint gimlet while eagerly awaiting selections off the extensive menu. Serious effort is blatantly apparent: raw petals of sakura trout are tantalizingly dressed; pudding-soft tofu and perfectly ripe avocado are a heavenly pairing for an uramaki; and fluffy wild mushroom fried rice is sprinkled with wasabi salt.",0,0
616,Porter House,Steakhouse,4,"Michael Lomonaco's flagship steakhouse offers unparalleled views of Central Park from its Time Warner Center perch. Here, tables are well-spaced and allow for fine dining, but look for those few intimate booths located in the front bar area-they make for a great escape on busy nights. The views certainly distinguish this handsome retreat from the pack, as do its carefully selected aged meats, quality fish, and expert sides. The kitchen puts out a tasty helping of sweet and spicy onion rings, buttermilk-battered and deep-fried in portions designed for linebackers. The beautifully marbled ribeye is aged for more than 45 days and would be delicious simply seared, though a chili rub adds an aggressive spice. Cool down with a lightly dressed purslane salad.",0,0
617,The Regency Bar & Grill,Contemporary,3,"The Loews Regency now serves up a contemporary vision of hotel dining that can stand entirely on its own. Fully-stocked glass-and-metal shelves at the bar invites passersby to ditch Park Avenue for a cocktail before sinking into the plush dining room, where ivory leather and sky-blue velvet seating is laid out over carpeting inspired by Italian mosaic tiles. The setting's fresh face is a fitting home for Chef Dan Silverman's au courant cuisine in which shaved radishes and julienned snow peas are combined with pickled shiitake mushrooms and sesame dressing for an inspired salad. Grilled double-cut lamb loin chop, cooked perfectly to spec and plated with a stack of panisse- and mint-infused béarnaise sauce, is a sweet dream in the making.",0,0
618,Tiella,Italian,2,"Neapolitan specialties and gracious hospitality make Tiella absolutely worth seeking out. This railcar-sized space is set along a traffic-clogged stretch, but once inside, the ambience is sweet with espresso-tinted wood furnishings set against cream walls and exposed brick. Petite pizzas baked in the wood-fired oven arrive bearing fresh mozzarella, spicy 'nduja, and fava beans, among other tasty combinations. Starters include gallette, chickpea flour fritters stacked with stracciatella and shaved prosciutto, drizzled with fig syrup, and stuck with a sprig of rosemary. Enjoyable primi include risotto studded with diced artichokes, pancetta, and showered with shaved black truffle. Desserts like the lemon-soaked delizia al limone are homespun delights.",0,0
619,Nougatine,Contemporary,2,"Nougatine is a bright, stylish, and contemporary space on the ground floor of the Trump International Hotel bookended by an open kitchen at one end and a huge picture window the other. What really sets it apart, however, is the service: the restaurant is run with lots of flair and no little professionalism by a vast army of servers-this is not one of the places where you need to use semaphore to get noticed by your waiter. The food is light and current and the lunch menu, with dishes taken from the main à la carte, is a positive steal-although the immaculately coiffured clientele did not seem the sort to be overly concerned by the concept of a bargain. Dishes like veal Milanese are confidently executed and it's worth leaving room for desserts, like apple tart.",0,0
620,Jean-Georges,Contemporary,4,"The crown-jewel restaurant of a crown-jewel Trump hotel, Jean-Georges reigns supreme over the Central Park dining scene. Facing its lush grounds and mighty Columbus himself, the restaurant's separate entrance can be something of a whirlwind as guests must pass through buzzing Nougatine to arrive at this silver-gray dining room. Still, those immense windows, columns, and twinkling skyline views make this a very special place. On weekdays, the feel is formal and business-driven, while weekends hum with affluent tourists, local socialites, and an easier vibe. The highly professional service staff is one well-oiled and smooth machine. While the contemporary menu is fixed, options are numerous and particularly appealing. Let the fascinating interplay of flavors begin with sea trout and oyster tartare merged with horseradish cream, lemon, and chive oil. Simple but lavish elegance underscores a perfectly cooked Maine lobster accompanied by roasted chili paste. Composed with Asian flavors and French technique, this is a standout worthy of a special occasion. And in place of a single, haunting finale, desserts are served as a ""sampler"" focused on one ingredient-say caramel-in all its outrageous glory.",3,1
621,El Porrón,Spanish,2,"Black-and-white portraits of people pouring streams of wine into their mouths directly from porróns-blown glass wine vessels with long, tapered spouts-give you the idea of what this spot is all about. Dark colors give a cloistered feel to the intimate space, which is a pleasant contrast to its traffic-clogged location. The kitchen churns out a graceful, all-encompassing array of tapas, large plates, and even paellas worth their 40-minute wait. Sample bites like canned esparragos blancos Navarro-their thick, tender stalks are served cool and dressed with Chardonnay vinaigrette-or bacalao a la Vizcaina, Basque-style salt cod with a sauce melding the flavors of roasted peppers, garlic, olives, and potatoes served in a bubbling hot cazuela.",0,0
622,The Nuaa,Thai,2,"The Nuaa offers a certain sultry vibe to this rather blah, trafficky stretch-it's dim and moody even in the middle of the day. Shimmering gold accents pop against the room's brown leather seating, carved woodwork, and dark palette. Fans of Thai cuisine will enjoy the pleasantly pungent notes throughout the selection of salads and noodle dishes. Crunchy curried rice salad features deep-fried nuggets strewn with Thai sausage and lemongrass served with plenty of shallots, long beans, and lettuce, and a drizzle of Kaffir lime-mint vinaigrette. The kanom jeen features thin rice noodles soaked in a mildly spiced coconut-rich yellow curry that is generously stocked with huge lumps of crab meat, chopped pickled mustard greens, and caper berries.",0,0
623,Fishtail by David Burke,Seafood,3,"First-rate seafood served in a ritzy, residential townhouse makes Fishtail a perennial hot spot. The first floor is an oyster bar and lounge swamped by after-work crowds devouring iced shellfish towers. Upstairs, find a deep-red dining room with touches that colorfully convey the ocean theme. Fresh-off-the-boat seafood is prepared with the eponymous chef's trademark stamp of creativity, resulting in dishes like pastrami-spiced smoked salmon. These gossamer slices are drizzled with horseradish crème fraîche and mustard oil, topped with fried capers, and accompanied by chewy slices of toasted pretzel. Entrées include an Asian-themed steamed black cod brushed with tamarind glaze and plated with turnip-lap cheong (Chinese sausage) cake.",0,0
624,Fig & Olive,Mediterranean,3,"This reliable, Mediterranean-inspired retreat is a popular post-museum (or post-shopping) pick. The sleek long bar glows beneath dangling light fixtures, while the shelf-lined walls are stocked with olive oils in verdant hues of green. Candles flicker over stone tables near plates of glistening olives. An olive oil tasting showcases the stark nuances of different regions and makes an ideal start to a meal, served with fluffy rosemary fougasse. Then, move on to buttery, round tartlets of Gorgonzola dolce, caramelized figs, and chopped walnuts with a pile of arugula lending peppery spark. Nutty, truffle-infused risotto with meaty mushrooms is a high note. A shot glass of luscious chocolate mousse compensates for its paltry size with absolute decadence.",0,0
625,Falansai,Vietnamese,2,"Just say yes should someone invite you to sample the amazing food at Falansai. Bay Area food enthusiasts might recognize Chef/owner Henry Trieu from his days cooking at the popular Slanted Door; here at Falansai, a pretty little nook that feels miles from the gritty streets surrounding it, Trieu elevates the already complex Vietnamese cuisine to the next level. The results will knock your socks off-honestly, you might never look at a bánh mì the same way again. Don't miss the tender shrimp fritters, enveloped in mashed cassava and chilies; fresh papaya salad laced with mint leaves, sweet poached shrimp, and crushed toasted peanuts; or a surprisingly complex and special coconut curry bobbing with sweet kabocha squash, Thai eggplant, and tender carrots.",0,0
626,Dear Bushwick,Contemporary,2,"Paying homage to the UK with a distinctly edgy spirit, Dear Bushwick is a slim, snug favorite for deliciously hearty cooking that is mingled with contemporary inflections. A handsome curving copper bar is beloved by solo diners, while hanging birdcages, a pressed-tin ceiling, and vintage portraits of sheep, kings, and churches keep the overall vibe groovy. The English-inspired menu features such devourable delights as braised ox tongue set atop navy beans and a beet green salad, but vegetarian dishes like cauliflower hash with silky potatoes, crisp granny smith apples, and a spiced curry yogurt are equally robust. Finish, of course, with a perfect Yorkshire pudding, topped with chocolate sauce, crumbled walnuts, and candied orange peel.",0,0
627,Park Avenue,Contemporary,3,"This Flatiron corner with an identity crisis is now the latest incarnation of the uptown stalwart known for changing inspiration with each season. Larger than its previous digs, Park Avenue is a sprawling canvas on which design firm AvroKO works its magic. The restaurant remains a family affair, with father and son Alan and Michael Stillman steadily steering the concept alongside Chef/partner Craig Koketsu. Just like the décor, the menu fully celebrates the seasons. Hearty wintertime flavors have featured mustard seed vinaigrette, Manchego, and chestnut honey-drizzled kale-and-chorizo salad. The whimsical ""everything"" crusted branzino is set on a smear of smoked cream cheese; while sticky toffee pudding is graced with brûléed bananas.",0,0
628,Sushi Seki,Japanese,2,"An Upper East Side standby that doesn't actually look like much, Sushi Seki combines exceptional sushi and sashimi with a casual vibe that keeps neighborhood loyalists packed in for late-night dinners and take-out. It may seem like a simple restaurant for a very good spicy tuna roll, but their excellent and unique omakase is what put it on the map as a worthy favorite. The quality and creativity of each bite shows the chef's training at Sushi of Gari, with added twists. Sample excellent toro chopped with ginger that is at once tender, fatty, and crunchy over rice; or a slice of fatty salmon with avocado sauce. Don't miss the signature hand roll of toasted nori surrounding juicy chopped scallop with crunchy tempura flakes, tobiko, and spicy mayo.",0,0
629,Marché du Sud,French,2,"Open all day and offering everything from a morning cappuccino to a late evening digestif, Marché du Sud wears many hats-gourmet shop, wine bar, dining room-without a glitch. Back issues of Paris Match (and other French-language titles) double as menu covers. Speaking of which, be sure to peruse the Alsatian tarte flambée offerings. Cette cousine of pizza features a thin, flaky crust presented with an array of toppings. Traditionalists should go for the l'authentique loaded with crème fraîche, lardons, onions, and Gruyère. The remainder of the menu also offers enjoyable specials like sienna-hued soupe de poisson, a lush coalescence of seafood, saffron, orange peel, tomato, and herbs. Follow this with roasted chicken draped in zesty mustard-cream sauce.",0,0
630,M. Wells Steakhouse,Gastropub,4,"At this ultra-hip gastropub in Long Island City, first impressions can be wildly deceiving. At first, you'll wonder if you got the right address: from the outside, M. Wells Steakhouse looks like the old auto body garage it's housed in, but step inside and wow-the interior is all gloss and swagger, from its gold-and-black wallpapered ceiling and dripping crystal chandeliers, to its sexy red walls, stunning bar area, and open, wood-burning kitchen. Service is friendly and just as polished and charming as the design; though mercifully more earnest than hip. They seem refreshingly invested in your experience, dropping dishes with explanations; checking in regularly; and genuinely thanking you for your patronage. Don't miss the opportunity to drill them on wine pairing ideas. Their answers are thoughtful and spot-on. M. Wells may bill itself as a steakhouse, but the excellent raw bar, fresh fish entrées, and unique appetizers are up for some serious best supporting nods. Don't miss the bone marrow onion soup, a rich, delicious take on the French classic; rabbit terrine studded with candied fruit, truffle, and served en croute; and decadent Paris-Brest, a crispy pastry piped with hazelnut cream.",1,1
631,Moti Mahal Delux,Indian,2,"This corner spot marks the first American location of a fine dining chain that began in Delhi and now boasts outposts throughout India. Here in NYC, Moti Mahal Delux offers two distinct seating areas: an earth-toned dining room and windowed sidewalk atrium. Their Northern dominated cuisine traces back to the kitchens of the Mughal Empire, which brought Muslim influences to the Indo subcontinent. Tasty tandoori preparations factor heavily, like anardana tikka-grilled white meat chicken infused with a pomegranate and black pepper marinade. Delightful flavors abound through the home-style mutton curry showcasing a brick-red sauce of spiced tomato, onion, and ginger; hot paratha dusted with dried mint; and mustard seed- and curry leaf-infused lemon rice.",0,0
632,JoJo,Contemporary,3,"Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's little neighborhood bistro has been serving these affluent residents for nearly a generation, offering proof that although trends may come and go, classics remain steadfast. Within Jojo's snug townhouse quarters, ritzy locals and well-heeled tourists dine at elegantly dressed tables-think starched linens and polished silver-amid terra-cotta tile floors, plum velvet banquettes, and toile drapery. The look isn't fresh or exciting, but the cuisine makes up for it. Lunch offers great value for three courses that have featured a salad of warm asparagus with avocado; pan-roasted hake and sautéed wild mushrooms dressed with lime segments and a ginger-scallion condiment; and a zucchini cake with pecan ice cream for dessert.",0,0
633,Fatty Fish,International,2,"Beneath a distinguishing orange awning, Fatty Fish is a bright spot in Yorkville. The comfy space is downright homey with its intimate rooms, creaky wood floors, and a staff that treats everyone like regulars. The cuisine reflects varied inspiration, but rest assured everything is tempting. From the sushi counter, experience skillfully knifed sashimi, chirashi, and maki. Dig into cooked fare like Japanese eggplant and wild mushroom lasagna layered with shredded pork; green curry shrimp and vegetables; or perfectly grilled filet mignon medallions dabbed with spicy Chinese-style mustard gently sweetened with honey, alongside stir-fried bok choy and a tower of crispy onion rings. End with refreshing ginger ice cream studded with strips of candied ginger.",0,0
634,Daniel,French,4,"The elegant façade, the revolving door, the sound of clinking glasses-even before you reach the dining room you feel a part of something special. This bastion of classical French cooking epitomises the ""special occasion,"" yet even those unencumbered by fiscal considerations treat it with respect. The dining room is dominated by the striking porcelain-tiled chandeliers hanging from the soaring ceiling. If you're on one of the raised tables you get to look down-literally rather than patronizingly-onto your fellow diners through the neo-classical arches. Yet thanks to the personable service, the grandeur of the room never stifles the animated atmosphere. The cooking is as sophisticated as the surroundings and the ingredients come from the top drawer. The kitchen has had an obvious classical education yet you never feel it is tied by the tyranny of tradition. Just order the succulent Niman Ranch lamb chops and you'll find them accompanied with quinoa mixed with avocado. Occasionally, over-enthusiastic garnishing can overawe the dish's main ingredient but there's no doubting this is a very capable kitchen.",2,1
635,Maria's Bistro Mexicano,Mexican,2,"In a vibrant pocket of Brooklyn, locals flock to this timeworn façade for generous portions of fresh, well-priced, and tasty Mexican cuisine. Complete with a backyard, the décor of this quirky neighborhood staple is distinctly Mexican, from its bright woven textiles and vibrant pink walls, to lava rock molcajetes that top each table. Start your meal with a delicious and filling chorizo taco topped with onion, tomato, and cilantro. Crepas de elote are stuffed with bits of tender onion, juicy corn, and poblano peppers. The chile poblano is a house specialty that satisfies with its one-two punch: the first is plumped with a savory combination of cheeses, while the other is stuffed with a beguiling mixture of chicken, almonds, diced plantain, and crunchy apple.",0,0
636,East Pole,Contemporary,3,"Just off Park Avenue's pre-war grandeur is this hip addition to the neighborhood, courtesy of the Fat Radish team. The cozy space is on the ground floor of a brownstone, so the setting is understandably narrow. East Pole's front bar is hopping, while black leather booths in the back allow parties to sit and enjoy an eclectic menu in relative peace. The stimulating cooking here begins with a salad of roasted heirloom carrots with hijiki, diced avocado, and an Asian-inspired soy-and-sesame oil vinaigrette. Then move on to explore Kiev-style chicken, stuffed with garlic butter-enriched broccoli purée, or creamy fish pie stocked with cod, lobster, and fennel. The adult ice cream sundae is a boozy combo of Scotch-chocolate ice cream and Pimm's-soaked cherries.",0,0
637,Tori Shin,Japanese,3,"When the city's best yakitori decided to up and relocate, its Upper East Side neighborhood suffered a crushing culinary loss-one that would soon become midtown's gain. And after a long construction, Tori Shin is finally welcoming both fresh and familiar faces to its brand-new Hell's Kitchen home. A small bar pouring sake, shochu, and Japanese whiskey welcomes patrons into a multi-level dining room where table seating is now offered in abundance-including a clutch of options in a mezzanine room with gorgeous gold leaf walls. Boasting 500-year old hinoki and a serene palette of sand and stone, this is an upscale, sophisticated spin on the original location. What hasn't changed, however, is the quality of the organically raised chicken parts and the expert skill in which they are sizzled over the binchotan-fired grill. Skewers of crisped wing, seared heart, and creamy liver need nothing more than a few grains of salt to express true flavor. Ordering à la carte is a fun way to explore the menu, which offers grilled vegetables and items like chicken cha-shu in addition to omakase-a succulent onslaught of kara-age, chicken and duck tsukune, blistered shisito peppers, and soboro don.",1,1
638,Bar Boulud,French,3,"The restaurant that launched Chef Daniel Boulud's Upper West Side trifecta, Bar Boulud's first-class charcuterie and stellar wine list make it an idyllic prelude to any Lincoln Center show. Sit at the communal table with a hefty pour of a rare wine (ask about specials), and gaze at the tunnel-like dining room, crafted to mimic a barrel and clothed with Vik Muniz photographs of abstract wine spills. The wine-centric motif is as clear as the glassware. While their array of sips are winning, meat and cheese boards are equally worthy, thanks to the genius of Gilles Verot. He's responsible for the award-winning fromage de tête (bright and clean in flavor). The rest of the menu is as infallible and includes everything from Provençal rabbit to the Île flottante.",0,0
639,Maya,Mexican,2,"Upscale Mexican dining thrives at Chef Richard Sandoval's muy popular Maya. Slick with polished dark wood furnishings, vibrant tiled flooring, and accent walls the color of a ripe mango, this is always a fun scene. Adding to the revelry is the Tequileria, Maya's bar with a serious focus on agave spirits. Antojitos, such as squash blossom quesadillas and their trio of salsas, headline as starters. Tasty tacos are stuffed with smoked brisket and creamy chili slaw. Heartier dishes feature huitlacoche and wild mushroom enchiladas swathed in a creamy, fire-roasted poblano chile sauce. Especialidades like achiote-marinated carne asada with cactus-green bean salad and bacon-wrapped jalapeños display the kitchen's contemporary flair.",0,0
640,Boulud Sud,Mediterranean,3,"Far from a chichi French affair, Chef Daniel Boulud uses this ode to Mediterranean cuisine to explore all sides of the sea-from Morocco to Italy to Turkey and back again. Packed and lively, the dining room is airy with vaulted ceilings, natural lighting, and long striped banquettes. A semi-open kitchen allows a glimpse into the creation of deftly prepared delicacies. The menu here is light yet dense with bright flavor, from the crudo du jour (perhaps cubes of hamachi with gently braised cauliflower, pignoli, white raisins, and herbs) to a tender octopus salad with Marcona almonds, arugula, and Jerez vinegar. Huge morsels of chicken with cous cous, wilted greens, and preserved lemons make a hearty dish, attractively served in a classic tagine vessel.",0,0
641,Saraghina,Italian,2,"If you build it, they will come: and sure enough, from the moment Saraghina opened its doors to a just-burgeoning Bed-Stuy, diners have flooded this cool, multi-room, restaurant decorated in garage sale knickknacks, old butcher signs, and marmalade jars. It's downright adorable. But, it's the delicious food that fills the seats. Still best known for their irresistible pizzas, blistered to puffy perfection, the menu offers all kinds of heavenly dishes not to miss, like the fried calamari and shrimp, served with tangy lemon and aïoli; or a wood-fire roasted side of cauliflower mixed with creamy mascarpone, tart labneh cheese, and Marcona almonds. Just around the corner, at 433 Halsey, a sister bakery serves up fresh pastries and a mean espresso all day.",0,0
642,El Mio Cid,Spanish,2,"In contrast to popular tapas spots sweeping the city, this is an old-guard Iberian stalwart, deep in the heart of Bushwick. The interior bears a Mediterranean sensibility, with idyllic murals of the Spanish countryside, dark wood tables, and huge vessels of refreshing sangria. It has the feel of a relic from another time, when attentive service and a polished dining room were standard. Familiar flavors abound, as in sardinas a la plancha, two fat Portuguese sardines simply grilled and served with a wedge of lemon. The hearty paella Valenciana sees lobster claws, mussels, smoky chicken, chorizo, clams, and roasted peppers folded into a mound of sultry rice. For dessert, opt for torrejas, bread soaked in spiced red wine and served with vanilla ice cream.",0,0
643,Mominette,French,2,"Enter through the swinging wooden doors to discover that the less-than-glitzy surroundings seem a world away. Inside, Mominette's highly romanticized glow is impossible to ignore-picture wallpaper crafted from sepia-toned newspapers along with risqué photos of women amid vintage chandeliers. Add to that a familial staff and fantastic food...et voilà...a fun, energetic, instant favorite! There is a reason why each newcomer becomes a regular: the food is surprisingly delicious and very authentic. The menu focuses on classics like escargots deliciously baked with tomatoes and garlic; a fresh kerchief of puff pastry filled with tender roast duck infused with wine and tart cranberries; followed by braised pork tenderloin set atop nutty lentils.",0,0
644,Lincoln,Italian,4,"Beside the Lincoln Center's reflecting pool, with its Henry Moore ""Reclining figure"" sculpture, is a space dedicated to art of the culinary variety. With its striking glass frame, swooping turf-topped roof, and sophisticated Italian fare, it provides the ideal spot for pre- and post-show sustenance. The chefs perform in their display kitchen behind a glass screen, but instead of offering a generic menu they choose a different region each month and then showcase its specialities and best known ingredients. So come in, say, May and it could be Sardinia when you can have malloreddus as a pasta course or some mosciame with your linguine. The cooking is robust and generously proportioned, although the care and craftsmanship of previous years is no longer evident.",0,0
645,Faro,American,2,"The dining scene along this industrial corridor where East Williamsburg meets Bushwick is on fire-possibly spurred by the talented chefs who now call this area home. The husband-and-wife behind Faro have years of restaurant experience between them, so it's not surprising that this casual, dependable restaurant serves dishes carefully crafted from well-sourced ingredients. If the goal at Faro is comfort food with integrity, they more than succeed in this mission by pushing out dishes like sweet pea porridge studded with fresh morel mushrooms; and light, chewy gnocchi Sardi dotted with sweet ricotta, braised goat, artichokes, and tomatoes. Round out the repast with an ebony tangle of squid ink chitarra tossed with olive oil, roasted garlic, clams, and mussels.",0,0
646,Northeast Kingdom,American,2,"Deer camps and farming communities of Vermont inspire Northeast Kingdom's wonderfully playful food and seasonal menu. Vintage chairs surround bare tables beneath a wood planked ceiling in the pleasantly simple but tight dining room-still popular after all these years. The downstairs area has been transformed into a wine and cocktail bar. Parsnip, carrots, and tender chickpeas feature in a restorative bone soup of clear and beefy broth sprinkled with fresh herbs. A focus on rich, meaty flavors continues in the NEK burger, made with properly seasoned and grilled beef topped with onions, mushroom duxelles, and Vermont cheddar with a side of duck fat fries and tots. Chewy cavatelli is beautifully dressed with a lamb ragù enlivened by shiitakes and kale.",0,0
647,bún-ker,Vietnamese,1,"Located along an industrial stretch of Ridgewood, this charismatic Vietnamese restaurant doesn't offer much in the way of location-which is even more reason to suspect the throngs of people clamoring for it to open on a Saturday are here for something special. It's the food, of course, though the funky hipster surf shack interior and warm staff certainly add to the appeal. You really can't miss on bún-ker's menu, a whirlwind of Vietnamese dishes sporting a California-like freshness. But, highlights include the bang-on bánh xèo, a crispy crêpe featuring tender shrimp, bacon, bean sprouts, and fresh herbs; the excellent pho ga bobbing with tender poached chicken, chewy rice noodles, sprouts, lime, and jalapeño; or any of the mouthwatering daily specials.",0,0
648,L'Antagoniste,French,3,"From the razor-sharp service and charming décor (think elegantly set wood tables and banquettes), to the killer but traditional French menu, everything about this newbie in burgeoning Bed-Stuy is bang-on. The fact that it's surrounded by bodegas and a fast food joint simply adds to the overall intrigue. Owner Amadeus Broger also co-owns the popular Nolita restaurant, Le Philosophe, and here he relies on the same formula that made the latter such a hit: serious food in a fun, casual setting. Don't miss the soufflé au fromage, rendered light and frothy with nutty Comté; the tournedos Rossini, tender filet mignon over a potato pancake, topped with foie gras medallions and finished with Madeira; or the perfectly executed duck a l'orange.",0,0
649,Telepan,American,3,"There is a reason why we all wish that a Telepan would appear in our own neighborhood-this is among the city's most solid restaurants. With its brownstone charm firmly in place, the impeccable interior has an equally New York feel with cozy rooms, brick, and food-centric artwork decorating the light walls. Every element feels as though it is in smart proportion and lends an airy feel to the space, from the contemporary plates to the petite wood tables. The waitstaff is professional, not overly formal, and genuinely interested in each guest. Classic American elegance shines in a menu that effortlessly balances technique, ingredients, and flavor in perfect measure, while remaining creative and never predictable. Don't miss signature dishes like the lobster Bolognese, served as a whole tail or claws over a massive twirl of beautifully cooked spaghetti with finely chopped lobster meat in a light shallot-garlic-tomato broth that ensures the sauce melds with each bite. A gorgeous fillet of butter-poached turbot, which arrives alongside roasted winter squash made fragrant and sweet with allspice, is then finished with a decadent touch of caviar. The peanut butter and chocolate-gianduja crémeux is a perennial highlight.",1,1
650,Andanada,Spanish,3,"The ambience of this unselfconscious Spanish dynamo is vibrant and notably personable. Located just below street-level, Andanada is laid-back but still formal, with professional, customer-driven servers attending to your every whim. The crowd is lively yet sophisticated-whether seated at the date-friendly bar, pleasant glass atrium, or brick dining room decorated with memorable bullfighting scenes. Like its surrounds, this noteworthy cuisine arrives much more beautiful than expected-clearly there is modern talent in Chef Manuel Berganza's kitchen. While the chef's creative expression has been met with mixed results of late, each dish can at its best be composed with an eye on innovative cooking as well as classic flavors. Here, Catalan pork sausage is interestingly composed with shaved fennel and a fava bean casserole to elevate each bite. Then, pristine sardines are wrapped around pan con tomate and set over a bed of picada-style sauce for good flavor. Likewise, berenjenas asada is appealingly complex, served as cubed and puréed eggplant, balanced by a honey- and red wine-vinegar reduction. Simple-sounding mushroom croquettes combined with barely pickled mushrooms are gloriously earthy.",1,1
651,Bin 71,Italian,2,"An enoteca in the true sense of the term, Bin 71 focuses on vino with more than 30 varieties by the glass and over 60 by the bottle. A place to discover new blends and producers, this haunt is known to promote wine-focused conversation and amazing Italian-accented cuisine. An all-consuming U-shaped marble bar makes it easy-stay long enough and you're reaching for the menu. Beyond excellent cheese and charcuterie, dishes feature flavorful herbs that perfume a grilled chicken, which comes on a bed of sautéed spinach with white bean ragout and sweet-sour caponata. Basil-scented North Atlantic cod soup swarming with creamy, thinly sliced potatoes hits the spot, as does dessert-maybe a fanned-out poached pear served with a scoop of gianduja-hazelnut gelato?",0,0
652,Il Ristorante Rosi,Italian,3,"Madison Avenue has no shortage of shops, but none is more detrimental to your waistline (or wallet) than the Parmacotto salumi counter displayed at the front of Il Ristorante Rosi. Dare to indulge in more than just a snack? Venture further inside, and you'll be rewarded with a snazzy dining room complete with crimson walls, white leather furnishings, and frescoes and sculptures thrown in for dramatic effect. Start with a plate of that paper-thin salumi before moving on to enjoyable cooking that includes melanzane roasted until silky soft, capped by grated parmesan turned golden under the broiler, and plated with diced tomatoes and chickpea purée. Non-meat eaters will be happy to find porcini risotto or a satisfying cauliflower ""steak.""",0,0
653,Café Mingala,Burmese,1,"Café Mingala is a special destination-not simply because this is the only Burmese restaurant in all five boroughs. The cuisine itself is downright addictive and undeniably unique. This cross-cultural cuisine distills the flavors of Myanmar's neighbors-China, India, Thailand, and Malaysia-into its own luscious specialties. The pickled green tea leaf salad combines chopped lettuce, bean sprouts, peanuts, sesame seeds, and bits of tea leaf all dressed with spiced oil and fresh lime. Follow this with mo-goke pork, from the ""land of rubies"" made with tender chunks of meat braised in a salty and sweet dark sauce. Café Mingala's signature dish is a flaky ""thousand-layer"" pancake, or keema, topped with ground beef and potatoes in a turmeric-rich curry.",0,0
654,The Ribbon,American,3,"Eric and Bruce Bromberg, the talented brothers behind the city's Blue Ribbon empire, strike again-this time in an enormous, industrial-chic space featuring a bustling bar and long communal tables up front; and a handsome, light-filled dining room with a visible kitchen. The Ribbon's well-sourced menu is an ode to classic American dishes, with a fantastic rotating butcher's board; a tempting raw bar; and a roster of burger variations, including oxtail and mushroom. Don't miss the house-made cavatelli tossed with shredded chicken, creamy artichoke hearts, blistered cherry tomatoes, and tender wilted spinach. The juicy, spit-roasted Amish chicken marinated in sage and Riesling, and served with spicy mustard and crispy sage leaves, is yet another delight.",0,0
655,Sushi Sasabune,Japanese,4,"True, Sushi Sasabune has a drab dining room with service that is best described as efficient. That said, everyone comes for their omakase-only menu of pristine fish and skillfully prepared sushi, which deserves every ounce of its high praise. For those who don't already know the drill, abandon any idea of getting a spicy tuna roll-only truly authentic Japanese cuisine is served here. And it happens to be fantastic. The team sends out the finest from behind the counter and instructs you on exactly how to eat it, as in ""soy sauce"" or ""no soy sauce."" Cede control and delight in lean maguro drizzled with ponzu, kurodai nigiri sprinkled with crunchy sesame seeds, firm houbou brushed with hot ginger-soy sauce, and a creamy blue crab hand roll.",0,0
656,Persepolis,Persian,2,"Silky-smooth spreads, homemade yogurt, grilled meats, and fragrantly spiced stews have solidified Persepolis' reputation as one of the city's finest Persian restaurants. Linen-draped tables, spacious banquettes, and big windows facing Second Avenue fashion a look that inspires dressing up (or not). Service is always gracious, if at times earnest. The kitchen shines with its eggplant halim, a creamy, steaming roasted eggplant and onion dip with tender lentils and a dollop of yogurt on top. A kebab duo of saffron-tinged chicken and grilled beef are both succulent successes, served with basmati rice flecked with bits of sour cherry. For dessert, try the tart-sweet Persian lemon ice studded with bits of rice noodles and doused in deep red cherry syrup.",0,0
657,Andaz,Indian,2,"Simply stated, Andaz is one of the best Indian dining gems in the city's upper quarter. This demure space feels tidy and neutral beneath colorful ceiling pendants and wine shelves. A polite staff attends to the familiar coterie of neighborhood patrons. The menu specializes in regional dishes that are spiced to your desired level. Sample rich bowls of keema matar, a thick and meaty stew of minced lamb and sweet peas in a spicy curry paste of dried red chilies, ginger, coriander, and cloves. Hearty vegetarian options include paneer makhani, brimming with cubes of diced house-made cheese in a decadent cream and butter-enriched tomato sauce; or lusciously seasoned and distinctly tart vegetable vindaloo stocked with cauliflower, potatoes, and sweet carrots.",0,0
658,Tanoshi,Japanese,3,"For three seatings nightly Chef Toshio Oguma works his magic at this 10-seat, omakase-only Yorkville sushi haunt. The ocean's currents dictate the catch of the day, but here's what you can always expect as decreed by the chef: loosely formed body temperature rice and room temperature fish cured Edo-style. Tanoshi's pristine piscine selection will reveal an enticing bounty. Items can be as simple as a piece of deep ocean sea bream brushed with soy sauce and touched with sea salt, or as dressed up as a salt- and vinegar-cured branzini topped with sweet pickled white kelp and marinated cherry leaf. Five-second-poached Hokkaido sea scallops and salmon roe marinated for 48-hours in soy, honey, and sake may fall somewhere in between courses and are quite excellent.",0,0
659,FP Patisserie,French,2,"This enticing emporium marks Francois Payard's return to the Upper East Side, where sophisticated sweet-tooths can either grab a box of handmade chocolates or macarons to take home, or stay for an enjoyable meal in the salon de thé. Popular among the ladies, this petite room carries a sunny color scheme. Salads paired with freshly baked bread comprise their fine lighter fare; while heartier appetites will enjoy a choice of croque monsieur, or perhaps foie gras- and mushroom duxelles-stuffed chicken breast dressed with an intense mushroom jus. It goes without saying one must save room for dessert. Walk up to the sparkling display case and select any one of the fabulous creations, like the simply stated caramel tart for a salt-flecked piece of heaven.",0,0
660,Maison Kayser,French,2,"Maison Kayser is the US flagship of French baker extraordinaire Eric Kayser whose skill with flour and water has yielded him a collection of boulangeries that span the globe. Arrive to find a small retail area stocked with temptation and a bustling café that comforts guests in an oak-floored, mirror-paneled room staffed with servers sporting Breton tees. Get the ordering out of the way to speed up the arrival of the bread, made from organic New York-grown grain and studded with walnuts or dried fruit, rustically presented in a burlap sack. From the menu, enjoy the likes of shrimp- and lump crabmeat-topped guacamole; traditional boeuf Bourguignon presented in a cocotte; or pistachio éclair. All are worthy complements to the array of bread.",0,0
661,Caravaggio,Italian,3,"Nestled among Madison Avenue boutiques and commanding a rather formal air, this highbrow Italian dining room is a good reason to dress up and splurge. The slender setting is adorned with silk-lined walls, sleek leather seating, and evocative artwork. The well-dressed staff is serious, but their hospitality is genuine. The team of highly experienced co-chefs is equally intense in turning out their skilled cooking. Antipasti might include an elegant, warm octopus salad with baby artichoke and crispy potatoes, while heartier options may feature house-made cavatelli with jumbo crabmeat and sea urchin. Lunch offers a more pared-down experience, but a bowlful of velvety pasta e fagioli stocked with plump borlotti beans is a perfect post-shopping tonic.",0,0
662,J.G. Melon,American,1,"Posterity will remember J.G. Melon as a classic and coveted New York institution. Make your way into this cave set upon a cozy Upper East corner, where the timeless vibe and cheery staff make up most of its allure. Drinks are steadily churned out at a dark wood bar, so arrive early to avoid the hordes. The focus at this multi-generational saloon is the burger-perhaps paired with a lip-smacking Bloody Mary at brunch? The warm toasted bun topped with meat cooked on a griddle to rosy pink is coupled with onions, pickles, and crispy crinkle-cut fries. Be forewarned: you will go through the entire stack of napkins before finishing. Other simple pleasures include standards like salads, steaks, and eggs. Seal the meal with a chocolate chip-studded layer cake.",0,0
663,Mezzaluna,Italian,2,"Time and time again, this Italian idol hits the spot. Just take a look at the jubilant crowd huddled together at pink granite tables throughout the Euro-chic yet cozy room. One wall is yellow while another is completely lined with 77 depictions of the restaurant's name, beneath a sky-blue ceiling painted with clouds. Neighborhood residents and savvy tourists know Mezzaluna's unfussy Italian cooking is guaranteed to be delizioso. Take for example the veal Milanese-pounded thin and delicately crunchy, simply topped with peppery wild arugula and sliced cherry tomatoes. Other hits include pizzas that emerge from a wood-burning oven unceremoniously stationed in a corner, or beef carpaccio with a choice of toppings like artichokes and Parmigiano Reggiano.",0,0
664,Sushi Yasaka,Japanese,2,"There are no decorative distractions at this efficient if spare sushi-ya located a few steps below street level. The simple space offers three rows of tables, unadorned white walls, and a well-lit counter in the rear, and is warmed up by enthusiastic servers. Devoted customers know the draw here is not atmosphere, but the quality and excellent value omakase. Fish can be surprisingly luscious, especially the salmon, which has a remarkably clean finish and great salty note. The medium fatty tuna needs nothing more than a kiss of soy sauce. A 12-course omakase might also include giant clam, uni, sea eel, fluke, smelt roe, and for dessert, tamago. The kanto soba is excellent too, with a rich soy-bonito broth with scallions, seaweed, and a fish cake.",0,0
665,Boathouse Central Park,American,3,"The word ""touristy"" is mostly used pejoratively but there's no denying that sometimes visitors to the city know a good thing when they see one. Loeb Boathouse was built in 1954 and includes an outdoor bar and a restaurant whose glass wall folds away in the summer to give every table a great view of the lake. If you want to swap the chaos of the city and its cacophony of car horns for a couple of tranquil hours, then here's where to come. The menu is a mix of American and European classics alongside less successful dishes of a more innovative persuasion. Try the robustly seasoned linguine with Little Neck clams or Scottish salmon with chickpea purée. While brunch and lunch are year-long affairs, dinner is only served during warmer months.",0,0
666,Orsay,French,2,"With its mahogany paneling, hand-laid mosaic tiles, windows dressed with lacy café curtains, and pewter bar, this luxe brasserie is a painstakingly realized vision of art nouveau. Orsay proves its dedication to French tradition from the sidewalk seating to marble stairs leading up to a private room. Chef Antoine Camin's cheese soufflés sustain much of the well-dressed crowd here, but the classic menu brings much more. Soupe de poisson is a richly satisfying fusion of fish, tomatoes, fennel, and herbs; brook trout is presented à la Grenobloise with browned butter, capers, and finely diced croutons; and roasted pork tenderloin arrives with savoy cabbage, apples, and hard cider sauce. The soaked baba au rhum is as fine a rendition as any à Paris.",0,0
667,Café Boulud,French,4,"Taking its cue from classic French cuisine, Daniel Boulud's refined vision of food and beverage at the Surrey hotel is comprised of two spaces: the jewel box known as Bar Pleiades and this elegant, appealingly understated restaurant. Inside, ritzy residents and in-the-know globetrotters dine in a well-groomed, secluded room furnished with plush carpeting, rich wood accents, and mirrored surfaces. Sparkling elements atop beautifully laid tables set off the spot's conviviality, and gallant, smartly-dressed servers display unwavering competence in their presentation of uniquely constructed and superb tasting compositions. Under the watch of Chef Aaron Bludorn, the kitchen makes culinary decisions that never disappoint. Classically done poulet rôti showcases evenly moist, crispy skinned chicken finished with a fragrant tarragon jus, while the Crescent Farms Pekin duck, cooked to a perfect pink and sprinkled with coarse salt, is served with currant-studded kasha for wonderful depth in flavor and texture. For dessert, intricately layered crêpe cakes are garnished with rhubarb gelée and kissed with ricotta sorbet. And warm and springy madeleines-a house signature-send satisfied diners on their way.",1,1
668,Natural Tofu & Noodles,Korean,2,"This is the sort of place you've walked by a hundred times and never noticed. But it's time to look up, because the house-made tofu here is unrivaled. The space may be more functional than cozy, but this staff knows how to treat its customers, from happily adjusting a dish's spice level to presenting the bill with melon-flavored Haitai gum. They also clearly know the many secrets of tofu-the kitchen makes its own, then deploys it in a series of silken soondubu (soft bean curd stews) like the funky Korean favorite ""kimchi soft tofu."" The fragrant and rich ""seafood tofu"" arrives in a small cauldron of bubbling broth with steel tongs for serving oysters, shrimp, clams, mushrooms, and scallions with the most custardy tofu on this side of Queens Boulevard.",0,0
669,Atlantic Grill,Seafood,2,"This gorgeous Grill's sprawling patio is a seafood oasis in the midst of urban chaos. It seems deceivingly vast until you round the bend to a second, beachy dining room decked with a marble sushi counter and rattan chairs-a taste of tropicana on Third Avenue. Despite its name, Atlantic Grill pulls influence from the Pacific (think delicious yet unapologetically unauthentic sushi). Hints of sriracha and ginger keep things bright in bigeye tuna tartare, served in a glass jar glistening with sesame oil and avocado. Soft tacos filled with spicy shrimp and pineapple pico de gallo or red-miso Atlantic cod are filling and light at once. Brunch is a hit with twists on traditional fare. Some whine about the prices, but considering the neighborhood, hush up!",0,0
670,Jones Wood Foundry,Gastropub,2,"Jones Wood Foundry is a stateside take on a classic public house-the kind that Chef/partner Jason Hicks frequented during his childhood in England-that serves the same style of spot-on pub grub. The front bar is a choice spot to sip and savor from the selection of drafts. The space then opens up to a seating area of marble-topped tables, handsome button-tufted brown leather banquettes, and plush red velvet chairs. Beer-battered haddock and chips with tartar sauce, hearty meat pie of the day, and coronation chicken sandwich-the classic mid-century chicken salad dressed with intensely yellow, curry-tinged mayonnaise on toasted baguette-are a few of the true-blue hits. The vibe is charming, but dinner offers much more ambience than midday service.",0,0
671,Caffè Storico,Italian,2,"Gone are the days when museum food lacked character, and top Philadelphia restaurateur Stephen Starr's Caffè Storico proves it. Housed in the New York Historical Society, this marble-clad sparkler incorporates the collection into its design, with antique porcelain filling its sky-high shelves and views of the sculpture arcade. Starr certainly knows how to please a crowd with marvelous salads and Italian-inspired dishes alongside unique wines from some of the country's emerging regions. Though frittata del giorno pocked with red peppers, tomato, and mozzarella, as well as panzanella with creamy burrata are eye-poppingly good, save room for a berry crostata whose flaky crust is perfectly accompanied by a smidge of vanilla ice cream.",0,0
672,Salt & Fat,Contemporary,2,"An ode to the pleasures of the pig, this is the pleasantly casual and unpretentious home to Sunnyside-rasied Chef/owner Daniel Yi. Dark woods, playful pig motifs, and soft lighting decorate the simple space, known for its friendly, personal service Yet more renowned are the beloved bao and beer pairings that change frequently. Options may include the Cubano, served on a flattened bun and ready to be folded with a thick slice of smoky pork, mayo, mustard, pickles, and Swiss cheese, and matched with a smoky, malty local Porter, all for one affordable price. The Korean barbecue wraps are equally irresistible, with strips of spicy and funky marinated and grilled hanger steak, jalapeño, pickled daikon, and fried shallots combining in crisp Boston lettuce.",0,0
673,Uva,Italian,2,"Perpetually packed and always pleasing, this cousin of elegant Lusardi's is a rocking, rustic good time. Votive-filled nooks and fringed sconces cast a flattering light on the inviting room furnished with straw-seat chairs and wooden tables laden with wine bar-themed small plates. Cheeses, meats, and salads are fine ways to start. The insalata di manzo is a tasty hybrid of all three-shaved lean beef topped by peppery young arugula, shaved parmesan, and pickled mushrooms. Join the crowds at the start of the week for Meatball Mondays offering three courses revolving around...you guessed it. Sample the hearty beef meatball ravioli garnished with sliced artichoke hearts, silky smooth tomato sauce, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.",0,0
674,De Mole,Mexican,1,"If the words sweet, competent, clean, and authentic come to mind, you're most likely thinking of this heart-warming haunt for delightful Mexican. Albeit a tad small, with a second dining room in the back, rest assured that De Mole's flavors are mighty, both in their staples (burritos and tacos) and unique specials-seitan fajitas anyone? This delightful pearl rests on a corner of low-rise buildings where Woodside meets Sunnyside, yet far from the disharmony of Queens Boulevard. Fans gather here for hearty enchiladas verdes con pollo, corn tortillas smeared with tomatillo sauce and queso blanco. Crispy chicken taquitos are topped with rich sour cream; steamed corn tamales are surprisingly light but filled with flavor; and the namesake mole is a must.",0,0
675,Lusardi's,Italian,3,"With its pumpkin-colored walls, dark woodwork, and vintage posters, this beloved old-school mainstay offers a menu that relishes in decadant Northern Italian cooking. Picture an array of fresh pasta and veal, richly embellished with cream, authentic cheeses, or truffle-infused olive oil. The insalata bianca is a monotone-white yet delightfully refreshing composition of shaved fennel, sliced artichoke hearts, chopped endive, and slivered hearts of palm dressed with lemony vinaigrette and Parmigiano Reggiano, all singing with black pepper freshly ground tableside. Paccheri in salsa affumicata presents large pasta tubes draped with plum tomato sauce that has been enriched with creamy smoked mozzarella and strewn with bits of roasted eggplant.",0,0
676,Sushi of Gari,Japanese,4,"Great things come in unassuming packages-such is the case at Sushi of Gari, where the handsome, but decidedly unflashy décor belies a transporting omakase experience. Sold? A few insider tips from the regulars and you're on your way: make your reservation weeks in advance, as the dining room stays quite booked; score a seat only at the sushi counter, not just to enjoy those freshly scored slices of sushi straight from the chef's hand, but also because the congenial vibe at the bar surpasses the somewhat rushed experience at the tables; and do keep an eye on those prices, which can add up quicker than a trip to Target. Sushi of Gari is Chef Masatoshi ""Gari"" Sugio's flagship restaurant, and the legendary chef's trademark creativity and skill shine in spades here. A night indulging in his omakase might include delicately seared kanpachi, topped with a lightly poached quail egg; wildly fresh Japanese red snapper paired with pine nuts, bright greens, and fried lotus root; tender, seared toro with garlic and ginger sauce; or perfectly poached yellowtail, laced with sesame sauce and a sprinkle of chives. Sound too good to wait for a reservation? Sushi of Gari also offers a booming takeout service.",1,1
677,Shanghai Pavilion,Chinese,2,"Polished Shanghai Pavilion offers plenty of choice, but the slurp-inducing steamed juicy buns are what keeps the crowds returning time and again. Pay attention to the list of chef's picks, which should include firm chunks of grey sole braised in sweet rice wine sauce. This Shanghainese specialty is studded with crisp pea pods and plump goji berries for a memorable combination of subtle elements. Clean, simple flavors underscore every bit of the soft bean curd sheets tossed with fresh soybeans and pickled cabbage. Unique tastes are a highlight in ""Hang Zhou"" beef presented in a bamboo steamer lined with cabbage, topped with strips of tender beef and slivered green onions, dressed in soy sauce and spicy oil. Service is as upscale as the attractive room.",0,0
678,Tessa,Mediterranean,3,"An industrial-inspired enoteca, Tessa makes a huge, packed room feel intimate enough for a date-a feat in New York. A wine rack made of steel cables, metal security gates across the ceiling, and exposed brick complete the modern vineria look that is simply smart and very unique. Gorgeous French walnut boards holding cheese and salumi makes the food even more enticing. Pasta here can be at once luxurious and comforting, as in the cavatelli topped with rabbit and pancetta ragù with smoky-sweet cipollini. Grilled entrées may include a swordfish steak with a slightly tangy white wine-artichoke barigoule and citrusy caper gremolata. For dessert, don't miss the thick, cool coffee pot de crème topped with cardamom sablé and sweet date purée.",0,0
679,Café Frida,Mexican,2,"Margaritas and guacamole, the two tentpoles of any good Mexican restaurant, become the standard bearers for all others at this Columbus Avenue fiesta. Guests sample sips from the extensive tequila list at the intricately carved bar, or scoop up chipfuls of tart, chunky guacamole at tables throughout the bi-level space. Regional specialties on the frequently changing menu let diners explore beyond the typical Mexican dishes, though traditional enchiladas simmered in deep, earthy mole are hearty and pleasing. Meanwhile, succulent lamb shank marinated in a guajillo sauce, avocado leaf, and olives is tender enough to make steak knives superfluous. Flaming dessert plantains with ice cream replace the same old sopaipillas for a new hot-and-cold sensation.",0,0
680,Il Riccio,Italian,2,"Long-standing and low-key, this is just the right spot to recharge after an afternoon of perusing fabulous neighborhood boutiques or meandering through the nearby museums. Il Riccio has a cozy feel with warm ochre walls, simple furnishings, and an assemblage of photographs. Regulars know to head back to the enclosed garden to enjoy their meal. The cooking here is fuss-free, pasta-focused, and lovingly dedicated to the Amalfi Coast. Favored dishes include roasted red peppers topped with salty, marinated white anchovies; or fedelini primavera, a rustic presentation of thin pasta strands tossed with an assortment of fresh vegetables and well-seasoned tomato sauce. Grilled fish dressed simply with olive oil and lemon rounds out the menu.",0,0
681,Dovetail,American,3,"Serious but never pretentious, Dovetail is a well-frequented culinary destination. Don't be duped by its slight façade, as the seriously overhauled space within now feels much more spacious, ultra-warm, and very chic. Then consider the delightfully accommodating and well-orchestrated staff only to find that it all comes together in perfect harmony. Menus are handsomely bound in leather and highlight remarkably unique, ingredient-focused treats like a chickpea panisse coupled with garlicky aïoli; wedges of cool and tender chayote topped with crunchy pumpkin seeds and a creamy pumpkin purée; or king trumpet mushrooms coasting alongside paper-thin shavings of Asian pear, finished with an earthy and silky sunchoke paste. One large and plump potato raviolo, filled with creamy herb-flecked ricotta and floating in a pool of potato foam, is topped with a deep-fried sage leaf, which in turn makes for an ideal counterpoint to the rich layer beneath. Feeling self-righteous after such a wonderfully wholesome feast? You may look forward to some good old-fashioned decadence by way of a bittersweet chocolate soufflé-very light, delightfully frothy, and enriched with just the right dab of cardamom-cocoa nib ice cream.",1,1
682,Yefsi,Greek,2,"Chef Christos Christou brings a wealth of experience to the kitchen of this Yorkville standout. Having manned the stoves at some of the city's Greek stalwarts, the Cyprus-native knows his way around his Aegean and Mediterranean coastal specialties. Begin with salads showcasing superb feta or explore the array of luscious meze including zucchini and eggplant chips with tzatziki, octopus braised in mavrodafni or wine-spiked tomato sauce, and grilled sausages over black-eyed peas. Entrées entice with freshness and flavor, such as the wow-inducing nightly special of grilled tiger shrimp. Served head-on and lobster-like in size and texture, they are accompanied by a mound of creamy spinach rice and squeeze of fresh lemon-the perfect embellishment.",0,0
683,Mundo,International,2,"The Mediterranean hot spot that turned the city on to ""Red Sonja""-a popular Turkish dish of red lentil and bulgur wheat-has relocated to larger digs. Mundo's new space is tucked into Queens' trendy Paper Factory Hotel, and both are a stunning addition to this industrial stretch of Long Island City. The interior is now a sexy, bi-level affair, complete with a spiral staircase and lounge. Kick things off with the cuatro sabores, a medley of dips (think caramelized carrot or fava and dill) served with warm naan. Then move on to the Argentinian baked empanadas, with braised short ribs or Swiss chard and feta; feather-light Turkish meatballs, paired with spicy cilantro tzatziki; or the Egyptian artichoke ""Nile's Flower"" with a verdant dill-fava mousse.",0,0
684,Quatorze Bis,French,2,"Savoring a meal at this ever-lovely bistro is like taking a break from the constant evolution that is life in New York City, where tastes change faster than you can tweet. The red-lacquer façade, claret-velvet banquettes, and sophisticated clientele are all much the same as when Quatorze Bis opened almost 25 years ago. Though the ambience's timeless appeal is noteworthy, the traditional French cooking is their key to success. Frilly chicory, drizzled with hot bacon fat and red wine vinegar, and pocked with lardons, croutons, and shallots makes for a very hearty, très French salad. Seafood sausage is plump and studded with sweet red pepper and pine nuts. Daily specials keep the menu new, with dishes like striped bass served beside a creamy sorrel sauce.",0,0
685,Malagueta,Brazilian,2,"A longstanding spot for authentic Northeastern Brazilian fare, Malagueta's pop of color and spice stands out from its residential surroundings. From its personable and dedicated staff to the warm and unassuming setting, this culturally rich retreat keeps locals and destination diners returning to the tiny spot and settling into a bistro chair. The kitchen plays with smoky, sour, hot, and salty flavors stewed to mellowness to strike just the right balance. Even the humble arroz y feijao is a deeply satisfying blend of tender beans with pearly white rice. Picanha features grilled slices of sirloin topped with farofa (toasted manioc flour), enhanced by a citrus-herb vinaigrette, and accompanied by rice and beans. Finish with an excellent coconut flan.",0,0
686,Venturo Osteria & Wine Bar,Italian,2,"From the moment it opened its doors, this delicious osteria has amassed a loyal following of Italian food fiends in Queens. Original canvas paintings dress the Aegean-blue walls and distressed wood accents reinforce the calm Mediterranean vibe-even at peak times. Chef Michelle Vido helms a dedicated kitchen that surprises with excellence and generosity. House-made defines every dish, from freshly baked focaccia to the honey yogurt drizzled upon a lemon tart. Plump P.E.I. mussels in a fiery, serrano-tomato broth make for a great snack. But, for a fuller meal, try chewy ribbons of whole-wheat fettuccine tossed with hedgehog mushrooms, leeks, and pancetta; or a roasted leg of lamb stuffed with garlicky herbs over braised chickpeas and escarole.",0,0
687,Eli's Table,American,2,"Formerly known as Taste, Eli Zabar has redone the formal café located adjacent to his eponymous gourmet emporium. The facelift has revealed a more casual vibe-no tablecloths-but the scene is just about as casual as Upper East Siders can stomach. Inlaid geometric patterned flooring and an earthy palette remain, while a mural of the Côte d' Or is an attractive new touch signaling a more serious approach to wine. Rooftop greens as well as bread and gelato made in-house at the market factor into the revised menu that boasts a sunny disposition in its affection for the Mediterranean. Expect to enjoy pig's ear salad with a mustard vinaigrette, plump sardines over olive oil-smashed potatoes, or fresh pappardelle twirled with wild mushrooms and a bit of cream.",0,0
688,Cascabel Taqueria,Mexican,1,"Inexpensive tacos stuffed with skill and creativity are the reasons this taqueria has been a hit from the start. Highlights begin with the carnitas tacos, slow-roasted pork belly with chile de arbol piled high into two masa tortillas sprinkled with pickled onion, culantro, and the unorthodox but intriguing crunch from puffed rice. Other choices include burritos served with sweet potato fries, refreshing salads in crisp tostadas, and black beans with quinoa. Meals are presented on aluminum sheet pans emphasizing the laid-back vibe here. A caddy of salsas-roasted tomato, tomatillo, and very spicy diablo-tops and thrills each table. The corner location features a sunny room with exposed brick, bright green accent wall, and retro-style chrome chairs.",0,0
689,Lucky Eight,Chinese,1,"For an intimate alternative to the nearby Eighth Avenue banquet halls, this cozy restaurant is a reliable spot for Cantonese specialties from quick stir-fries to roasted meats. Beyond the bustling takeaway counter, turquoise fish tanks, and butchers at work, the mellow dining room houses small tables. English-speaking waiters can help maneuver through the menu against a soundtrack of clinking plates and bowls from the nearby kitchen. The expertly cooked noodle soups are a must-springy egg noodles swim in piping-hot chicken broth, studded with generous chunks of tender roasted duck. The roast barbecue pork platter contains juicy, thin layers of pork with just the right whisper of fat. Greens like choy sum are steamed to a vibrant emerald-green.",0,0
690,Beyoglu,Turkish,2,"Upper East Siders can't get enough of the meze at cheerful Beyoglu and its enticing Turkish, Greek, and Lebanese cooking. Vibrant flavors enhanced by garlic and herbs start with chilled platters loaded with hummus, mashed eggplant spread (patlican salatasi), and salads like kisir, tabbouleh made with cracked wheat. The only other thing you'll need to fully enjoy the Beyoglu experience is a bowl of strained, house-made yogurt. That flatbread is pulled straight from the hot oven only to arrive on your table seconds later, gratis and absolutely gratifying. Tile-topped tables and pistachio-green walls displaying painted flowers accent the interior. French doors separate the dining room from the sidewalk, but during warm weather both areas fill quickly.",0,0
691,Fishtag,Seafood,3,"Slightly below street level in a classic townhouse, this charming restaurant from Chef Michael Psilakis offers the pleasures of the sea plus Mediterranean-inspired cuisine. Grab a seat at the marble-topped bar among exposed brick walls and wood panels for dishes that may be simple (grilled fish with greens, tomatoes, and olives) or inventive (headcheese-stuffed trout). A modern Greek salad-tomato, cucumber, feta, olives, and grilled kale in a simple red wine vinaigrette-is a lovely start. Excellent bruschetta-like treats may bring an assortment of ingredients over sourdough bread, such as grilled prawns, tangy feta, and red chili peppers. Save room for sheep's milk dumplings with tomato fonduta, baby spinach, braised lamb, and white anchovies.",0,0
692,Arharn Thai,Thai,1,"Dishes burst with delightfully refreshing flavor here at Arharn Thai. The small space is bright and clean, arranged with glass-topped tables, decked with artifacts from the motherland, and equipped with two flat screen TVs. An organized kitchen spins out goodies like khaum jep: steamed dumplings stuffed with ground chicken, shrimp, crabmeat, and meaty mushrooms, served with a wonderfully sticky- garlicky- and salty-dipping sauce. The exquisitely tender gob kra prow (frog legs) are marinated and fried until golden, then cooked with garlic, chili peppers, onions, coconut milk, and Penang curry paste. Roasted eggplant arrives white, silky, and sublime, tossed in a light and vibrant salad of citrus-lime dressing, then crowned with flaky dried shrimp.",0,0
693,Spigolo,Italian,2,"This wildly popular trattoria has moved to a new address merely steps from its old location. Cozy and inviting, the larger setting offers a comfortable bar area and seating in a warm, modern room of knotty pine flooring, white stucco walls, and dark wood beams. This good-looker's founding husband-and-wife chef team are no longer involved, but the kitchen remains steady in the hands of Chef Joseph d'Angelo, who turns out classic cuisine with a Mediterranean accent. Slices of marinated fluke dabbed with lavender-hued Kalamata olive aïoli is a bracing crudo of the day. Starters include crunchy eggplant ""meatballs"" nestled in tomato sauce; while chewy cavatelli with shredded red wine-braised lamb is just one of the most heartwarming plates on offer.",0,0
694,Flex Mussels,Seafood,2,"Featuring a focused menu of cleverly made, high-quality seafood, it's no surprise that this mussels haven was an immediate success. Still going strong, this setting is routinely packed to the gills, both up front where there is a bar and dining counter, as well as the proper dining room in the back, adorned with an abundance of maritime-themed artwork. Expect to taste plenty of the namesake bivalve, hailing from Prince Edward Island. Priced by the pound and steamed in no fewer than twenty globally inspired broths, they are best with some killer hand-cut skinny fries. Mussels No. 23 refers to the nightly special, perhaps featuring a succulent bath of hot and sour soup bobbing with soft tofu, bits of pork, wood ear mushrooms, and dried red chili flakes.",0,0
695,The Simone,Contemporary,3,"Chef Chip Smith and wife Tina Vaughn prove hospitality isn't dead at their posh dining room, where genuine and forthcoming service-combined with excellent cuisine-has Upper East Siders giddy. The bonhomie present here sets the perfect tone for astute cooking typified by intricately composed plates. A savory tart to start boasts a shell of perfect house-made pâté feuilletée and is luxuriously filled with Gruyère, prosciutto, and a sunny-side up egg. Braised rabbit thigh-dusted with Dijon mustard-smacked breadcrumbs, grilled loin, and fried liver-is presented with pan-fried herbed spaetzle and bacon-wrapped prunes. For an old-fashioned finish, try the Lord Baltimore: a tower of Bourbon-soaked sponge, dried fruits, pecans, and torched soft meringue.",0,0
696,Momoya,Japanese,3,"A beguilingly simple aesthetic flows through handsome Momoya. The dining room is outfitted in floor-to-ceiling blonde wood, slate floors, and leather booths that exude a subdued masculinity. The front is dedicated to a bar where the drinks flow like a river and the sushi is always tasty. Appetizers here can be showstoppers, starting with small plates like piping-hot grilled shishitos with yuzu salt, black cod with spinach and kabocha purée, or grilled eggplant with sweet miso. The small sushi counter's strength lies in its creative maki, like a namesake roll combining shiso, cucumber, and ginger topped with beautifully grilled black cod, spicy miso, and sweet potato crisp. Sake offerings are balanced, smooth, and enjoyable to the very last sip.",0,0
697,Vai,Mediterranean,2,"Warm, cozy, and strikingly attractive, Vai is a casual yet sultry choice for tasty food and wine. The entire space seems to be illuminated by flickering votives bouncing light off cream-colored walls, brown leather seating, and bare wood tables. The small marble bar is superb for solo dining and offers the complete menu, as well as a full view into the hectic kitchen, where Chef Vincent Chirico is at the helm. On the menu, sample delightful dishes that focus on Mediterranean flavors, as in charred Portuguese octopus with watercress, crisp potato nuggets, and jalapeño ""pesto."" Then, move on to plump ravioli filled with silky burrata and sweet ricotta, dressed in truffle cream, topped with feathery parmigiano and cracked pepper, set over hon shimeji mushrooms.",0,0
698,Wa Jeal,Chinese,2,"This Sichuan chili house is not merely weathering the local torrent of Second Avenue subway construction; their spotless room and tasty food will make you forget that the outside world exists. The ambience is upscale and appealing, combining pale walls, prescient images of wicked-red chilies, an engaging staff, and a substantial wine list. The chef's specialties reveal the most noteworthy cooking, as in diced fish and crispy tofu stir-fried in a reddish-brown chili sauce speckled with chili seeds and sliced green onions. Sautéed chicken with spiced miso is another pleasure, mixing crisped, boneless pieces, wok-fried with roasted red chilies and charred jalapeños. Tender baby bok choy with garlic is a refreshing contrast to such potent flavors.",0,0
699,Pacificana,Chinese,2,"Among the best of the superior Chinese options in this far-flung pocket of Brooklyn, Pacificana is a bustling, airy second-floor jewel. After getting a number (which will be called out in Mandarin, Cantonese, and finally English) and waiting in the inevitable line, settle into a large, circular table along with other diners and prepare for a feast. The fun begins when silver dim sum carts start to roll by, hauling delicacies from the open kitchen. Service is curt as signature temptations such as plump pork dumplings and shrimp rice noodle rolls are plopped onto the table. Chicken with crunchy mustard greens, paired with preserved black beans and a steaming bowl of fluffy white rice is nothing short of heavenly so plan to linger here a while.",0,0
700,Donguri,Japanese,2,"This cozy Yorkville hideaway has endured years of non-stop construction along Second Avenue and a more recent change in ownership and chef. Yet Donguri still perseveres as a highly recommendable venue. Service has lightened up of late, reflected in the genuine smiles of the small and gracious crew, but the cuisine's ethos remains very much unaltered. Don't expect to dine on sushi here-there's more to Japanese cuisine after all as evidenced by their home-style cooked dishes. Nightly specials posted on the wall direct your attention to options like fried soft-shell crabs so pleasingly crispy and plump they don't need anything else. Okay, a squeeze of lemon if you must. Rice bowls topped with the likes of yellowtail and scallion are yet another specialty.",0,0
701,Tito Rad's Grill,Filipino,1,"This eclectic grill's move to bigger digs gives it that much more space to seduce with its innovative fusion yet hearty flavors. The new dining room, clad in rough white marble and dark wood, includes several cozy touches including a framed photo of the original Tito's and white butcher paper atop the tables. The décor is just the right balance between contemporary and familiar, one that perfectly encapsulates the unique Malay- Spanish- Chinese- and Japanese-inspired menu. Intensity abounds in every dish, from the fiery kick of the spicy laing taro leaves with pork and chicken, to the lechon kawali's crispy pork belly skin. If it's available, be sure to try the tortang dilis, a puffball-like torta that's stuffed with tiny silver anchovies called dulong.",0,0
702,S Prime,Steakhouse,4,"You can take the steakhouse out of Manhattan, but you can't take Manhattan out of the steakhouse. At this slick Astoria joint, beef rules and the same New York service applies: rough around the edges but not without its charm. Here, a neighborhood crowd packs into the loud bar and industrial-style dining room, toasting to another happy hour or date-night. While the menu offers some contemporary dishes beyond the classics, aficionados know to stick to the solid sides and aged cuts of meat. That ribeye is dry-aged with Himalayan sea salt onsite for 60 days, which results in heavily flavored beef that pairs excellently with classic accompaniments. Imagine traditionally prepared béarnaise sauce, creamy spinach, and a crispy pancake of grated hashbrowns.",0,0
703,Andre's Café,Eastern European,1,"A glass case displaying a decadent selection of traditional pastries-everything from savory meat pies to apple strudel and Sachertorte-greets and tempts guests entering this charming Hungarian café.

Standouts include a crisp cucumber salad, marinated in slightly sweetened vinegar and served ice-cold, and meaty stuffed cabbage, braised until silken and rustically presented in a pool of paprika-infused tomato broth.

704,Good Enough to Eat,American,2,"A mom-and-pop mainstay, Good Enough to Eat makes the most of its warm digs and those wide, stroller-friendly sidewalks of Columbus Avenue. Inside, the vibe is eternally homey and endearing with small, thoughtful touches like lots of cow art and a famously friendly staff, making this a primo stomping ground among residents. The food here is unconditionally good, with a daily rotation of down home dishes like roast turkey with gravy, cornbread stuffing, and cranberry relish.

705,Ristorante Morini,Italian,3,"Altamarea Group's prime Madison Avenue corner boasts a lively street-level lounge and second story window-lined dining room where even children in tow are properly attired for lunch. Despite the high-rent address, Ristorante Morini offers an economical lunch prix-fixe, a late-night pasta special early in the week, and family-style Sunday supper. Slick Italian dining is the draw here, as demonstrated by the likes of bigeye tuna crudo plated with pickled onions, nettle pesto, and fried salt-cured capers with a crouton-like crunch; or veal Milanese draped with prosciutto and melted fontina.

Servers charm with their thick, Italian accents and candles flicker on tightly packed, dark-wood tables. A rotating list of Italian cheeses and cured meats makes a fine appetizer and prelude to a pasta course that shifts with the seasons. Soft, light potato and spinach gnocchi are executed precisely, with mascarpone cheese, asparagus, and cherry tomatoes.

707,Cafe Sabarsky,Austrian,2,"This Museum Mile kaffeehaus is so authentic it may as well be set along Vienna's Ringstrasse. Instead, find in the Beaux Arts mansion-which is also home to Serge Sabarsky and Ronald Lauder's Neue Galerie rife with 20th century Austrian-cum-German art and design. Located across from Central Park, this gorgeous ground-floor den is clad in dark-stained wood with diners seated along a banquette covered in Otto Wagner fabric. Stunning cakes and pastries are displayed on a marble-topped sideboard. But first, order one of Chef Kurt Gutenbrunner's traditional specialties, including the city's best wiener schnitzel or hearty Hungarian beef goulash with creamy, herbed spätzle. When it's time for dessert, try a wedge of the chocolate, almond, and rum Sabarskytorte.",0,0
708,Gastroteca,Italian,2,"Astoria gets a much-needed jolt of rustic Italian cooking with Gastroteca, a charming new restaurant courtesy of Chef/owner John Parlatore. Tucked into a lovely corner location with enormous framed windows, exposed brick, and movies being projected onto the wall behind the bar, this is a fun spot but with a serious menu-the latter brought to life by a technically talented culinary team. The ingredient-driven menu offers a wonderful selection of crostini to start.

709,Maz Mezcal,Mexican,2,"This family-run, longtime haunt still draws its legion of neighborhood regulars for satisfying and traditional Mexican food. The front room is brightened by turquoise walls and quirkily decorated with watermelon-themed artwork; while the back room is warmer with its terra-cotta-colored backdrop. Welcomes are personalized, and the dining rooms are filled with guests chatting and quizzing the staff about their latest news. Chips and salsas are a crunchy and colorful precursor to Maz Mescal's commendable specialties. Family-friendly combination platters are a popular option, but a glimpse and whiff of the sizzling fajita platter might be all the enticement necessary to sway your decision. For dessert, brandy and Kahlua spike their take on the classic flan.",0,0
710,Mar's,Seafood,3,"Oh, Astoria, fine-you're finally the coolest kid on the culinary block. Mar's, a charming oyster bar plucked out of another century, is a good example of why: with its weathered seaside tavern décor, whitewashed walls, and curving bar, you'll feel dropped into a sun-bleached, turn-of-the-century photo. Most of the menu is given over to raw seafood and New England classics; part, to Mediterranean tavern small plates like sweetbreads and steak tartare. Kick things off with the excellent Mar's chowder, bobbing with briny clams, tender potatoes, bacon, and thyme. Then move on to the same sautéed sweetbreads with buttery fingerlings, pickled onion, and a swirl of balsamic reduction; or the house lobster roll kicked up with salty batons of Granny Smith apple.",0,0
711,Payag,Filipino,2,"Thoughtfully crafted with ingenuity and spirit, Payag is intended to feel like a home.

With bamboo touches and live Filipino music on the weekends, Payag strives to preserve a cultural identity both on and off the menu. The dishes showcase a regional approach to the multi-island nation's cuisine. National favorite kinilaw na isda, a sour ceviche of delicate white fish, ginger, and cucumber, is a refreshing start to the meal. Then move on to the beautiful bulalo, a tender beef shank specialty from Batangas, gently simmered in a broth with yellow corn, cabbage, and baby bok choy.",0,0
712,Petit Oven,French,2,"Unassuming but worth your attention, this little Bay Ridge site offers a petite, tidy room that is simply done and fills quickly. The ambience here brings a gracious welcome, and the air wears a palpable note of authenticity. Chef/owner Katarzyna Ploszaj styles her agreeable and refreshingly relaxed cuisine through a classic French lens. Appetizers may include a novel riff on Greek salad composed of thinly shaved Brussels sprouts mingled with diced feta, a handful of black olives, sliced red onion, and a sprig of fragrant oregano all licked with olive oil and a bright hit of lemon juice. Expect equally impressive entreés like a cooked duck breast, crisped and rosy, with red onion-ginger marmalade, and duck fat-roasted potatoes scented with thyme.",0,0
713,Barney Greengrass,Deli,1,"Bagels and bialys reign supreme in this culinary institution, set amid a culturally rich stretch dotted with lavish synagogues and purveyors of authentic deli delights. Not all are created equal, though, and little details make all the difference inside this sturgeon king, lauded for its weathered décor featuring muraled walls, a storied past, and service that is as authentically NY as can be. It's the sort of spot families flock to for brunch-imagine a triple-decker (tongue, turkey, and Swiss cheese) on rye paired with a pickle, of course. Whether you take-out or eat-in, chopped liver with caramelized onions and boiled egg is sure to sate. Finish with a perfect black-and-white cookie, rugelach, or rice pudding, Which are all favorites and fittingly so.",0,0
714,Bahari estiatorio,Greek,2,"Go hungry to Bahari estiatorio, a classic Greek-American restaurant where families gather for solid dishes with a hint of rusticity. Not trying to be anything more, the simple décor-featuring dozens of shutters hanging on bright blue walls-is refreshing rather than indifferent, as clear thought went into making the two open rooms feel embracing. Head straight to the Mageirefta portion of the menu, a collection of traditional casserole dishes showcased at the front the restaurant. Though pre-prepared, glorious kabobs and plates like gemista me kima-stuffed tomatoes with rice, herbs, and beef can make for an entire meal. Daily dessert specials like a custardy galaktoboureko pie provide the perfect ending to this big, fat, Greek feast.",0,0
715,Mimi's Hummus,Mediterranean,1,"Think meze and you have the right idea behind this heavenly destination for extra-delicious hummus. Though the space is teeny-tiny, a wise, thoughtful design and large windows ferrying swaths of natural light into the dining room make it very inviting. The open kitchen encourages a cheerful vibe and plenty of playful banter between the warm staff and upbeat patrons. Oven-hot pitas arrive ready for scooping up the rich, creamy hummus (a mix of chickpeas, tahini, onion, and cumin). A variety of garnishes are also available, including meaty mushrooms, which are a worthy companion to the silky signature dish. Pickles are a necessary side with an Iraqi sandwich stuffed with hardboiled egg, fried eggplant slices, boiled potato...and yes...more hummus.",0,0
716,Purple Yam,Asian,2,"Filipino food authorities Amy Besa and Romy Dorotan serve up a deliciously freewheeling array of Southeast Asian treats at this inviting café, named for their homeland's adored tuber. Located in lovely Ditmas Park, a neighborhood extoled for its Victorian homes, the interior charms with soothing colors and a view of the kitchen at work. Filipino favorites abound, as in chicken adobo-the bone-in pieces are browned and braised in a complex-tasting sauce of coconut sap vinegar, coconut milk, and soy sauce. Standouts might include pancit bihon made with rice vermicelli stir-fried with roast pork, bok choy, and bean sprouts. Other tasty options depart from the Philippines, such as sweetly spiced goat curry with fresh mango chutney.",0,0
717,Lea,Italian,2,"From its prime corner location with sidewalk seating to its all-glass façade, Lea is quite the looker. But its substance lives up to the pretty face, with a breezy vibe and eccentric accents like reclaimed wood and dismantled water tower segments that cover the ceiling. The food is an equally lovely collection of Italian dishes made with a degree of deference to the country's regional cuisines. Don't miss the expert cannelloni served Neapolitan-style: stuffed with ricotta and braised lamb, covered with a sensational ragù di pomodoro, and baked to the perfect texture in a wood-burning oven. On the lighter side, try the smartly made panzanella that pairs braised squid with root vegetables and a fragrant, herb-laced sheep's milk yogurt dressing.",0,0
718,The Farm on Adderley,American,2,"This hot spot perfectly exemplifies its diverse neighborhood, where eco-conscious residents refurbish old Victorian homes and support the most profitable food co-op in the city. Kid-friendly and cocktail-ready with rustic exposed brick walls, this farm-to-table respite creates seasonal dishes that are both delicious and healthy. Surprise yourself by digging into nourishing roasted spaghetti squash with aged goat feta and pumpkin seeds; or thinly pounded and crispy fried beef heart slices set atop a knoll of cheesy grits. Otherwise, stick to the classics with a poached farm egg over quinoa pocked with almonds. This ""Farm"" is so popular that it spun off the Sycamore and set up an expanded bakery on Church Ave., proffering a variety of loaves.",0,0
719,B. Café West,Belgian,2,"Discover a slice of Belgium at this Upper West charmer, where the space may be narrow and deep, but the front bar is always in full swing at happy hour. The dining room is slightly elevated and very warm thanks to cozy bistro-style tables covered in white linen, a pressed-tin ceiling, and beaming waiters. Posters and brass accents verge on cliché but all misgivings are pardoned upon tasting their fine and familiar favorites. Start with numerous moules options like delicious Malay laksa (red curry), Pamplona (chorizo), or red Duvel with hot sauce. Crunch your way through beer-battered fish and frites, before savoring a seafood ostendaise finished with shallots and cream. Gaufre de Bruxelles drizzled with chocolate sauce is fit for a Belgian queen.",0,0
720,Il Salumaio,Italian,1,"Yorkville residents have been doubly blessed by Fabio and Ciro Casella. First, their pizzeria San Matteo arrived on the scene with its wood-fired specialties. Now, the brothers bring more delightfully rustic fare by way of primo panini and pastas, to this underserved neighborhood. The slender space seats only a handful, but sidewalk tables increase the accommodations. Cured meats and imported cheeses temptingly stocked in a refrigerator display case are skillfully manifested atop luscious plates like the Arthur Avenue-basically a panino bursting with ham, salume, mortadellla, and provolone. The paccheri all'Amatriciana or fat tubes of perfectly cooked pasta in a thick tomato ragù seasoned with onion, pancetta and pecorino Romano, is a delight unto itself.",0,0
721,East Harbor Seafood Palace,Chinese,2,"Dim sum is a well-orchestrated dance at this boisterous hall, where small crowds wait for a spot at one of the large round tables for an indulgent weekend brunch. Steaming carts roll by and waiters ferry trays briskly into the red dining room with shiny gold accents. Service is quick but helpful; the constant clatter of chopsticks and rollicking groups are part of the fun. Eyes can guide the ordering when it comes to the dim sum carts, stocked with authentically prepared bites. Try the plump shrimp siu mai followed by rice noodles wrapped around crunchy whole shrimp and doused in a salty-sweet soy sauce. Snappy, stir-fried green beans are addictively crunchy. Don't miss the Singapore mei fun, a mound of vermicelli noodles with shrimp, pork, and scallions.",0,0
722,Parlor Steakhouse,Steakhouse,3,"Set amid subway construction, sexy Parlor Steakhouse has sadly remained under the radar. Boasting top-shelf Belgian and American beers as well as a clubby vibe, this unpretentious steakhouse seems to have it all...including space. Dine here-there's even elbow room for the classically large portions of high-quality beef. Meat really stands out as does the expert seasoning. Find evidence of this in hand-cut steak tartare, tossed with pickled onions, mustard, and gherkins topped with rye croutons. Served over sweet potato purée with smoked bacon and caramelized onions, the garlicky, herb-crusted Berkshire pork chop is a culmination of divine flavors. Cheesecake crowned with candied pecans and caramel sauce offers an extravagant yet excellent finale.",0,0
723,San Matteo,Italian,1,"This tiny pizzeria has made a big splash with its panuozzo, a regional specialty hailing from Campania that's a cross between a calzone and panino. The puffy plank of tender, salted dough emerges from San Matteo's hand-built, wood-fired oven crusty and smoke-infused before being sliced and stuffed with first-rate ingredients (highlights include the ortolano's fresh, house-made mozzarella, grilled eggplant, roasted sweet peppers, and baby arugula). The room is graciously attended to and perpetually crowded with neighborhood folks stuffing their faces. In addition to the appetizing house signature, other favorites feature fresh salads such as escarole with Gaeta olives, capers, and gorgonzola; Neapolitan-style pizza; or the day's special baked pasta.",0,0
724,Bamboo Garden,Chinese,1,"Brooklyn's Dyker Heights, a residential neighborhood in the southwest corner of the borough, is awash in delicious dim sum, but Bamboo Garden holds a special place in locals' hearts. An impressive display of roasted meats is the key differentiator of this bright and bustling gem that also proffers piping hot dim sum-and the servers are more than happy to explain their cart's content to newbies. Kick things off with the har gow, a tender quartet of dumplings stuffed with crunchy little rock shrimp; or the flaky, perfectly savory barbecue pork puffs. And, then move on to succulent barbecue pork, fanned over a bed of fluffy white rice with a drizzle of soy; or crispy pan-fried noodles with tender stir-fried beef, straw mushrooms, and Chinese greens.",0,0
725,Bodrum,Turkish,2,"Like the white sandy beaches of its namesake fishing village in Turkey, Bodrum has amassed a following of area residents, who stop in for a Mediterranean escape complete with well-made food. Although nearby storefronts lack polish, this retreat breaks the mold with attentive service and charming touches like a brick-covered, wood-burning oven surrounded by blue mosaic-tiled walls. Wines and spirits are straight out of Turkey, including the refreshing raki. Similarly, the menu leans towards classic plates with a few creative additions like pizza or braised leeks with rice. Regulars go for b'stila djej, a sweet-savory combo of cinnamon-scented chicken, almonds, and herbs wrapped in phyllo pastry; or stuffed cabbage filled with lamb, rice and dill.",0,0
726,Kaia,South African,2,"This South African wine bar takes its name from the word for shelter. It is owned by a native South African who chased her dreams of stardom to New York City, while building an impressive resume of work in some in the city's finer dining rooms. The space has a comfortable appeal, spotlighting a lively dining counter as well as high and low wood tables. Discover a plethora of wines not just from South Africa, but also South America and New York. To accompany your glass, select from the interesting small plates like ""spear and shield"" of bacon-wrapped asparagus with cheddar-stuffed mushroom caps; or vark ribbetjies en vark pensie, a pork duo of ribs glazed with honey and rooibos tea plus belly braised in Indian pale ale dressed with candied kumquats.",0,0
727,Park Asia,Chinese,1,"Park Asia's recent design overhaul is giving Dyker Heights' popular Dim Sum Row a jolt of style these days, wowing new and old customers with its floor-to-ceiling windows, soaring ceilings, sparkling chandelier, and light-flooding sky lights. If it all seems a bit showy for your average weekend dim sum rush, not to worry: Park Asia takes its food just as seriously. Servers are well-mannered and friendly, delivering delicious, well-executed Chinese dishes like plump shrimp paired with crispy bacon, as well as succulent minced beef wrapped in glutinous rice noodles and drizzled with a sweet-savory sauce. A pile of snappy choy sum is dusted with fried garlic chips; and warm fried crullers wrapped in rice noodles are topped with sweet soy for a saucy finish.",0,0
728,Houdini Kitchen Laboratory,Pizza,1,"Houdini's Kitchen Laboratory rests in an industrial neighborhood near Queens' massive cemeteries. But despite its character-less setting, the inventive restaurant more than lives up to its creative name. A large, airy space complete with an impressive cement dome oven, Houdini's whips up a small but selective menu of excellent pastas and unique pizzas with daily specials. The generous spirals of tagliatelle bathed in a meat ragù make for a very satisfying start. Sure, it's carb-heavy, but when in Rome-right? Follow that up with the popular, 18-month-old Monte Poro pecorino, or go all in with the sensational habanera pizza: crazy spicy peppers and strips of spicy pork loin in one fiery mozzarella- and tomato sauce-topped pie. Who says Queens isn't hot?",0,0
729,Brick Cafe,Mediterranean,2,"This neighborhood bijou is beloved for its big flavors and small, rustic space. From lace curtains and weathered floors, to a yellow façade with a ""stained"" glass pane, everything at Brick Cafe invokes the charming French countryside including its olive-tinted walls set beneath a hand-crafted tin ceiling. It's all very quaint to the point of being precious, but nonetheless appealing. To match a lovely wine list, the menu highlights such well-made items as cucumber salad tossed with tomatoes, olives, and yogurt; or specials like goat cheese and asparagus-stuffed chicken wrapped in speck, roasted until crisp, and poured with a parmesan cream set over mashed potatoes. Light and fluffy crêpes filled with berries offer the perfect end to such decadence.",0,0
730,Pachanga Patterson,Mexican,2,"This unassuming spot for tasty Mexican food with a twist has been a smash from the start. The vibe inside is always a feel-good one, with floor-to-ceiling windows, fairy lights, and quirky artifacts adorning the space. While the décor is subtle, the fuchsia-painted kitchen brims with bold flavors and superb textures as seen in soft tortillas folded with sweet grilled pineapple, spicy habanero salsa, and adobo-marinated shrimp. In a salad of red beets, salty crumbled cotija deliciously offsets those tangy chunks of pickled watermelon; and empanadas are a particular treat, filled with meaty portobellos and creamy potatoes. End with crispy sweetbreads con mole coloradito, redolent of cumin, guajillo, and chocolate, and find yourself thinking-dessert what?",0,0
731,Vesta Trattoria,Italian,2,"Astoria favorite, Vesta Trattoria, still attracts neighborhood foodies to its postage stamp-sized room-modestly dressed with sage-green banquettes-for a respectable wine list and ever-changing daily specials. Not only does this Italian idol walk the line between classic and contemporary cooking with seasonal ingredients, but it also boasts a wine on tap program. The extremely appetizing menu includes light bites like sugar snap peas tossed with brown butter yogurt. Keeping it in the ""pea"" family is a chilled English pea soup topped with spiced labneh, perfectly tailed by pappardelle laced with a luscious veal-and-tomato sauce and Grana Padano. It screams for more forkfuls, not unlike a spiced Baby Jesus Cake-light, spongy, and covered in caramel sauce.",0,0
732,Nick's,Pizza,1,"This Manhattan outpost of the Forest Hills original named for owner Nick Angelis is a cozy setup focused on the pizza station, where dexterous pizzaiolos work the gas-fired oven and put on a show. Despite the continuing construction along Second Avenue, a devoted following still seeks out this favored neighborhood pizzeria. Begin with the spinach salad slicked with hot bacon fat and red wine vinegar before enjoying a thin-crusted but tender and nicely chewy pie, decked with the likes of fennel sausage crumbles, crushed tomatoes, creamy mozzarella, and sweet basil. A delightful finish is Nick's signature cannoli, served as a freshly made pizzelle cookie filled upon order with satiny smooth sweetened ricotta and sprinkled with crushed pistachios.",0,0
733,Gennaro,Italian,2,"Despite its age, Gennaro hasn't lost its good looks or popularity-it still packs in hungry locals nightly, who aren't deterred by its borderline gritty surrounds or no-reservations policy. Come early or risk waiting, which isn't so bad considering the bar, whose by-the-glass offerings are vast and very appealing with both familiar and unusual Italian choices. The menu can be overwhelming considering its long list of pastas and daily specials, so trust your gut and you can't go wrong. Start with the polenta, served almost quattro stagione-style, with gorgonzola, prosciutto, and sliced portobellos; before twirling your taste buds around chewy bucatini showered with pecorino and pepper. The tiramisu is a light, creamy, and fluffy slam dunk.",0,0
734,Elizabeth's Neighborhood Table,American,2,"Picket fencing, a shingled veranda, and mullioned windows might seem more at home in New England than this relatively forgotten nook of the Upper West Side, but Elizabeth's pops out from the surroundings to embrace her warm and homey name. The décor follows suit with a butcher-block table, white wainscoting, dark walls, and wide, comfortable tables. The kitchen promises a focus on carefully sourced organic and biodynamic ingredients-the kind that Granny used. (Evidently, their foremothers had access to quinoa and excellent feta.) Cobb salad is a pitch-perfect combination of grilled chicken, bacon, blue cheese, and more in a creamy dressing. End with a seasonal crumble that is tart and cinnamon-sweet with apples, berries, and vanilla ice cream.",0,0
735,Engeline's,Filipino,1,"This may be the place for your local Filipino gossip. A breakfast, lunch, and dinner hangout for the area's growing Filipino population, this bakery-restaurant invites conviviality. A taste of the soft, flan-like cassava cake alone is worth the visit. Head to the well-maintained dining room for a more thorough introduction. Discerning just what's in each dish can prove challenging for novices, but find straightforward pleasure in the sarsiadong bangus, fried milkfish steaks simmered in garlic, tomatoes, green onion, a subtle yet flavorful fish sauce, and then topped with scrambled eggs. The chicharon bulaklak and the accompanying house-made suka (coconut-sugarcane vinegar steeped with bird chilies) gives quite the kick to sinfully crispy fried chicken skin.",0,0
736,Tanoreen,Middle Eastern,2,"One of the city's finest Middle Eastern experiences is tucked into an unassuming Bay Ridge corner and run by Chef/owner Rawia Bishara and her daughter. Meals graciously commence with pickled vegetables and za'atar-dusted flatbread and are followed by a tableful of unique plates brimming with flavors and colors. Turkish salad is actually a bright red tomato spread shot with harissa and dressed with bits of diced cucumber and a drizzle of excellent olive oil. Appetizers are numerous, but try to fit in the chicken fetti: an entrée of basmati rice pilaf studded with toasted, broken vermicelli and topped with spicy bits of chicken, slivered toasted almonds, a generous drizzle of yogurt-tahini sauce, and chopped parsley for a fresh, final note.",0,0
737,ABV,Gastropub,2,"This Americana gastropub's sophisticated cooking and no-nonsense mien are a perfect fit for its location straddling Carnegie Hill and East Harlem. Residents flock to the welcoming surrounds outfitted with tufted honey-tan leather banquettes and an open kitchen. Craft beers and small-producer wines comprise the beverage selection at ABV (alcohol by volume) and the menu is an impressively prepared lineup of seasonally skewed creations. Expect autumnal butternut squash cannelloni boasting local ricotta and pumpkin seed-marjoram pesto, or lip-smacking buttermilk-brined fried chicken with kimchi-cabbage slaw and crumbly cornbread topped with a melting pat of butter. A summertime offering of Frog Hollow peach sorbet headlines the short but sweet dessert choices.",0,0
738,Tre Otto,Italian,2,"East Harlem's favorite neighborhood trattoria has triumphantly returned following a move next door. Thanks to proprietors Louis and Lauren Cangiano, the popular surrounds-complete with cheery red walls, exposed brick, and penny-tile floors-are as cozy and welcoming as ever. Tre Otto's mouthwatering menu boasts home-style dishes made from recipes gathered over time. Antipasti include a luscious salad of shaved fennel and orange segments crowned by tender-grilled octopus drizzled with zesty salmoriglio sauce. Freshly made trenette pasta is twirled with pesto Trapanese, a divinely rich combination of tomatoes, almonds, garlic, and basil; while the flavors of pizza, topped with red onions, capers, and tuna, call Sicily's sparkling coastline to mind.",0,0
739,Beso,Spanish,2,"Well-located? Yes, just by the Richmond County Courthouse. Good food and helpful staff? Of course. Great for groups or solo diners? You know it. Beso seems to have it all, including an interior that spotlights quaint accents like beautiful antique sideboards. Grazing menus are all the rage, so it's worth exploring their vibrant tapas, which includes empanada de res stuffed with sautéed beef and served with a yucca-tomato sauce. Pan y cerdo or garlic-infused shredded roast pork slathered over a crostini and topped with melted Mahon along with avocado-pico de gallo is a savory treat, while bistek Cubano reveals a sherry wine- and garlic-marinated skirt steak grilled until tender and garnished with mojito sauce. Finish with a classic, ultra-smooth coconut flan.",0,0
740,Awadh,Indian,2,"Awadh isn't an ordinary Indian spot, but one that advertises faithful flavors from Uttar Pradesh. This Northern Indian region excels in low- and slow-cooked dum pukht dishes, and the menu reads like a study in authenticity (there's no tandoori chicken in sight). Even the small room, polished and modern, is ideal for the city's well-traveled locals. Top service and table settings further elevate the dining experience here that begins with aloo chutney pulao or basmati rice scattered with silky potatoes and spiced peas. Couple it with nali ki nihari (perfectly pink lamb in a creamy cardamom-infused curry) or khaas chicken korma rich with nuts for a profound and regal repast. Then cool down with minty pudina raita, and just like that, you've become a regular.",0,0
741,Basil Brick Oven Pizza,Italian,2,"In an area crying out for a reliable neighborhood Italian joint, Basil's was an instant hit upon opening. The tiny front room is dominated by a dome wood burning pizza oven, but down a long and narrow hallway there's a larger dining room with dark wood floors, exposed brick walls, and lantern-like light fixtures that is a cozy spot for devouring pizza or daily specials. Meals here must include thin-crust pizza crafted from well-salted dough. If you can look beyond the classic Margherita, the Napoletana with black olives or the salsiccia with caramelized onions both delight. Specials might reveal oven-roasted swordfish, tender and served with oven-roasted root vegetables. Thick, fluffy squares of tiramisu have earned their own loyal following.",0,0
742,Casa del Chef Bistro,Contemporary,2,"Heart, passion, and skill-this inviting bistro embodies the spirit of its dedicated owners. Chef Alfonso Zhicay earned his stripes at some of New York's finest, including Blue Hill at Stone Barns; his daughter is the one-woman show behind personal, warm service. In a cozy room with large glass windows, elegant (and often vegetable-driven) dishes comfort and surprise. The four-course prix-fixe is a remarkable value, perhaps beginning with a mushroom confit tart showcasing meaty strips of portobellos, mushroom purée, and truffle oil. Move on to savory pasta courses like orzo folded with seasonal vegetable ragout, topped with parmesan foam. Chocolate-hued braised short ribs sit among braised savoy cabbage, buttery potatoes, and a hit of citrus-horseradish.",0,0
743,The Pearl Room,Contemporary,2,"With its jumbo garden and bright, sun-streaked dining room, this Brooklyn steady is a solid choice year-round. Most days you'll catch a glimpse of the charming Chef/owner Anthony Rinaldi, working his magic both in the kitchen and out in the cozy dining room. Every meal begins with a bread basket, served with a creamy dip of cannellini beans, roasted red peppers, and garlic. The Pearl Room earns its reputation for a vast seafood spread (and generous portions) with dishes like pine nut-crusted lemon sole or lobster stuffed ravioli. Meat dishes are just as satisfying, so try the shell steak au poivre-a juicy cut paired with creamed spinach and a luscious potato gratin. End with tongue-wagging desserts, such as spiced carrot cake with a caramel drizzle.",0,0
744,Piccola Venezia,Italian,4,"This old-time idol deserves its landmark status as it has been going strong since opening in 1973. With Italian-American cooking so rampant in the city, it's wholly refreshing to happen upon a classic of such welcoming comfort. The décor is outdated, but white tablecloths are clean and crisp, and glasses gleam at the prospect of great wine varietals. With a trio of pasta, you needn't choose between fusi swirled in a grappa- mushroom- and Grana-sauce; squid ink taglierini; or maltagliati in a roasted tomato and basil sauce with a touch of cream. Spiedini alla Romana sees thick slabs of focaccia and mozzarella dredged and fried, served with an anchovy and caper sauce, and pork osso buco is of the falling-apart-tender variety-perfect with the velvety polenta.",0,0
745,Enoteca Maria,Italian,2,"No need to venture far on Staten Island for excellent Italian food-Enoteca Maria is just two blocks from the ferry terminal. With its Carrara marble and lively vibe, this tiny spot could easily be wedged into Greenwich Village. Thankfully, it's not-anywhere else its certain authenticity would be sacrificed. Each night, the menu changes depending on which nonna is presiding over the kitchen, as in Teresa from Sicily, who might serve an oxtail ragù or grilled artichokes glistening with excellent olive oil and a squeeze of lemon over spicy greens. Coniglio alla cacciatora arrives as diverse cuts of tender rabbit swimming in an inspired sauce of braised tomatoes, root vegetables, herbs, and a sweet-wine reduction with rosemary and garlic.",0,0
746,Sura,Thai,1,"Tucked in next to the Marrakech Hotel, Sura delivers a bright splash of Bangkok to this residential stretch. Colorful fabrics, mesh-covered lanterns, and ornate wood carvings give it an exotic vibe and support its mission to bring sparky Yaowarat cuisine to this locality's masses. A tad Americanized but completely delicious, here you will find tasty noodles, sour soups, and refreshing iced coffee. A terrific massaman curry with chicken, potatoes, and lotus root offers the perfectly balanced flavors and spice one expects in Thai cooking, blending lemongrass and Kaffir lime with sharp chilies and smooth coconut milk. Brunch is equally popular with such fantastic fusion items as marinated then grilled duck-and-scallion crêpes coupled with quenching mimosas.",0,0
747,Noche Mexicana II,Mexican,1,"If you had a Mexican tía, you'd want her to be one of the lovely chefs pounding masa and wrapping tamales at Noche Mexicana II. The tasty corner is dominated by two veranda doors that open onto the sidewalk-a perfect setting for the specialties this talented kitchen sends out routinely. Imagine huaraches con bistec topped with tender beef and teeming with refried beans, bright tomatoes, and sour cream. Those who venture uptown are not met with disappointment: tomate verde mole is accented with toasted pumpkin seeds and piquant chilies that cover the tender chicken; while brick-red chilate boasts plump shrimp swimming in a spicy guajillo broth with a sprinkling of cilantro and queso fresco. A fresh flan, the only dessert on the menu, is simply excellent.",0,0
748,Warique,Peruvian,2,"The façade may not seem to stand out against the neighborhood, but their food is straightforward delicious. Two narrow dining rooms flank the semi-visible kitchen at the heart of this restaurant, where the serious yet rib-sticking cuisine is prepared. The staff is helpful and welcoming. Warique knows how to please its guests with dishes that they come to savor time and again. Start with causa Peruana or cold, smashed potatoes dressed with mashed avocado, aji amarillo (a hellfire-breathing sauce), and then studded with shrimp. Or, try the papa rellena, a generous ensemble of potatoes stuffed with tender ground ribeye, chopped egg, raisins, olives, and a smattering of peppers. This may be accompanied by yet another aji crafted from jalapeños and black mint.",0,0
749,Sabry's,Seafood,2,"Among the hookah lounges of Astoria's Steinway St., Sabry's offers authentic Egyptian seafood and friendly service. A strictly Muslim (no alcohol) establishment, the focus here is on tradition-one bite of the complimentary hot, puffy, deliciously chewy, and totally enjoyable Egyptian pita with sesame dipping sauce proves the team attends to every detail. Take a seat near wood-framed doors that open to the street for people-watching, or by the open kitchen for chef-watching. Then, prepare for hearty items beginning with impossibly tender and smoky grilled octopus. An icebox labeled ""Day's Catch"" features a daily roster of whole fish, cooked-to-order and served with lemon and rice. Taojine with scallops laden in a fragrant tomato sauce is a savory thrill.",0,0
750,Eliá,Greek,2,"This sliver of Mykonos in Bay Ridge evokes the Greek island spirit with its white walls, baby-blue accents, and rustic wood-beamed ceilings. Choose between the charming backyard patio, the small bar, or a table surrounded by woven chairs. Then, tuck into a menu of Greek classics, beginning with the deliciously familiar flavors of spanakopita, elegantly presented as small triangles of buttery filo filled with earthy spinach, tender leeks, and a whisper of salty feta. Slightly charred and nicely crunchy grilled shrimp arrive on a bed of plump Israeli couscous tinted pink with pomegranate syrup. Crowd-pleasing options include house-made ravioli filled with shredded braised lamb. Rizogalo (rice pudding) is topped with preserved cherries and crunchy granola.",0,0
751,Zabb Elee,Thai,1,"This popular Isaan Thai restaurant, which focuses on hard-to-find Northeastern Thai fare, doesn't look like much from the simple façade. But once inside, you'll find a sweetly decorated space furnished with shiny metal tables that are in turn attended to by somewhat spaced out servers. The crowd here is mixed, and if you request your dinner be spiced authentically, they will indeed bring the heat. Unfortunately, the once spectacular menu has been reduced, and a few of the fan favorites no longer exist. Still, you can't miss with the yum moo krob, a delicious, crispy pork salad laced in a dressing featuring lime, fish sauce, crushed chilies, and scallion; or the larb ped, a lovely minced duck salad sporting pickled onions, Thai basil, and mint.",0,0
752,Gastronomia Culinaria,Italian,2,"From his experience in world-celebrated kitchens, Chef/owner Vincenzo Pezzilli has created this darling Italian restaurant that far exceeds the Big Apple's expectations. A native of Rome, he presides over his talented kitchen nightly, carefully watching over each sous as they transport authentic flavors to a dining room of locals and Ivy League professors. Paintings decorate exposed brick walls, and the soft lighting creates just the scene for satisfying dishes and Italian wines. Pastas induce swoons, especially the enticingly chewy strascinati alla norcina with garlicky pork and porcini bathed in a delectable vegetable ragù. To close, the tortino ai due cioccolati (dark chocolate cake filled with white chocolate) is absolutely worth the 20-minute wait.",0,0
753,San Rasa,Sri Lankan,1,"A little excursion to Staten Island is a must for knock-your-socks-off Sri Lankan food? Life is short, and honestly-so is that charming ferry ride, which deposits you on this local island destination for the best Sri Lankan food. Inside the bright, large dining space, you'll find wood accents and vessels lined up for their popular Sunday lunch buffet. San Rasa's food is prepared fresh to order, offering the perfect excuse to nurse a cold, salty lassi while you wait. Dinner may begin with a starter of string hoppers or crispy little pancakes laced in a rich fish curry carrying hints of clove, fennel, and cardamom; and then move on to the lampri, a succulent little bundle of beef curry wrapped in banana leaf with nutty yellow rice, eggplant, and cashews.",0,0
754,Himalayan Yak,Tibetan,2,"Broadly appealing yet truly unique, Himalayan Yak transports diners to a fantastical world of intricately carved wooden doors, mask-covered walls, and miniature stuffed yaks. It reflects an area of Central Asia where a hybrid cuisine of Nepalese, Tibetan, and Indian specialties rules. Lassi here is made from scratch and an absolute highlight of any meal. Start with an order of tender steamed dumplings filled with ground pork, scallions, cilantro, ginger, and cabbage. For an exotic array of tastes, try the phaparko dhendo combination platter with buckwheat flour roti used to scoop up Nepali-style goat curry; or dig into the mound of tse shogo ngopa (sautéed potatoes, spinach, mushrooms and bell pepper) with grated radish pickles and tart yogurt sauce.",0,0
755,Kopiaste Taverna,Greek,2,"While there's no dearth of Greek food in town, Cypriot cuisine is a singular treat. Tinged with Turkish and Syrian accents, delicacies are served with finesse and twists at this warm, comfy iteration of the tiny island. Make your way up the marble stairs (away from the jarring side of subway central) to arrive inside a room adorned with beautiful silk curtains, lush planters, and walls draped with traditional garb. If the ambience alone doesn't transport you to the Medi, your first bite most certainly will. The meze is a parade led by marinated olives, pantzaria, tzatziki, taramasalata, and hummus, which may be followed by morsels of meat from keftedes to koupepia. A starter of fried calamari is every bit as as obligatory as baklava to round out the meal.",0,0
756,Gregory's 26 Corner Taverna,Greek,2,"Judge a book by its cover and miss the rustic pleasures found within this old-fashioned Greek taverna. Disheveled charm fills the tiny two-room interior, festooned with Greek flags, bunches of artificial grapes, and framed countryside scenes. The bare tables are topped with butcher paper and the service is slow as molasses, but the cooking is honest and intensely flavorful. Begin with tirokafteri, a spicy, satisfying spread of thick feta blended with pickled red chili peppers and served with hot pita points. A stuffed green horn pepper might be next, over a bed of fried squash slices and a well of garlicky scordalia. The seafood combo offers the simple pleasures of stuffed clams, mussels, lobster, and shrimp with lots of butter, lemon, and parsley...Greek style!",0,0
757,Ornella,Italian,2,"Ornella and Giuseppe Viterale are always at home in their small and warm trattoria, settled in the middle of vibrant Astoria. The friendly service here includes Giuseppe swinging by tables and talking about the farmhouse event space he runs upstate. Ornella's orange-striped awning, stained glass sconces, and mural-lined walls give it a kitschy, fairy-tale feel that mirrors the Italian-American menu. Here, you'll find tasty and popular duck meatballs in an orange-brandy reduction (think duck à l'orange in Italian) or braised short ribs with Madeira sauce. For a filling treat, try the imbustata, pasta filled with ground veal, chicken mushroom, mascarpone, and a knob of mozzarella that's drenched in a chunky sauce of tomatoes, onions, and fresh basil.",0,0
758,Christos,Steakhouse,3,"This beloved Astoria steakhouse has a lot going for it, but its cause for celebration is that authentic Greek accent that imbues everything here. Excellent quality beef, as in the signature prime ""wedge"" for two, is dry-aged in-house, charbroiled to exact specification, and finished with sea salt and dried oregano. Vibrant starters and sides underscore the Aegean spirit at play with pan-fried vlahotyri cheese, charred octopus with roasted peppers and red wine dressing, and smoked feta mashed potatoes. Christos has a commanding presence on a quiet tree-shaded corner just off of bustling Ditmars Blvd. Mixing shades of brown, the cozy and elegant dining room has a separate bar area and is lined with fish tanks stocked with live lobsters.",0,0
759,Miss Mamie's Spoonbread Too,Southern,1,"Come to Miss Mamie's and plan to indulge, Southern style. This tiny institution recently got a makeover in the bright, clean dining room-think comfier wicker chairs, roomier tables, and lots of flowers. Despite its more sophisticated appearance, the kitchen still embraces such tried and true classics as fried chicken thighs with black-eyed peas and collard greens, Louisiana catfish, and a creamy red velvet cake for dessert. Grab a fresh-squeezed lemonade and dive into the sampler, stocked with deep-fried shrimp, fall-off-the-bone beef short ribs, more fried chicken, and probably too many sides of cornbread stuffing and hop 'n John. End with a cinnamon-scented coffee and start planning a stop by Miss Maude's, the second location in Hamilton Heights.",0,0
760,Ricardo Steakhouse,Steakhouse,2,"Walk up to the entrance of Ricardo Steakhouse on a Saturday night and don't be surprised to see imposing doormen focused on crowd control. Beloved by longtime locals, this place remains very popular for its genuine, ungentrified East Harlem vibe. Beyond its polished façade and wood-framed doors find small tables, eye-catching artwork, and on occasion, a formidable DJ. The menu combines whimsical wording and Latin influences with starters that range from empanadas or fried calamari to raw bar offerings. Heaping entrées (listed under ""Da Meats"") include the Ricardo Special, a grilled platter pairing tender skirt steak and a juicy pork chop with black beans, rice, and fried plantains. A few blocks north, Ricardo Ocean Grill is also satisfying crowds.",0,0
761,Ayada,Thai,2,"A bright green sign leads the way to little Ayada, where the décor's a bit plain but the food is anything but. Inside the popular Thai restaurant, guests are greeted with a smattering of tables; a simple, but homey setting; and a warm, family-focused staff to walk them through the menu. And what a menu it is, with dishes like the crispy catfish salad, paired with green mango and laced with a perfectly balanced lime dressing; a whole, deep-fried snapper, served with shredded green mango and tamarind sauce; a bowl of chewy drunken noodles sporting crisp green beans and tender chicken in a fragrant chili-garlic sauce; or fresh ripe mango and sticky rice, steamed to pearly, translucent perfection and carrying flavors of of sweetened coconut milk.",0,0
762,Samudra,Indian,1,"Excellent and affordable Southern Indian food arrives via this humble little gem in Jackson Heights. Guests are greeted by a long and simply decorated room laced with a few hand-woven textiles from India; and Samudra's owner (a personable presence when he's in-house) certainly adds to the cozy ambience by smiling and greeting guests upon entry. Of course, the real star of the show here is the vegetarian menu, which features 16 different kinds of dosas, including a perfectly crispy Mysore masala version stuffed with turmeric-tinged mashed potato. South Indian fermented dough specialties, like an idli-vada combo, arrive on a silver tray with sides of tangy tomato- and coconut-chutney-and is just another sample of the delicacies on offer here.",0,0
763,Agnanti,Greek,2,"Situated on a corner lot, this taverna offers stunning panoramas of midtown, the Queensboro Bridge, and Astoria Park; on sunny days, outdoor tables speckle the front area. The view alone sets this darling apart from the host of Greek restaurants that popularized Astoria as a dining destination. Yet the food offers its own view of Greek cuisine. Here, East meets West in a menu section reserved for Turkish classics with a unique spin, such as midia dolma or mussels with pine-nut studded rice. Other usual suspects also make an appearance including tzatziki with cucumber, lemon, and garlic-a marvelous accompaniment to zucchini-and-cheese croquettes. But don't fill up until you've sampled smoky swordfish kabobs basted with rosemary and lemon sauce.",0,0
764,Zum Stammtisch,German,2,"Family owned and operated since 1972, this unrelenting success story has expanded over the years and welcomed Stammtisch Pork Store & Imports next door. Zum Stammtisch hosts a crowded house in a Bavarian country inn setting where old-world flavor is relished with whole-hearted enthusiasm. The goulash is thick and hearty, stocked with potatoes and beans, but that's just for starters. Save room for sauerbraten, jägerschnitzel, or a platter of succulent grilled sausages that includes bratwurst, knockwurst, and hickory-smoked krainerwurst served with sauerkraut and potato salad. The Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte (classic Black Forest cake) layers dense chocolate sponge with Kirsch-soaked cherries and cream, and is absolutely worth the indulgence.",0,0

No one owns the modern Greek kitchen like this beloved author, chef, and local who manages to keep his food authentic and uniquely refined. And here he does it again, this time in a fun, tri-level space boasting a cool, industrial feel with wood paneling, iron chairs, and an impressive patio for warmer months.

766,HinoMaru Ramen,Japanese,2,"A trip to this Japanese ""tapas"" and ramen bar doesn't take much convincing. The simple spot forgoes fussy décor for a chalkboard menu, friendly service, and energetic open kitchen. Grab a Sapporo on tap or cold jasmine tea, and dig into a collection of small plates, including seriously crispy strips of pig ears; wonderfully juicy and spicy chicken wings (nagoya tebasaki); as well as buta kimchi-pork belly with sautéed kimchi and bonito flakes. The other real focus here is a big, slurp-worthy bowl of ramen. In addition to superbly traditional pork and miso stocks, HinoMaru also offers an excellent vegetarian ramen showcasing a soy milk base and teeming with carrots, ginger, and broccoli.

This beloved Greek spot has folks happily dining elbow to elbow in a tiny yet lively space where the bustling kitchen is in view and seafaring scenes paint the walls. Quick, straightforward servers may address you in Greek if you look the part-that's just how local it gets here. Grab a seat on the enclosed patio for some serenity and get things going with garlicky and bubbling hot crab-stuffed clams; or the cold, classic trio of powerful skordalia, cooling tzatziki, and briny taramosalata served with toasted pita triangles. Order a side of horta (steamed escarole and dandelion) to accompany a plate of sweet and delicate mullets, served with a side of lemon potatoes.",0,0
768,Trattoria L'incontro,Italian,2,"A litany of delights sets the stage for an entertaining evening at this beloved institution of Italian-American pleasure. Frescoes of tranquil Italian scenes adorn coral walls in the unfussy dining room, complete with white-clothed tables spread at an ample distance. Service is relaxed, professional, and even theatrical in their performance of reciting special upon special. Flavors are classic and robust, from eggplant rollatini stuffed with ricotta and herbs to the ravioli golosi, filled with both ground filet and veal, then topped with a sauce of mushrooms and sausage. Tender veal scaloppini is gently dredged and pan-fried, then bathed in a silky sauce of wine, butter, garlic, and lemon. Crunching through crisp cannoli is a divine finale.",0,0
769,Zoma,Ethiopian,1,"Smart, cool, modern, and always welcoming, Zoma may well be this city's most serious Ethiopian restaurant. The crowded bar emits a golden light from below to showcase its premium spirits, and the ambient dining room is filled with locals from this thriving community. Attention to detail is clear from the steaming hot towel for cleaning your hands to the carefully folded injera used for scooping up their chopped salads, chunky stews, and saucy vegetables. Unusual starters might include green lentils with a cold and crunchy mix of onions, jalapeños, ginger, white pepper, and mustard seeds. The doro watt-a chicken dish of the Amhara people-is a very traditional stew with a berbere sauce of sun-dried hot peppers and ground spices.",0,0
770,Kitchen 79,Thai,1,"Shiny black subway tiles and glowing fixtures set a date-worthy tone at this new Thai standout. Patient, helpful servers assist in exploring the menu, focused mainly on dishes of southern Thailand. Patrons can choose to be as adventurous as the sometimes familiar yet authentic and funky menu allows. Thick green curry (gaeng kiew warn) is packed with tender shrimp, bamboo shoots, eggplant, Chinese long beans, and holy basil simmered in coconut milk with pleasantly restrained spicing. A whole flounder (pla neung ma nao) is brilliant, distinct, and steamed to perfection with sour and spicy notes from garlic, minced ginger, and a Thai hot sauce. Flat noodles (ka nom jeen gang tai pla) with pumpkin, mackerel, and curry paste is a powerful, spicy dish.",0,0
771,Melba's,Southern,2,"A colorful spirit and Southern classics do much to remind guests of this quickly gentrifying area's flavor, culture, and past. Quaint and lovely Melba's is a place to gather and relax over good food and drinks, from Auntie B's mini-burgers slathered in smoky-sweet sauce to an absolutely perfect fruit cobbler-a golden brown and berry-licious height of the pantheon. Equally important is the swoon-inducing Southern-fried chicken: darkly bronzed, salty-sweet, and tender. Thick fillets of fresh flakey tilapia may be densely crusted with crushed pecans and topped in white gravy. Expect surprises here, from the spring rolls with black-eyed peas, collards, and red rice, to a complex Italian semillion (ideal for pairing with that fried chicken and waffles).",0,0
772,Community Food & Juice,American,2,"As part of Columbia University's sprawl, this address is a godsend for students, faculty, and locals from morning to night. Although it's spacious with plenty of outdoor options, the popular spot doesn't accept reservations-and has the lines to prove it. Executive Chef/partner Neil Kleinberg (also of downtown fave Clinton St. Baking Company) turns out joyful fare, and the weekly blueberry pancake special is just one reason why this place gets so much love. For lunch, a kale salad with artichoke hearts, pickled carrots, and crispy chickpeas is anything but rote. Come dinnertime, the fish or steak of the day has revealed pan-seared mahi-mahi with roasted cauliflower and black truffle beurre blanc, or grilled strip steak brushed with glistening teriyaki.",0,0
773,Paet Rio,Thai,1,"With so many Thai places around, it's easy to get lost in this exceptional concentration; just be sure to find yourself at Paet Rio. The design of this long and inviting room may elevate the experience, but it is their spicy and unusual cooking that makes everything shine. The menu here is a dance of sensations-tart, spicy, sour, fresh-as seen in Chinese broccoli leaves (miang kha-na) with pork, chilies, peanuts, garlic, and lime. Grilled squid (pla muek yang) has an addictive fiery sauce, while fermented pork and sticky rice sausage (sai krok Isan) is pleasurably sour with cabbage, chili, and peanuts. End this steamy affair over noodles sautéed with pork, squid, and soy sauce (kua gai); or khao phat pla kem featuring a tasty twist on the tired fried rice.",0,0
774,Dosa Garden,Indian,1,"The spicy, complex, and fragrant dosas of Dosa Garden make this casual stop a thoroughly impressive hidden gem. The ambience feels more storefront eatery than sit-down restaurant, with just a few hints of South Asian décor, but the warm, made-to-order dishes and aromas from the kitchen are transporting. The kitchen boasts a tandoor oven but also churns out an array of elaborate dosas, like the tantalizingly crisp Mysore masala served with a sour yogurt sauce, spread with spicy chutney, and folded with potatoes, peppercorns, curry leaves, chili, and cumin. Don't miss the unique rasa vada, crunchy lentil doughnuts soaked in a deliciously spicy rasam. Curries are amazingly delish, like the shockingly deep brown Chettinadu fish, accented with mustard seeds.",0,0

Run by the team behind El Paso, the slender space has been minimally re-touched but nevertheless feels cozy and inviting with its dark-stained wood furnishings and warm brown-shaded walls. The menu boasts house-made pastas like silken fettuccine treated to a soaking of Domenico sugo-a hearty amalgam of sweet fennel sausage, pan-fried spicy meatballs, and pork ragù in a bright tomato sauce.

Top off this confident cooking with a block of classic tiramisu that boasts an ample dusting of cocoa powder.",0,0

True-blue residents as well as those new to this evolving neighborhood crowd its affable rooms, where margaritas, ice-cold cerveza, and smiles flow freely. Stucco walls and decorative metal work grace the interior, while the covered back patio has a breezy mien. Tacos, quesadillas, and ceviche kick off cooking that hits all the right notes. Zesty guacamole is freshly mashed and served up in a molcajete with warm tortilla chips. Bold citrus- and tequila-braised carnitas Michoacanás are kissed by green chilies and crowningly paired with a bowl of hearty black beans and tender tortillas for wrapping. The silken flan offers a sweet finish.",0,0
777,Streetbird Rotisserie,Fusion,2,"Chef Marcus Samuelsson's latest Harlem hot spot is a funky corner devoted to slow-roasted chicken and old-school street-style. Wade through the boisterous, rum punch-fueled crowd and enter this party to find splashes of custom graffiti, eye-popping murals, and lighting fixtures made from cassette tapes, drum sets, and bicycle tires. Despite all this sensory overload, it is impossible not to notice the plump, auburn birds spinning in the glass-fronted oven. Tender, juicy, and exceptionally flavorful, they steal the show and are supported by the chef's signature mash-up of global flavors: green papaya salad, jasmine fried rice, and cornbread. Not feeling the poultry? Opt for the spicy piri-piri catfish with crispy shallots and avocado.",0,0
778,Nusara,Thai,2,"Tucked between an array of eateries and a sprawling supermarket, little Nusara's excellent Thai dishes make it a welcoming spot for a satisfying meal. The exterior looks more like a shop than a restaurant, but inside, the attractive yet simple décor and colorful sketches that line the walls are trumped by your dive into the extensive two-page menu. Begin with the pork strips soaked in fish sauce and lime marinade, deep-fried for perfect salty-sweet contrast, and served with a chili dipping sauce. The khao mon gai is a Thai take on Haianese chicken, where the remarkably tender and pale white meat is poached in ginger and rice wine, set over fragrant rice, and eaten with a spicy ginger-chili dipping sauce and a bowl of marvelous chicken broth.",0,0
779,The Cecil,International,2,"As evidenced by this buzzing hot spot, Harlem continues to prove it's a destination-worthy enclave for serious eats. Neon signage out front marks The Cecil's entrance and the lounge's provocative artwork gets things off to a sexy start once diners step inside. Dinner here is a trip around the globe, guided by a menu that spotlights Africa, Asia, South America, and the US South. Skillet-fried salmon, dusted with cornmeal for a satisfying crunch, comes plated atop spicy kimchi-inspired slaw; and the feijoada is a stoneware pot full of black beans, braised oxtail, and merguez garnished with slivered collard greens and orange segments. Even the wine list has a passport, with an impressive selection from black producers under the heading African Diaspora.",0,0
780,Sweet Yummy House,Chinese,2,"This tiny, impeccably clean dining room is drawing diners left and right to Elmhurst these days. But wait, you argue-isn't this just another Chinese joint along a stretch of Broadway filled with such Chinese joints? Not quite. In fact, Sweet Yummy House is a diamond in the rough for those hunting down authentic spice levels and Taiwanese specialties they've never heard of. A meal might kick off with a duo of sautéed cabbages, one cooked in a delicate Taiwanese style, the other in the Shanghai tradition, sporting fiery oil. Then move on to tender, crispy chicken and pickled turnips in a nose-twitching spicy sauce; before lingering over deep and dark cold jelly, rendered Chengdu-style, with slippery mung bean noodles and lip-numbing Sichuan peppercorns.",0,0
781,Vida,American,2,"All the locals love Vida, where popular Chef/owner Silva Popaz has created a cozy little restaurant with a firm commitment to simple, but well-executed, dishes. Inside the café-like atmosphere, you'll find unique artwork lining brightly painted walls, and a smattering of tables surrounding a long communal wood table in the center. The charming Popaz travels quite often, and the flavors she picks up along her journeys tend to make their way back into her menu at Vida.

782,Minton's,American,4,"This grand jazz club is the sister act to The Cecil, located next door. Don a jacket (as recommended for men) and settle into its throwback surroundings to feast and listen to the sweet sounds of live jazz. The art deco interior references Minton's 1938 opening, and black-and-white portraits pay homage to the legendary figures who have graced this stage. The only distraction from the music is the cooking: an updated take on Southern cuisine that's perfectly suited to this neighborhood haunt's debonair crowd. Smothered lobster and shrimp casserole is richly dressed with pimento cheese grits and crawfish gravy; while hoppin' John pilau, made with Carolina gold rice, fried black-eyed peas, and roasted red pepper purée, is like risotto with a down-home twist.",0,0
783,Uncle Zhou,Chinese,1,"Gifted cooks have been setting up in Elmhurst to show off their skills, but the chef/visionary of this modestly decked, massively popular Henanese gem has been a fixture from the start. Seat yourself inside the butterscotch-hued room, surrender to the affable staff, and await a memorable feast. Opening this culinary show are pickled cucumbers and briny bamboo shoots with mushrooms, followed by pan-seared lamb dumplings or hugely fortifying ""Dial oil"" noodles sautéed with dried red chilies. For the consummate finale, pre-order ""Taosibao,"" an impressive showpiece of rice-stuffed quail inside a squab, inside a chicken, inside a duck.

784,Taiwanese Gourmet,Chinese,1,"A truly local spot, Taiwanese Gourmet puts diners in the mood with its semi-open kitchen (a rarity for Chinese restaurants) and tasty food. Natural light floods the walls, which showcase an impressive collection of ancient warrior gear, all beautifully framed as if museum-ready. Menu descriptions are minimal but the staff is happy to elaborate. Excellent technique shines through the Taiwanese specialties, notably in strips of ""shredded beef"" sautéed in a dark, meaty paste, and tossed with dried tofu that balances complex flavors with fresh Chinese celery-a hands down winner on the menu. Likewise, the stir-fry of wonderfully briny clams and basil offers a perfect balance of sweet and salty flavors with oyster sauce, soy, rice wine, and red chilies.",0,0
785,Lakruwana,Sri Lankan,1,"Prepare for a sensory overload the moment you set foot into Lakruwana-the Sri Lankan hot spot is covered from floor-to-ceiling in murals, sculptures, flags, and more. The bright kaleidoscope of textures and colors is a welcome sight in an otherwise downtrodden part of the borough, as is the energetic owner who drifts from table to table. Those familiar with Indian food will love Lakruwana's abundance of curries, green chili-spiked kuttu roti, as well as refreshingly salty-and-sour lassi. But their flavorful fare is considerably spicier, packing heat into everything from fiery red chili lunu miris chutney to devilled chicken. Loaded with ginger and garlic, this stellar tomato-based chicken specialty comes with cooling raita and tangy vegetable curry.",0,0

Not only is it cozy, but the attractive slate-toned room etched in chalk with scenes of decanters and menu specials will augment your appetite. The semi-open kitchen in the back unveils such treasures as house-cured sardines with fiery piquillo peppers and crunchy croutons; or a salad of earthy golden and red beets mingled with yogurt, oranges, arugula, crunchy pistachios and tossed with a lemon vinaigrette. Herbs plucked from their copper planters may be featured in an impeccably grilled rosemary-marinated pork blade served with rich mashed potatoes; or desserts like citrus-glazed rosemary panna cotta bathed in chamomile grappa.",0,0

Marked by red awnings outside, the room is snug and cheerfully adorned with etched mirrors, gold accents, and splashes of rouge. The staff's French accents might hint of Paris, but the black-and-white prints on the walls return you to the landmarks of Manhattan. This kitchen's updated French bistro classics are universally pleasing. Enjoy thinly sliced endive tossed with walnuts and Roquefort cheese; followed by pan-seared duck breast with a cherry sauce and gratin Dauphinois; or hot and juicy grilled hanger steak with caramelized shallots, red wine reduction, and a heap of crispy shoestring frites. Desserts like the île flottante are traditional and spot-on.",0,0

The elegant, cream-colored space flaunts art dressed walls, a marble bar, and towering windows draped with silk. Looking to the north and to the south, the menu here delivers all-around gratification. Begin with insalata conca d'oro for a sparkling combination of shaved fennel, red onion, orange segments, and crushed black olives; perhaps followed by spaghetti di mare baked in parchment paper, loaded with squid, shrimp, and chopped tomato, plated tableside.

All this is the work of the Iadicicco family, who hail from Caserta, and have succeeded in creating an atmosphere akin to the osterie of their native Italy. The kitchen consistently spins out a short menu of favorites (plus daily specials) including large gnocchi alla Romana simply adorned with butter, parmesan, and sage.

On weekends, the eatery serves traditional desayuno, a gut-bursting feast of chanfainita beef stew, and other hearty favorites. Here, tamales are a broad and flat banana leaf wrapped and stuffed with chicken and olives-a tasty contrast to the familiar Meso-American counterpart. For ultimate comfort, go for the seco de cabrito, a fantastically tender lamb and aji panca stew served with chunks of cassava and extra sauce in a tiny clay kettle.

After those buttery biscuits, a decadent meal might continue with rich seven cheese macaroni, topped with crumbled bacon and parsley.

793,Flat Top,Contemporary,2,"Morningside Heights' scholarly set, already familiar with Jin Ramen, has been quick to adopt this bistro from the same team of partners. A mural of the Harlem Viaduct gives the low-key setting a sense of place, while friendly service accentuates the neighborly vibe. Global accents mark Flat Top's cuisine in starters like a caprese salad with burrata, or shrimp ceviche. Meanwhile entrées have included black pepper-flecked roasted chicken breast. The latter is presented sliced over steamed Yukon gold potatoes and a mouthwatering herb sauce made from puréed cilantro, roasted jalapeños, and hint of cream.

Other delicious offerings include small plates such as wood-fired radicchio paired with blistered cherry tomatoes and luscious burrata, all given a drizzling of vin cotto, as well as exceptional pastas like penne slicked with a ricotta-enriched tomato sauce hit with pepperoncini and fresh mint.

798,Bayou,Cajun,2,"Southern food isn't novel to the city, but Cajun cuisine on Staten Island is a whole new realm. Bayou delivers with its veritable setting and spread. The space is a bit bawdy with gold and green accents, but linen-covered tables, luminous mirrors, and chandeliers lend refinement. Live music on occasion also to the lure. Kitchen offerings begin with wonderfully decadent nachos featuring crawfish tails and crispy tortilla chips smothered in red beans, cheese, pico de gallo, and pickled jalapeños. Follow this up with a soul-satisfying and deliciously fragrant chicken-andouille sausage gumbo kicked up a notch with celery and peppers.

799,Bettolona,Italian,2,"Morningside Heights' darling gets high marks from Columbia University students for pasta and pizza. The little room is crowded with locals fueling up on delightful lasagna verdi, meaty linguine Bolognese, or the puffy, crusty delights that emerge from the wood-burning oven. The succulent array includes pizza affumicata spread with crushed tomato, fresh cherry tomatoes, smoked fresh mozzarella, and crumbles of sausage. The chicken breast Marsala is stuffed with spinach, fontina, mushrooms, and is a tasty example of their heartier cooking. Lodged under the elevated 1 train, Bettolona is inviting nonetheless with its closely arranged wood tables, brick walls, and rustic vibe. Baby sibling Coccola brings their signature pizza and panuozzo up to West Harlem.",0,0
800,Yuzu,Japanese,2,"Add sushi to Harlem's burgeoning lineup of eateries that are delighting residents and luring curious foodies uptown. The space is spare but fits in well within the sushi-ya archetype. An L-shaped counter and numerous tables compose the seating options in the room, which is painted pale yellow to reference the namesake citrus fruit. Yuzu's personable staff lends an amiable tone to the vibe. Chef Tomoyuki Hayashi has worked at the venerable Sushi Azabu, so expect to be pleased from start to finish. Sushi platters are a good show of skill, and may be composed of lean tuna, torched salmon, and unagi nigiri, plus well-constructed maki. Cooked options include cold and hot small plates such as yuzu- and miso-marinated seafood or grilled Bluefin tuna belly.",0,0
801,Maison Harlem,French,2,"A steady stream of locals, phone-toting tourists and City College academics filling these well-worn wooden tables proves that this bistro has little trouble attracting a crowd. Floor-to-ceiling windows, dark red banquettes, and quirky touches like vintage Gallic posters or football jerseys tacked to the walls lend a whiff of whimsy. Maison Harlem's menu plays around with culinary traditions, with results that may include a classic rendition of coq au vin with smoky lardons, browned button mushrooms, and fresh noodles to garnish the wine-braised chicken pieces. Sticking to tradition, ratatouille is a sunny bowlful of diced and stewed summer vegetables. The tarte Tatin layers thick but spoon-tender caramelized apple wedges over outrageously buttery pastry.\",0,0
802,Jin Ramen,Japanese,1,"All you really need to know is that this is the hands-down best ramen above 59th Street. Sure, decorative elements are simple, and it hardly matters that this little gem is hidden behind the 125th Street station's brick escalator. What comes from the kitchen deserves kudos. The menu is concise, offering a few items such as house-made gyoza for starters. These pan-fried shrimp dumplings have a delicate, crisped wrapper and arrive with sesame-seed flecked dipping sauce. Shio, shoyu, and miso ramen are all delightful, but the tonkatsu ramen is a special treat. The piping hot, almost creamy, mouthcoating distillation of pork bones is deliciously rich and stocked with fragrant chasu, pickled bamboo shoots, slivered green onion, and a soft-boiled egg.",0,0
803,Taci's Beyti,Turkish,2,"Find safety from the evil eye at Taci's Beyti, a bright Turkish spot tucked into a busy thoroughfare in Midwood, where smiling strangers chat at communal tables amid dozens of nazar boncugu amulets. Homey and cozy, families dig into rustic dishes as servers spring to and fro with platters of golden, fresh, fragrant food and pile tables high with pide, tabuli, grape leaves, and almond-stuffed apricots. Turkish options are few and far between in this predominately Orthodox neighborhood, and dishes here reflect this mergence of ethnicities, as in the unexpected but appealing combination of hummus topped with pastrami. Indulge in dishes that focus on vivid Aegean flavors, like the artichoke heart salad with potatoes and sweet peas (a meal unto itself).",0,0
804,Bin 5,Contemporary,2,"At this intimate bistro in Rosebank, dinner comes with a view of the twinkling Manhattan skyline. Complete with teardrop chandeliers, exposed brick, and a walled, outdoor garden, Bin 5's romantic setting has for long drawn locals seeking consistently good food and quiet conversation (plus that fantastic panorama!). The playful menu-complete with solid daily specials-ranges from the perfectly chilled crab martini to a ceviche of top-notch crabmeat, avocado, cilantro, and mango. Fluffy knobs of ricotta gnocchi are tossed with a sweet pear sauce, caramelized onions, and toasted pignoli nuts. Then, try the grilled pork loin, a truly fantastic dish which is cooked to medium, cut into three slices, and drizzled with a hoisin- ginger- and sweet chili-barbecue sauce.",0,0
805,Cheburechnaya,Central Asian,1,"This may be a kosher spot with no bagel in sight, but one look at its counter loaded with layers of bowl-shaped noni toki bread and you quickly realize that a meal here is a dining adventure. Specializing in Bukharian (Central Asian) cuisine, longstanding Cheburechnaya has been a neighborhood pioneer. The focused menu is more engrossing than the décor, and it's easy to want every cumin- and paprika-laced item on it. Bring your own vodka and start with the house specialty, chebureki, an empanada-like deep-fried wrap stuffed with either hand-cut lamb seasoned with cumin, chili, cilantro, and paprika; or fennel-sparked cabbage. It may serve as the perfect complement to smoky lamb fat, tender quail, veal heart, and seared beef sweetbread kebabs.",0,0
806,Dinosaur Bar-B-Que,Barbecue,2,"Huge, loud, and perpetually packed, this way west Harlem barbecue hall draws crowds from near and far. The bar area is rollicking, and for that reason kept separate from the dining quarters. There, wood beams and slats, swirling ceiling fans, and oxblood leather booths fashion a comfortable-and quieter-setting. The scent of wood smoke wafting through the red brick structure (which coincidentally once served as a meatpacking warehouse) only heightens the diners' carnivorous cravings. Minimize decision-making and order the Extreme Sampler: a heaping feast of apple cider-brined smoked chicken, dry-rubbed slow-smoked pork ribs, and lean Creekstone Farms brisket. Add on a creative side or two-perhaps the barbecue fried rice studded with bits of pulled pork?",0,0
807,J. Restaurant Chez Asta,North African,1,"Impressive in its authenticity, this Senegalese café is a rare bird in a neighborhood of vibrant dining choices. Meals here are exquisitely prepared and brim with unique flavors and scents, resulting in a truly transporting experience. Spotless and comfy, the dining room offers a clutch of wood tables sturdy enough to support the heaping portions of chicken yassa or lemon-marinated chicken cooked with onions; as well as souloukhou, fish and vegetables in a peanut sauce. For a true taste of the country's flavors, go with the thiebou djeun, a one pot wonder of broken rice infused with tomato and Scotch bonnet pepper. It's cooked with fish, cabbage, okra, and cassava, and speckled with xóoñ (those crusty, toothsome bits scraped from the bottom of the pan).",0,0
808,Ceetay,Asian,2,"Its location near Hunts Point and the burgeoning South Bronx art community may have put it on the foodie trail, but Ceetay has become known for inventive Asian cooking at its best. The open kitchen offers diners a view of the race among cooks cutting, washing, and packing up an endless number of takeout orders. The tiny dining room features Mason jar fixtures, a handcrafted bar, and a wall papered with yellowing Asian newspapers. Creative specials include a seared square of sesame-studded rice ""bruschetta"" topped with avocado purée, tuna tartare, and frizzled onions. Don't miss such highflying maki as the Kawasaki roll with a mishmash of crab, scallion, sweet glaze, and more. Traditional sushi here stands equally strong, with very nice maguro, ebi, and uni.",0,0
809,Il Poeta,Italian,2,"Queens is teeming with family-owned Italian restaurants dishing up the red sauce, and yet Il Poeta manages to carve out a unique place among its competitors by cooking real classics that locals can't help but enjoy. Perched on a quaint corner of Forest Hills, the refreshed décor is simple but elegant, with a suited staff and vibrant pieces of art lining the walls. Chef Mario di Chiara knows a thing-or ten-about Italian fare: you can't miss with items like cannelloni gratinati al profumo di tartufo, a homemade pasta plump with veal and carrot, baked in buttery béchamel, and kissed with truffle oil; or pollo spezzatino alla pizzaiola con salsiccia, a rustic chicken stewed in a light-as-air tomato sauce pocked with sweet porky sausage and roasted peppers.",0,0
810,Wafa,Middle Eastern,2,"One cannot know the sheer joy and passion that goes into homemade Lebanese food without a visit to Wafa. Nestled among the mom-and-pop shops of Forest Hills' main strip, this pocket-sized spot appears shy on décor but bold on authenticity. The smiling owner, Wafa Chami, runs the kitchen and her falafel still ranks among the best in town-these perfect orbs of chickpeas and ""secret Wafa spices"" are stuffed in a fluffy pita with hummus, pickled turnips, and har hot sauce. Primo specials range from stuffed eggplant and zucchini, to ground lamb steeped in garlicky tomato sauce. Meat pies sound pedestrian but should be sampled-these light-as-air flatbreads are topped with minced beef, sautéed with onions, tomatoes, and her infamous spice mix.",0,0
811,Mtskheta Café,Central Asian,1,"Deep in the heart of Brooklyn bordering Bath Beach, Mtskheta Café pumps out Georgian classics in a green-hued, faux-brick dining room complete with paper napkins, a campy jungle mural, and television looping foreign music videos. While the décor may lack, the service and food excel, setting this impossible-to-pronounce restaurant apart from the nearby bodegas and elevated subway tracks. Whether or not you can deduce what's on the Cyrillic menu, friendly servers standby, directing guests to native dishes like badrijani, an almost overwhelming helping of eggplant stuffed with fluffy walnut purée. It's light compared to the mutton bozbashi, though-a heady soup of tarragon, cilantro and lamb fat that adds a layer to any blustery day.",0,0
812,Mill Basin Kosher Delicatessen,Deli,2,"This middle-aged Brooklyn treasure is as old-school as it gets, and though it's a bit of a trek to Mill Basin, anyone looking for a real Jewish deli won't think twice. Part deli counter, part artsy dining room, and part party hall, Mark Schachner's beloved spot serves up all the classics from beef tongue sandwiches to gefilte fish. The wildly overstuffed sandwiches (all served with homemade pickles and coleslaw) are a home run, as in the pastrami, which is steamed not once but twice, leaving the meat juicy yet hardly fatty. Dive into a Rueben-an open-face and intense pile of juicy corned beef and tart sauerkraut on toasted rye bread, topped with Russian dressing. The pastrami eggroll is a serious, cultish favorite.",0,0
813,Parkside,Italian,3,"A veteran on the Corona dining scene, Parkside carries that old-fashioned kind of New York energy-back when waiters donned tuxedos, hosts boomed hello, and walls boasted classic photos of city elite. And though the neighborhood has changed much since Parkside first opened its doors, the fantastic Italian-American food they dole out stands the test of time. Join in the celebratory mood and make some new friends (no one really dines alone here) while tucking into tender ribbons of savory fettuccini Alfredo; tender veal pizzaiola laced with a delectable marinara; or cannoli freshly piped with ricotta and studded with candied fruit. The irresistible desserts are wheeled around to guests on a rolling tray, of course. Old school or no school, right?",0,0
814,Katsuno,Japanese,2,"To find Katsuno, look for the white lantern and those traditional noren curtains. Featuring less than ten tables, what this Japanese jewel lacks in size it makes up for in flavor and attitude. The owner's wife greets each guest at the door, while Chef Katsuyuki Seo dances around the miniscule kitchen crafting precise Japanese dishes from top-quality ingredients. His elegant plating of sashimi may reveal the likes of amberjack topped with a chiffonade of shiso, luxurious sea urchin, translucent squid crested with needle-thin yuzu zest, as well as supremely fresh fluke, tuna, and mackerel. Meanwhile, carb fans will enjoy a warm bowl of soba in duck broth with tender duck breast; or the fantastically brothy inaniwa udon, served only on special nights.",0,0
815,Danny Brown Wine Bar & Kitchen,Mediterranean,2,"Tucked within the enclave of Forest Hills, Chef Danny Brown's tony bistro proves that Manhattan and Brooklyn aren't the only boroughs worth dining in. Ever the consummate and creative professional, the chef and his team reward diners with a memorable experience and serious cuisine that never misses the mark. Inside, the well-appointed dining room bursts with conviviality as devoted fans line the bar and fill every table. The kitchen is on display in the back, allowing a view of the cadre of cooks at work as they prepare European-inspired cuisine that makes this space special. Roasted quail finished with bacon jus and a New York strip steak plated with potato strudel, creamed kale, and cumin-spiced carrots are just two enticing recommendations.",0,0
816,Mexicosina,Mexican,1,"The light-filled interior of this Mexican powerhouse sitting on a quiet corner is a busy amalgam of rustic artifacts, wolf taxidermy, and the Virgin in all her glory with flowers and votives at her feet. And those huge jars of jamaica, horchata, and the agua fresca del dia are just as tasty and refreshing as they are decorative. If they have the tlayuda, order it. Its crunchy paper-thin base is smothered in a veritable fiesta of refried black beans, chicharrón, lettuce, queso Oaxaca, crema and much, much more. Other equally terrific specials have included chivo, a rich goat stew in an intense habanero-spiked consommé, or tender and fatty lamb barbacoa tacos. Cold accompanying salsas are so divine one could skip the chips and just eat them-with a spoon.",0,0
817,Nick's Pizza,Pizza,1,"For all the historic touches and architectural details at Nick's Pizza, this 20-plus-year-old spot has the feel of a '50s diner that happens to live among the Tudor-style homes of Forest Hills. The clientele comes for the pie but also the cannolis, tartufo, and a caffè from the antique brass espresso machine. Wearing an old-school New York pizza attitude, Nick's shuttles pies to and from the oven at unbelievable speeds, keeping each table loaded. The terrific crust delivers a deliciously smoky flavor that's heightened by the crisp texture and any number of toppings-from salty anchovies to tender meatballs. The signature calzone is also worth a bite, with tangy mozzarella and ricotta oozing like slow lava and a cup of red sauce on the side for dipping.",0,0
818,Bocelli,Italian,3,"Tucked into a workaday shopping mall, Bocelli doesn't make much of an impression at first glance. But, make your way past the simple façade, and wow, behold a gorgeous sloping staircase as well as a vast, theatrical dining room with polished dark wood, stunning light fixtures, and well-spaced tables that are luxuriously set. Could the delicious looking Italian menu be just as special? The answer is most delightedly yes. An appetizer of spiedini alla Romana arrives topped with a delicious lemon, anchovy, and caper sauce; while a generous bowl of rigatoni ripieni alla Sangiovese is stuffed with savory beef tenderloin tips that have been braised in Sangiovese. At the end, a decadent chocolate three-layer cake gets a luscious hit from salty peanut butter.",0,0
819,Nargis Cafe,Central Asian,2,"This industrial strip is ground zero for Central Asian hot spots, where Nargis Cafe endures as a real treat. Composed of a front bar area and larger, brighter dining room, the entire space is brought together with marvelous Persian rugs and exotic pierced-metal sconces. Nargis hits a strong stride among the locals for its convivial vibe and unique repertoire of dishes that may include a bojon salad of smoky eggplant tossed with garlic, peppers, carrots, and cucumber. Kebabs are taken seriously here, so try the succulent lamb with chopped onion and dill. Uzbek plov studded with chickpeas, lamb, and raisins is simple but imperative. For dessert, the honey-sweet chak-chach is fried but surprisingly light and exquisitely indulgent.",0,0
820,Dojo Izakaya,Japanese,1,"If dinner in Tokyo isn't in the cards, make your way to this Alphabet City nook for the next best thing. Inside the izakaya, just large enough to accommodate you and a small entourage, black walls produce a vibe that's cozy, not claustrophobic, and gentle prices give way to bold flavors. The luscious array of pleasingly authentic cooked items on offer are best washed down by a cold beer or glass of sake. Highlights include kani korokke, temptingly gooey and creamy crabmeat-flecked croquettes; pork neck kushiyaki, slices of sweet, toothsome, fatty meat charred on a bamboo skewer and brushed with a savory glaze; as well as mentaiko onigiri, a grilled rice ball stuffed with spicy cod roe, dusted with sesame seeds, and wrapped in sheet of toasted nori.",0,0
821,Trattoria Romana da Vittorio,Italian,2,"This delicious Staten Island via Lazio trattoria serves up heaping platters of al dente pasta and irresistible nightly specials, alongside bubbling pizzas that roll out of its brick oven in the back. Owned and guided by local personality and beloved chef, Vittorio Asoli (his cooking classes are televised on a local community channel), Trattoria Romana da Vittorio offers a cozy reprieve from the busy avenue outside, with diners huddling over snug tables or gathering at a communal table to chat up their neighbors. Don't miss the juicy chicken scarpariello, caramelized to perfection and simmered in a delicate white wine sauce with rosemary and garlic; or tender trippa alla Romana, served in a fresh tomato sauce with a hunk of crusty bread for dipping.",0,0
822,Crazy Crab 888,Burmese,2,"You may second-guess your arrival to Crazy Crab 888 when you see the tarred-over landscape and auto body shops, but one step inside this downright delicious gem dispels any and all reservations. A sort of Burmese-Chinese seafood shack with influences from India and Thailand, the food offers recognizable ingredients in creative combos worthy of its wacky title-in Chinese culture, the number 8 is known to bring much good luck. The pickled ginger salad packs a punch-crunch of fried garlic with cilantro, and makes for a cooling lead into the seafood 888 platter of Dungeness crab and crawfish-complete with a bib! For more spice, Yunnan sliced pork, straight from the face of a pig, combines fleshy meat with peanuts and chilies for a funky, must-try delight.",0,0
823,Asian Jewels,Seafood,2,"Arguably the best dim sum in Flushing, this spectacular gem is an absolute must for anyone seeking serious seafood and very authentic Cantonese cooking. A longtime resident of 39th Avenue, the expansive dining room is outfitted with round, banquet-style tables, bamboo plants, and ornate chandeliers. Let the feasting begin with memorable crab-and-pork soup dumplings, before moving on to the thrill-inducing dim sum carts. Taste the likes of steamed rice rolls with honey-roast pork; pork spareribs with rice starch and black beans; chicken and ham wrapped in yuba; and poached jellyfish with scallions and sesame. The signature Dungeness crab-steamed and stir-fried with ginger and green onions, served with Japanese eggplant and garlic-is simply outstanding.",0,0
824,Marcha Cocina,Latin American,2,"Colors evoke the Caribbean at Marcha, a narrow restaurant known for authentic Spanish tapas. A long bar dominates the sea-blue and sunny-yellow room filled with high tables and a convivial crowd. The music is a touch loud, the service is refreshingly down-to-earth, and the food impresses beyond what its neighborhood bar-vibe might suggest. The menu is broad and affordable, which makes a perfect excuse to sample widely. Staples from tender tortilla Espanola to gambas al ajillo are delicious executions of classic tapas. Ribbons of luscious Spanish ham are on handsome display in the hongos e higos coca, a chewy flatbread also topped with mushrooms, figs, and buttery almonds. It would be blasphemy to skip the dates wrapped in bacon or the thick-cut yucca fries.",0,0
825,Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao,Chinese,1,"Also known as Nan Xiang Dumpling House, it is easily found among a strip of restaurants reflecting the diversity of Flushing's dominant Asian population. Simply decorated, the comfortable dining room features rows of closely set tables and a mirrored wall that successfully gives the illusion of space. The enjoyable and interesting menu focuses on noodle-filled soups, toothsome stir-fried rice cakes, and the house specialty, juicy dumplings. These are made in-house and have a delicate, silky wrapper encasing a flavorful meatball of ground pork or crab with rich tasting broth. Eating the specialties may take some practice, but take your cue from the slurping crowd: puncture the casing on your spoon to cool the dumplings and avoid scalding your mouth.",0,0
826,Iki Japanese,Japanese,3,"This upscale Japanese restaurant tucked into the newly constructed Hyatt Place Hotel is a lovely addition to the Queens dining scene. Duck inside the modern glass façade and you're greeted with curving leather booths; thick wood tables; and beautiful blonde flooring. You've seen this before, you think to yourself, but only in Brooklyn or Manhattan. This is Queens in high heels. Diners can opt for traditional omakase or à la carte: the former might begin with silky house-made tofu, topped with caviar and cool dashi. Then move on to a fresh Dungeness crab salad with yuzu jelly and crab roe; soft shell crab and zucchini flower tempura; soft Wagyu carpaccio dusted with sea salt and truffles; or a bright, rainbow-assortment of fresh sushi.",0,0
827,Little Pepper,Chinese,1,"Set on an ordinary block of residences and businesses is Little Pepper, a tiny yet extraordinary rendition of Sichuan cooking. The room wears a delicate vibe with hand-painted murals, marble-tiled floors, and a cozy service bar. But, the real focus remains on the food, which is honest, bold, and always on-point. Sample soft and yielding mapo tofu, sweet with minced pork, fiery with chilies, and smoky with ground peppercorns sinking into a thick, oily gravy; or shredded pork tossed with potato strands and pickled cabbage to truly appreciate their excellent (if occasionally) underrated food. Pine nuts sautéed with corn and snow pea leaves are marvelous for mellow palates, while chicken stir-fried with dried red chilies is a hit among those on a spice trip.",0,0
828,Main Street Imperial Taiwanese Gourmet,Chinese,1,"It's a real journey to this Taiwanese treasure-not only in its trek from the closest subway stop, but more importantly, in the experience. Here, the staff speaks their mother tongue for the most part, incense wafts from an altar, and the food is otherworldly. Dishes present dazzling, authentic flavors, easily savored in the peaceful atmosphere. Sweet, head-on shrimp arrive steamed and still in the shell, housing juice that accentuates the concentrated flavor when dipped in soy sauce. Likewise, the stinky tofu (a traditional delicacy) gets its flavor from a light sauté and a finish of kimchi-style pickles. And if you're any sort of fan of the famed oyster pancake, this outstanding version will remain in your memory long after the lengthy ride home.",0,0
829,Carol's Cafe,American,2,"Dining here is like dining in Chef/owner Carol Frazzetta's kitchen-almost literally, because she lives on the premises. Her delightful personality fills the space, from the fresh flowers and pink linens, to shareable dishes and that homemade chocolate stout triple layer cake. Not only has Frazzetta owned the building since the 1970s, but she clearly knows her neighbors, many of whom flock to the café for a roster of daily specials (top hits include ""wild game of the day"" like grilled buffalo ribeye and a marvelous prosciutto- and tomato-stuffed bread). The chef's slow-cooked spaghetti al pomodoro is another fan fave, topped with a chiffonade of basil and peppered with parmesan, before serving. Like everything else, it's simple, well-made, and delizioso.",0,0
830,Happy Family Hotpot,Chinese,1,"You'll think you've died and gone to Hong Kong. Every table at this popular Flushing hot pot spot is fitted out with iPads and a square cooker, and the interior is ultra sleek. Think tufted white leather walls and flat-screen televisions dangling over the tables. It's a stylish place to cool your heels but the real star of the show exists within the kitchen's authentic hot pot selection-pork brain, anyone? You can build your own, choosing from 70+ dunkables like tender pork belly that cooks in a flash; paper-thin taro root; tender baby greens; flavorful head-on shrimp; or chewy udon noodles. From there, choose either the mild white broth or an irresistibly spicy red one bobbing with peppercorns. Better yet, get both, also known as a half and half.",0,0
831,Dumpling Galaxy,Chinese,1,"Neon bounces off all the new, shiny surfaces at Dumpling Galaxy, inside the Arcadia Mall. Navigate beyond the phone retailers and stalls to find this huge, modern space full of red booths and hanging red lights. Spiffy and inviting, the newcomer is already lauded for crafting scores of dumpling variations, plus comforting entrées that shouldn't be ignored. Fill your table with a dumpling feast, stuffed chock-full of duck and mushroom, spicy-sour squash, or lamb and celery redolent of lemongrass and spices. Larger dishes are equally memorable; those cold, thick, slurp-inducing green bean noodles soaked in heady, tart black vinegar with raw white sesame seeds, cilantro, cucumbers, and wood-ear mushrooms will have you coming back for more...and then some more.",0,0
832,Biáng!,Chinese,2,"Biáng! isn't exotic by accident. In fact, Chef/owner Jason Wang's cuisine interplays contrasts and textures with the intention to excite. Tucked into Flushing's main artery, the setting is boisterous and tables are busy, but shabby-chic details like a plate-glass exterior are the first sign that you're in for an unencumbered and unique treat. Dark walls and floors cover the inside, but gentle lighting and lofty ceilings add dimension to the narrow space. Strong flavors and fiery oils star in dishes like crispy lotus root tossed in an earthy sesame vinaigrette; fresh buckwheat noodles mingled with cucumber, soy, and mustard oil; and chang, hot, creamy tofu with pickled vegetables. Lamb burgers seasoned with jalapeños and cumin are a fitting signature.",0,0
833,Lu Xiang Yuan,Chinese,1,"The ambience appears unassuming and ordinary, but Lu Xiang Yuan is an outstanding choice for tasty, affordable, regional Qingdao fare. The crowds have calmed, so tables are often available at peak meal times. This is the place to hit for deep bowlfuls of restorative Chinese noodle soups that could carry you through the day-picture translucent bean threads, long slices of dried tofu, and morsels of lamb bobbing among fragrant cilantro, Chinese wolfberries, and black tree mushrooms in a broth enhanced with smoky chili paste. Other intriguing dishes unveil delicate kingfish steaks that have been subtly smoked, gently spiced, and served chilled. The black bone chicken and ginseng soup showcases the dark flesh and deep flavor of its ingredients.",0,0
834,Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan,Chinese,1,"As New York's Sichuan renaissance continues apace, this pleasant and unpretentious Hunanese spot has popped up on Flushing's Main Street. The look here is tasteful and uncomplicated; the cooking is fiery and excellent. The extensive menu of Hunan specialties includes the likes of the classic regional dish, pork ""Mao's Style"" simmered in soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, oil, and stock, then braised to tender perfection. Boasting heat and meat in equal amounts, the spicy-sour string beans with pork expertly combines rich and savory aromatics, vinegary beans, and fragrant pork with tongue-numbing peppercorns. The barbecue fish Hunan-style is a brilliant menu standout. Smaller dishes, like winter melon with seafood soup, round out an expertly prepared meal.",0,0
835,Imperial Palace,Chinese,2,"You might mistake Imperial Palace for one of those red awning-covered restaurants on this strip of Chinese eateries-but don't. While it may share the same lettered signage, wide windows, and nondescript facade, inside find some of the best sticky rice and Dungeness crab Flushing has to offer. Seafood is front and center, with servers promptly presenting everything from deep-fried jumbo shrimp tossed with candied sesame walnuts to shrimp-stuffed tofu with slices of conch. It's easy to plow through all the fresh shellfish dishes with a chilled beer and sweet rice, but try to leave room for the clam casserole: a spicy broth full of Cantonese flavors, loads of onions, and small, briny clams, finished with a sprinkling of crisp coriander stems.",0,0
836,Mario's,Italian,2,"Does Staten Island really need another Italian-American restaurant? A fair question, but Chef/owner Mario Gentile confirms the answer is a yes. And, after a bite or two of his delicious red sauce food, you might be inclined to agree. Sprawled on a stretch of Richmond Road dotted with florists and bridal shops, Mario's offers big windows for people watching, leather banquettes, and oversized artwork. It's practically law in this borough to start your meal with calamari, and this respite doesn't disappoint-it's refreshingly light and served with a scrumptious, herby lemon sauce. Move on to a tender poached pear salad with crushed walnuts, creamy Gorgonzola, and crispy prosciutto; or fall-off-the-bone osso buco plated with a soft pile of saffron risotto.",0,0
837,Joe's Shanghai,Chinese,2,"Patience is a virtue at Joe's Shanghai, where a hectic rush to snag a table precedes a visit for the soup dumplings. As with most Flushing restaurants, flavor outdoes the interior decoration, with walls in need of fresh paint and dated furnishings. What the atmosphere lacks, the food fulfills as the kitchen swiftly prepares delicate xiao long bao, that despite stiff competition, still stand a head above the rest. The chefs have perfected the art of wrapping hot liquid into these soft, thin pouches, complete with spiraled shoulders. To bite into a soup dumpling is so sensual that diners don't even bother to glance at the flat-screens hanging in the dining room. While the menu offers fried bean curd and smoked fish, nothing sticks like the dumplings.",0,0
838,Hunan House,Chinese,1,"Located along quiet Northern Boulevard in Flushing, Hunan House offers a delicious reprieve from the street. The interior is crisp and sophisticated, with dark, ornately carved wood and thick linen tablecloths. But, the real draw here is the wonderfully authentic Hunanese fare, with its myriad fresh river fish; flavorful preserved meats; complex profiles; and mouth-puckering spice. Hunan House's menu is filled with exotic delights, but don't miss the wonderful starter of sautéed sour string beans featuring minced pork, chilies, ginger, and garlic; smoky dried bean curd with the same preserved meat; or spicy sliced fish-Hunan style, perfectly cooked and served in a delicious pool of fiery red sauce and plated with tender bulbs of bok choy.",0,0
839,O Lavrador,Portuguese,2,"This throwback pleases with rib-sticking Portuguese fare and an attention to hospitality. Choose between two experiences: the long, well-worn bar (which may be rowdy with soccer fans) or the spacious dining room, reached through lovely arches. Seasoned servers know how to charm and keep customers patient, as dishes are made to order and can take time. Zoom in on anything with bacalhau here, a superior air-dried fish (not salt-cured) with excellent flavor and texture. The bacalhau à pescador sates with a stew of clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, and potatoes. Another appealing soup is caldo verde full of meaty collards and smoky chorizo. Round out this elaborate feast with feijoada de mariscos, a slurry of white beans, seafood, and of course, more chorizo.",0,0
840,Fushimi,Fusion,3,"Fushimi is the ultimate spot for hungry locals in search of a dependable club scene sans commute. On any given night, its cozy booths are packed with islanders slinging back colorful cocktails and digging into architecturally designed sushi and sashimi from the Asian-fusion menu. Presentations are a knockout here, and the creativity and precision extends to the quality and combination of ingredients as well. Case in point: the aptly named Staten Island, a shrimp tempura roll topped with thin slices of seared filet mignon and dollops of mint-honey mustard and spicy aïoli. Sink your teeth into the long-braised short ribs, which are fall-off-the-bone tender and served with Korean galbi sauce and ""pee wee"" potato chips made from those adorably tiny tubers.",0,0
841,Hahm Ji Bach,Korean,2,"This beloved Queens institution enjoys fine digs where they serve popular and praise-worthy Korean food. The contemporary dining room is spacious and airy, with the warm, always informative, staff buzzing from table to table. It's not uncommon for the manager to roll up her own sleeves when the pace elevates-and elevate it does, for this is not your average Korean barbecue. It's hard to go wrong on Hahm Ji Bach's delightful menu, but don't miss the samgyeopsal, tender slabs of well-marinated pork belly sizzled to crispy perfection tableside for you to swaddle in crisp lettuce with paper-thin daikon radish, spicy kimchi, and bright scallions; or the mit bachan, a hot clay pot with soft steamed eggs, kimchi, tofu, pickled cucumbers, and spicy mackerel.",0,0
842,Spicy Lanka,Sri Lankan,1,"Walk through the door at Spicy Lanka, and-BAM!-the heady aroma of spice might just knock you off your feet. It's worth the trek to this far-out Jamaica restaurant, full of hip-hop music, brightly colored murals of palm trees, and an unbridled enthusiasm for heat and colliding Sri Lankan flavors. The biryani is steamed for hours in a bubbling blend of cardamom, nutmeg, paprika, bay leaves, and star anise, then tossed with garlic- and ginger-marinated chicken and okra-a blast of flavor on the palate. Further rock your world with the string hopper kothu, mutton curry filled with noodles and a fistful of herbs and spices-think cardamom, cloves, and turmeric. To cool off, treat your tongue to the watalappam coconut custard, spiked with bits of buttery cashew.",0,0
843,Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong,Korean,2,"The Korean barbecue of the moment is a short LIRR trip away, and well worth the ride. This was the first East Coast branch of (Korean wrestler and TV personality) Kang Ho Dong's growing empire-and it is already among the best in the city. A younger sib now resides in midtown. The menu is focused, the space is enormous, the air is clean, and the service is friendly. Start your grill off with steamed egg, corn, cheese, and more to cook along the sides while marbled pork belly or deeply flavorful marinated skirt steak strips sizzle at the center. Bibimbap is a classic rendition, mixing beef seasoned with gochujang, vegetables, sesame, nori, and crisp sprouts in a hot stone bowl-so hot that it sears the bottom rice to golden while cooking the raw egg on top.",0,0
844,New Leaf Café,American,2,"Located in a 1930s mansion designed by the Olmstead brothers, New Leaf Café was opened as part of the New York Restoration Project. The inside feels like a large cottage with stone walls and arched windows. Alfresco lunch on the flagstone terrace showcases this high, hilly setting with unparalleled views of the Palisades (squint to find the George Washington Bridge). The American menu features a fried risotto cake with gooey mozzarella over Tokyo turnips and sweet pea coulis; or a hunk of seared tuna with tiny mushroom-filled ravioli. Profiteroles are a particular treat, filled with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with luscious chocolate sauce. The gorgeous surrounds and jazz concerts make this a sought-after spot for private events after sun down.",0,0
845,El Nuevo Bohío,Puerto Rican,1,"On a prominent corner, windows filled with lechòn lure in passersby with mouthwatering visions of shiny-skinned roast pork. Beloved by the local Puerto Rican community, the front room is minimally adorned and often filled with lines of those waiting for to-go orders. Snag a seat in the back-where bright walls are flooded with photos-for friendly table service. Begin with morcilla, a thick blood sausage bright with chili peppers, cilantro, and garlic before moving on to the succulent pernil, pork shoulder roasted to a luxuriously crisp exterior and served with stinging garlic sauce, rice and beans, and plantains. Don't miss an array of complex sopas-from rich cow's feet soup with yucca and sweet potato to asopado de carmarones, a hearty combo of rice and shrimp.",0,0
846,Joe's Place,Puerto Rican,2,"From abuelas to niños, locals know to come to this ""place"" for solid Puerto Rican food. A glance at the wall of politicos and celebrities who have dined here proves how well-loved it truly is. The space is divided into two very different areas: a classic lunch counter also serving takeout, and a dark wood dining room. A wonderful Nuyerican accent can be heard at gathering family tables and tasted in classic dishes like mofongo al pilon de bistec (savory shredded beef over mashed plantains) or pernil con arroz y gandules (roasted pork with pigeon peas and rice). Prices become even more reasonable when you realize that dishes are big enough to be split three ways. Daily sopa specials are a highlight, but end meals with hot and flaky cheese-filled pastelito.",0,0
847,Sik Gaek,Korean,2,"There may be glitzier Korean spots in town, but insanely delicious, exceedingly simple Sik Gaek assures a good time, every time. Dressed in silly costumes, the staff is always having a blast in this seasonally decorated shack-like dining room featuring corrugated metal roofs, street lights, buckets for shells, and walls papered in dollar bills. Booths along the edge are filled with noisy regulars. The kitchen serves the ocean's bounty, starting with a deliciously crisp and gargantuan pancake, pajeon, studded with seafood and kimchi begging to be dipped in enticingly salty soy-sesame sauce. A cloudy soup bobbing with tofu arrives piping hot, boasting that sharp, nutty, telltale flavor of fermented bean curd, and seems to have its own restorative powers.",0,0
848,Tong Sam Gyup Goo Yi,Korean,2,"Murray Hill is no stranger to Korean food, but this prized, pig-loving barbecue destination is always packed. Inside, the bright room's décor forgoes all frills to focus on regional specialties. Smiling servers are earnest and hospitable. Begin with the usual but very exquisite banchan like pickled turnips, fermented bean paste soup, and specially aged house kimchi-funky, garlicky, and a total pleasure. Bowls of glassy naengmyun noodles dancing in a chilled broth with kimchi are just as popular. Yet what makes this place unique is that barbecue grill on each table, used for sizzling slices of flavorful duck with miso, garlic cloves, and bean sprouts; spicy, tender bits of octopus; and sweet, fatty pork with soy sauce, red chili paste, and scallions.",0,0
849,Estrellita Poblana III,Mexican,1,"The Arthur Avenue area may be known as the artery of the Little Italy of the Bronx, but a Mexican restaurant shines here with its fluffy tamales loaded with tender, fragrant corn, and much more. The small interior is brightened with gold walls, a fuchsia ceiling, and three stars set in the fuchsia coffered ceiling. Exposed brick and a semi-open kitchen complete the comfortable scene. Conversation is common between the pleasant servers and other diners, as searing hot sopa with shredded chicken and a nest of fideos, is placed on an immaculate table. The bistec Estrellita is served with a fiery habanero sauce, topped with pico de gallo, and flanked by a side of rice and beans. Flan is a lovely finish-though that generous steak may fulfill even the heartiest appetite.",0,0
850,Roberto's,Italian,2,"You can't miss Roberto's, whose distinctive design falls somewhere between a cozy, welcoming farmhouse and a Mediterranean villa complete with a coral-hued façade and wrought-iron balcony. One of the most highly regarded restaurants in the borough, this storied Italian-American is the kind of charmer that makes groups feel right at home. It's also the kind of place that piles on the pasta and takes espresso seriously, whether it's the fettuccine special that features fresh shaved truffle, the soft-shell crabs finished in a butter-white wine sauce, or the ricotta cream that fills an insanely good cannoli. For a real taste of what makes Roberto's shine, let the hearty tubettini con polipo e fave, folded with grilled octopus, fava beans, and baby clams speak for itself.",0,0
851,Enzo's of Arthur Ave,Italian,2,"It's easy to love Enzo's, a quaint red-sauce throwback on Arthur Avenue. In an area once dominated by Italian-American culture, including a library full of Italian literature, Enzo's sits among longstanding favorites and clearly is welcomed as part of the family. The popular bar invites local business owners and faculty from nearby Fordham University for casual conversation, while the kitchen churns out steaming plates of glistening clams oreganata and rich pastas delivered by a careful service team. The nostalgic Sunday special-pillow-soft gnocchi topped with tomato gravy and slow-braised pork braciola tucked with garlic, parsley, and cheese-is worth an end-of-weekend quest. So is the fresh swordfish steak with wonderfully assertive Livornese sauce.",0,0
852,Brisas del Caribe,Latin American,1,"Thanks to a major exterior facelift, Brisas del Caribe is looking finer than ever. The interior is still adorned with frescos of Caribbean beach scenes and benches to ease the wait for tables, but everyone's eyes are drawn to the piles of food, sopas, and counters laden with freshly made cakes sold by the slice. No matter the time of day, this place is packed with large families and groups of locals enjoying copious amounts of hot, tasty, ridiculously affordable comfort food. Start with a hearty Dominican treat like sancocho, or go for relleno de papa, deep-fried mashed potatoes stuffed with gooey cheese and aromatic ground meat. Don't miss the superb patitas de cerdo, a stew of pig's feet with cassava, potatoes, herbs, and strips of tripe.",0,0
853,zero otto nove,Italian,2,"This Arthur Avenue favorite is easily recognized by the powder-blue FIAT parked outside, but is better appreciated for the wood-burning dome oven. Brick and cement archways, high ceilings, and a second-floor dining terrace strive to keep that oven-and its wares-within each table's line of vision. The menu showcases Salerno-style cooking with pizzas, baked pastas, and wood-fired entrées. In fact any dish that is ""al cartoccio"" (in parchment) is sure to please. Open up this pouch to try the pitch-perfect al dente radiatori baked with porcini, cherry tomatoes, breadcrumbs, and loads of deliciously spicy sausage. The ragù Salernitano is a gut-busting triumph of stewed braciole, sausage, and tender meatballs. The Nutella calzone makes a sweet, rich finish.",0,0
854,Tra Di Noi,Italian,2,"Decked out with crimson walls and red checkered tablecloths, this is the kind of place where diners feel like they're in on a delicious secret-and that's no coincidence, as Tra Di Noi is Italian for ""between us."" Responsible for the success behind this tiny spot is Chef/owner Marco Coletta, who directs the front and back of house with the precision of an air traffic controller and the passion of an Italian nonno. This sincerity shines through in the cooking, from the ethereally light gnocchi di patate in a rich lamb ragù to the quickly pan-fried fillet of sole francese nestled in a creamy lemon sauce with shrimp, parsley, and white wine. Only a few desserts are on offer, and all are made in house. For a classic finale, go with the ricotta cheesecake.",0,0
855,Neerob,Asian,1,"Short on atmosphere but saturated in fiery flavor, this Bronx restaurant dishes out some of the best Bangladeshi fare this side of South Asia. Though harsh lighting, steam tables, and a cash register give the main room the feel of a fast food joint, none of that will matter after that first bite of sultry, explosively spicy cuisine. Shingara, vegetable pakoras, and samosas are always available. This is in addition to a parade of daily specials: chandal, yellow lentils, is seasoned with garlic, ginger, and cumin; jumbo prawns or golda chingri are simmered in a thick sauce of spiced coconut milk; and gura mas, pan-fried small fish, swim in a tangy purée of greens and mustard oil. Order plenty of buttery, multi-layered paratha to scoop up the curries.",0,0
856,Taqueria Tlaxcalli,Mexican,1,"What this sweet little Mexican spot lacks in looks it makes up for in personality-plus a warm, inviting atmosphere that draws a constant stream of locals. Behind the counter, a smiling staff prepares each order with machine gun speed, and professional servers are quick to help anyone not fluent in Spanish. Daily specials could include anything from a complex mole to slow-braised goat with broth, though the menu is rife with options. Begin with a torta, stuffed with steak, layers of beans, avocado, onions, lettuce, and a bright chipotle mayo. In the molcajetes, grilled cactus strips, Mexican sausage, and tortillas are sautéed and then buried under a spicy green sauce and sprinkled with queso. A nice end is found in a cool disk of coconut flan.",0,0
857,900 Park,Italian,2,"Neither fancy nor innovative, there is a certain heartwarming quality that makes this an easy place to return to time and again. Couples often settle in the lounge near the fireplace while larger groups gather in the elevated dining room for platters of hot antipasti. White leather chairs, cotton panels, and rustic tables lend a breezy feel. Italian and Italian-American classics span the wide menu, from grilled calamari with a mild tomato sauce topped with peppers and black olives, to ridged tubes of manicotti stuffed with ricotta and pecorino, cooked in a meaty Bolognese and finished with a rich béchamel. Brick-oven pizzas are always worthy orders, especially the Calabrese decked with spicy soppressata and a few dollops of mozzarella.",0,0
858,Mythos,Greek,2,"A gathering place for Greeks and non-Greeks alike, this family-run and friendly restaurant tempts with impeccably fresh fish, cooked over charcoal and basted simply with olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs. Beyond the whitewashed exterior and dark blue awning is a large dining room with rows of neat tables for indulging in Hellenic pleasures, from zesty appetizers to boisterous conversations. Settle into an array of pikilia; cold appetizers such as melitzansalata, eggplant whipped with herbs and olive oil. Chargrilled fish, priced by the pound, has a delightfully smoky essence and moist flesh. Whole smelts are a rare and traditional treat, simply pan-fried with a lemony herb dressing. Finish with a choice of authentic, nutty, and syrup-soaked pastries.",0,0
859,Tang,Korean,2,"When craving authentic Korean specialties, Tang is an absolute must-visit. The restaurant's impeccably cool style extends from its angled exterior ablaze in beams of yellow light to its sleek interior with exposed brick walls and bare wood tables. The attractive art gallery next door is attached and doubles as a private dining space. Meals begin with an unending supply of wonderfully crisp and mild house kimchi. Also try the hearty bibimbap of marinated beef strips, root vegetables, and mushrooms alongside a bowl of ox-bone broth. The main attraction is the sensational jeon, traditional Korean pancakes grilled to order (weekend dinners, only). Round out the meal with steamed pigs feet accompanied by Tang's special fiery, salty, shrimp-based dipping sauce.",0,0
860,Patricia's,Italian,2,"Much more than a neighborhood staple, Patricia's is an elegant restaurant committed to the convivial spirit of Southern Italy. Its seasonal fare is served in a gracious, brick-lined dining room among white tablecloths, chandeliers, and the warmth of a wood-burning oven. That brick oven churns out pleasing pizzas with lightly charred crusts, like the Regina simply adorned in buffalo mozzarella, torn basil, and a drizzle of excellent olive oil. Spaghetti Frank Sinatra is a stain-making bowl of slippery pasta loaded with shrimp, clams, olives, and capers in chunky tomato sauce. A light touch is seen in the grilled vegetables, topped with paper-thin cremini mushrooms. Don't miss the flaky and gently poached baccalà alla Livornese in a sharp, tangy sauce.",0,0
861,Viceroy of India,Indian,1,"The periwinkle and lavender walls, sky-blue ceiling painted with clouds, and steely booths lining the spacious dining room at Viceroy of India keep things cool, letting the spice-inflected cuisine churned out by the kitchen provide the heat. White linen-draped tables as well as a full bar and wine list make this West Rogers Park retreat a regal choice. Though an à la carte menu is available for those who've got to get their fill of tandoori chicken, longtime patrons and lunch regulars make a beeline for the popular lunch buffet, stocked with North Indian standards like pakoras, samosas, saag paneer, chicken makhani, and goat curry. Complimentary naan is available by the basketful. The grab-and-go café next door lets passersby get their sweet fix.",0,0
862,Cochon Volant,French,2,"Though it's attached to the Hyatt, Cochon Volant is quickly entrenching itself as a favorite with Loop locals and sightseers alike for its timeless warmth. Round bistro tables and bentwood chairs are clustered across the mosaic-tiled floor, while a broad, marble-topped bar is bustling with patrons from lunch to happy hour. French brasserie favorites dominate the menu, ranging from rustic French onion soup to lavish raw seafood plateaus. Steak frites are juicy and flavorsome with a tender prime cut of bavette, offered with five sauce options like a classic béarnaise or rich Roquefort. Breakfast is delicious, but for those who don't have time to sit and stay a while, the café and takeaway bakery lets commuters snag a pastry and coffee to go.",0,0
863,Rosebud Prime,Steakhouse,3,"A member of Chicago's longstanding Rosebud Restaurants, this Loop darling plays the part of a throwback American steakhouse to the hilt. Crimson-hued, faux-alligator chairs and banquettes punctuate a sprawling wood-paneled dining room, where tuxedoed servers weave expertly among suited bankers. A winding staircase leads to a lofty mezzanine. Classic cuts and chops abound, but Rosebud Prime does all of its dishes with panache. Double-cut bone-in lamb chops sport a plump ribbon of fat encircling their delicate, rich centers. Two strips of grilled skirt steak remain juicy and tender, complemented by a pile of caramelized Bermuda onions; and rich beef and veal ragù makes penne Bolognese a lovely surprise, finished with a dollop of fresh ricotta.",0,0
864,Atwood,Contemporary,2,"This corner restaurant's 19th century façade may be historic, but its soaring dining room is a strikingly modern vision of white marble-topped tables, glossy beveled subway tiles, and low-slung black leather chairs and banquettes. The crimson bar stools fill with patrons meeting for business and pleasure all week, while brunch gets the place buzzing on weekends. Atwood's brasserie menu isn't exactly full of surprises, but its familiar foods are given first-class upgrades-think pancetta-studded mac and cheese; lamb chops with basil and preserved lemon; and an omelet with crunchy bacon, creamy Brie, and verdant asparagus. For a real wake-up call, the Inferno Virgin Mary has more than enough of a kick (plus more of that bacon as a garnish).",0,0
865,Prime & Provisions,Steakhouse,3,"Though it would also feel at home in Las Vegas, this glitzy oversized steakhouse fits right in with its swanky Chicago riverfront neighbors. The polished, masculine interior makes its priorities clear from the get-go, showcasing a two-story wine tower and a peek into the dry-aging room under bold barrel-vaulted ceilings and chandeliers. A starter of chewy rosemary-sea salt monkey bread whets the palate, while rosy pink slices of slow-roasted bone-in prime rib, rubbed with a crust of fragrant herbs, take a classic hoagie to new heights. When paired with house-cut fries and creamy horseradish dip, it's a meal to rival a Porterhouse, but save room for dessert: a single-serving banana cream pie with loads of whipped cream is a whimsical final bite.",0,0
866,The Kitchen,American,2,"Panoramic views and eye-popping spaces are par for the course at most of the lofty spots abutting the Chicago River, but The Kitchen's farm-to-table food manages to steer the focus back to the plate. The restaurant's approachable, community-minded take on straightforward seasonal food-along with its impressive drinks program-makes it easy to please. Even if you're not attending a Monday ""Community Night"" dinner alongside many of the purveyors whose ingredients appear on the plate, you'll find a fresh, flavorful mix of dishes. Crushed white bean bruschetta is topped with a sprightly herb and frisée salad, which is in turn dressed with a blood orange vinaigrette. And wild Bristol Bay salmon is poached with care, its silkiness punctuated by garlic-chive aïoli.",0,0
867,Chicago Cut,Steakhouse,3,"Chicago Cut is a steakhouse perfectly suited for the City of the Big Shoulders. The finely tailored locale bustles day and night, thanks to being wrapped in windows along the riverfront, sumptuous red leather furnishings, warm wood trim, and a crackerjack service team cementing its steakhouse vibe. Non-meat entrées include cedar-planked salmon with a sriracha-honey glaze, but make no mistake: beef is boss here. Prime steaks, butchered and dry-aged in-house for 35 days, get just the right amount of time under the flame, as is the case with the perfectly cooked-to-order Porterhouse-pre-sliced and plated for each guest. Sides are a must and should include the dome of hashbrowns, creamed spinach redolent of nutmeg, or tender stalks of grilled asparagus.",0,0
868,Remington's,American,2,"This shiny gem arrives courtesy of the 4 Star Restaurant Group behind Crosby's Kitchen, Dunlay's, and Frasca. Guests can choose from a few great seating options in the enormous space: a table by the large windows up front, thrown open on temperate days for people-watching; the U-shaped bar, chockablock with televisions airing the latest games; or the intimate, glassed-in dining room lined with wine bottles at the back. The restaurant features an elevated roster of American classics including steaks, rotisserie chicken and seafood-not to mention a raw bar with Kansai-style box-pressed sushi. It's hard to go wrong here, but don't miss the No. 8 Tuna, which is a ruby-red slice of ahi wrapped in crispy nori and tempura, then paired with kimchi-studded rice.",0,0
869,Untitled Supper Club,Contemporary,2,"An unmarked entrance leads the way to this sultry subterranean lair, its various rooms pumping out music and serving up handcrafted cocktails to a young, sexy clientele lounging in tufted leather banquettes. Lights are nice and sultry; tables are low-slung and casual; and there are no less than 507 whiskeys to choose from. A charcuterie board may offer up silky duck rillettes, shot through with foie gras; textured and spreadable liverwurst; as well as thin slices of prosciutto and coppa accompanied by a house-made mostarda. Overstuffed squash blossom rellenos are filled with creamy ricotta and served over Agave-spiked corn relish and chili-lime crema. Don't miss the scrumptious meatloaf sandwich, slathered with Korean-style ketchup, and laced with rosemary-infused aïoli.",0,0
870,The Gage,Gastropub,2,"For 10 years, this expansive, eclectic gastropub has catered to the Millennium Park crowds. Handsome banquettes and columns wrapped in celadon tiles lend a clubby allure, but the space's buzzy vibe never feels overwhelming. While a bar stretching half the length of the restaurant gets its fair share of happy-hour crowds, the rear dining rooms offer a more relaxed setting. Pub classics with flair define the menu, like malt-battered cod with creamy tartar sauce and parsley-dusted thick-cut fries-a solid rendition of fish and chips. Keep it light with crunchy watercress and sugar snap pea salad with house-made burrata, or go all out with a plate of chocolate-toffee cream puffs garnished with tender cocoa-dusted marshmallows.",0,0
871,RPM Steak,Steakhouse,4,"RPM Steak shares the same sleek, moneyed vibe as still-happening RPM Italian, its sister restaurant located just around the corner. Polished black, white, and wood décor speaks to the finer things in life, with a menu of succulent steaks, raw bar offerings, and sides to back it up. For the best people-watching, score one of the semicircular booths edging the room. A massive single tiger prawn, served simply on ice with lemon, is a tasty, visually stunning starter. Steaks range from petite filets to dry-aged 24-ounce cowboy cuts with a list of big reds to match. Highlights include the classic, deeply satisfying steak frites, tender and pink inside, charred outside, and complemented by truffle béarnaise for the meat and Caesar dip for the fries.",0,0
872,Acanto,Italian,2,"Overseen by Billy Lawless, this Italian reincarnation set in the former Henri space knows how to make an impression: its prime location across from Millennium Park would be a looker any day, but it goes the extra mile with style and sociability. The dining room is striking with angular light fixtures and orange banquettes; a luminous marble bar and matching tables lend a masculine, sophisticated vibe. The carte's Italian standards are amped up to luxurious levels, like the Treviso and white bean salad with fennel, golden raisins, and crispy pancetta; or house-made duck egg spaghetti drenched in cream sauce and twirled around rapini, spicy pork sausage, and caramelized onions. For dessert, a fresh ricotta tart is highlighted by bittersweet orange marmalade.",0,0
873,Siena Tavern,Italian,2,"Chef Fabio Viviani's TV-ready Italian charisma extends to every corner of this huge, lively restaurant. A mixture of funky décor elements-like cascading plants ""growing"" from filing cabinets on walls-somehow manage to work in incongruous harmony with sexy black marble and stainless steel throughout the multilevel space. Various bars offer pizza, crudo, fresh mozzarella, and house-made pasta, though even globally influenced dishes have a Mediterranean touch. The Tavern burger accompanied by parmesan-dusted fries is stacked with melted Taleggio, crispy speck, and garlic aïoli. Order the lush, creamy tiramisù for dessert, which gets a crunch from chopped nuts and crisp homemade meringues, and you'll be tempted to lick the bottom of the zinc tin.",0,0
874,Bavette's Bar & Boeuf,American,3,"Restaurateur Brendan Sokoloff (also of Maude's Liquor Bar and Au Cheval) breathes new life into the tried-and-true steakhouse concept with this swanky destination. The vibe inside may be dark and loud, but that only adds to the bonhomie of the chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures, and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas. Predictably, steakhouse and raw bar standards dominate the menu. Most steaks are wet-aged, and though some may prefer more funk, the cuts are expertly broiled. The kitchen deserves praise for unexpected options like creamy short rib stroganoff featuring hand-cut pasta; buttermilk fried chicken; and sides such as elote-style corn in a rich cheese sauce sparked with lime.",0,0
875,Tortoise Club,American,3,"Every city needs a restaurant with the word ""club"" in the title-somewhere reassuringly old-school where you'd take your future father-in-law if you want to marry his daughter. Tortoise Club fits the bill perfectly. If it was just a few years older, it would be called an institution because it also harks back to more dissolute times; order a Negroni at lunchtime here and no one will bat an eyelid. The place has an unapologetically masculine look thanks to the mahogany paneling and dark leather seating. It has a lounge bar with nightly live jazz and a familiar menu of American classics, from big plates of seafood to great steaks. Where it differs from many similar spots is that here the service is sprightly and sincere and the welcome is warm.",0,0
876,Gilt Bar,Gastropub,2,"In the shadow of Merchandise Mart, it's not easy to miss the revolving door entrance to Gilt Bar, a moody and imposing River North favorite. The bar up front mixes cocktails to a metronomic rhythm, while the back is more intimate with brick walls, studded leather banquettes, and nostalgic lighting. However make no mistake: this is no Bugsy Malone speakeasy, but a grown-up version for bar-flies with astute palates. Snack on creamy burrata and shaved ham finished with a swig of extra virgin olive oil before savoring tender, flavorful pork meatballs on a bed of wilted kale with romesco and almond gremolata. In the end, gorge on an unctuous brown butter-apple cake with salted caramel and vanilla ice cream-perhaps to the dulcet tunes of Bob Dylan. Bliss.",0,0
877,Travelle,Mediterranean,3,"This contemporary Mediterranean dining room shares its home-a landmark Mies van der Rohe tower completed in 1972-with The Langham hotel. Floor-to-ceiling windows on the second floor space offer views of Marina City, but with its stunning kitchen displayed behind gradient glass panels, the scene inside is equally dramatic. Creative add-ins bring flair and flavor to flawlessly executed and gorgeously composed dishes. A perfect, toothsome champagne risotto is enlivened by juicy, barely pickled grapes and toasted Marcona almonds, while a thick, creamy tranche of seared salmon rests on ""healthy"" fried green farro, finished with a tangy drizzle of spicy soy-mustard. Raspberry coulis and meringue shards are an ideal garnish for a fresh and zesty citrus tart.",0,0
878,C Chicago,Seafood,3,"This spacious looker lands in River North courtesy of the team behind the popular Chicago Cut Steakhouse. At C Chicago, the focus is on fresh-make that really fresh-seafood. This is exciting news: there aren't many seafood restaurants in Chicago, and the few that exist aren't doing it like the talented Chef Bill Montagne, who hails from the piscine temple, Le Bernardin. Kick things off with a beautiful scallop carpaccio kissed with olive oil, lemon juice, basil, chives and Espelette pepper. Then nibble on an irresistibly chewy farro salad, served warm, tossed with charred corn, mustard greens, and topped with whipped feta. The baked Aleutian cod, arriving in a perfectly subtle Basquaise sauce and dotted with squid ink and red wine vinaigrette is sublime.",0,0
879,Celeste,Contemporary,3,"Celeste celebrates the city's close relationship with that great American institution-the bar. It is a veritable fun palace evoking the great drinking establishments of the last century and is spread over three floors. On the first floor is a bar with an abbreviated menu. On the second floor is the narrow and nominally named Deco Room where the marble-topped tables face another bar; and upstairs is reserved for private parties. The food is certainly more than a mere addendum to the terrific cocktail list and the kitchen is clearly a skilled one. Dishes are quite elaborate in their construction-order lamb and you may find it includes the loin, belly and sweetbreads- and they are as flavorsome as they are attractive.",0,0
880,Slurping Turtle,Japanese,2,"Both turtles and noodles symbolize longevity, so a meal at Slurping Turtle should add a few years to your life (and warmth to your belly). Inside the minimalist bento box of a space, diners sit elbow-to-elbow at sleek white communal tables. Boutique Japanese beverages like Hitachino Nest beer and Ramuné bubble-gum soda bring smiles to patrons in the know. Along with deep, steaming bowls of ramen and udon, the lengthy menu serves small plates, sushi, and other Japanese comfort food for snacking and sharing. Tender ribeye and chicken skewers arrive moist and glistening, straight from the binchotan charcoal grill. Deep-fried Brussels sprouts are crispy outside and tender inside without a hint of grease, topped with sliced scallions and fried shallots.",0,0
881,Paris Club,French,2,"Some of Paris Club was commandeered to create a ramen spot next door, but in return for this munificence, it got a first-rate makeover. Dressed in red leather seats, wood panelling and globe lighting, it perfectly captures the look of a traditional Parisian brasserie. The only thing missing is insouciant service and someone with a dog on their lap. The menu is unapologetically Gallic, ""Le Prime Steakburger"" notwithstanding, and all the classics are present: from fruits de mer to steak frites and baba au rhum. The pommes purée is so wonderfully buttery you'll need a defibrillator on standby. The wine list is all French too. On the second floor find Studio Paris, a proper nightclub with bottle service and celebrity DJ appearances.",0,0
882,Ramen-san,Asian,1,"Lettuce Entertain You brings you bowlfuls of ingredient-driven noodle soups served up right next door to the restaurant group's Paris Club. The menu at this Asian concept revolves around a handful of tastefully crafted broths dancing with thin, wavy noodles produced by Sun Noodle. The tonkotsu ramen is a traditional pleasure afloat with sweet slices of chashu, wakame, and molten egg. Meanwhile, the smoked brisket ramen is a novel departure defined by a black garlic-enriched chicken broth and slices of Bub City's 18-hour brisket. Ramen-san's loyal following is comprised of hipsters and suits alike, and they all seem to dig the salvaged look and booming playlist. Night owls take note: Japanese whiskies rule the bar and fried rice is served late into the night.",0,0
883,Sixteen,Contemporary,4,"This bold setting puts the Chicago River, Tribune and Wrigley buildings at your fingertips from the sixteenth floor of the Trump Hotel. The lobby entrance is as unremarkable as the dining room is dramatic, centered around an enormous Swarovski chandelier that hangs like an inverted wedding cake over a curving wall of African rosewood. Beyond this lies a kitchen that takes itself very seriously, but that's ok. Chef Thomas Lents' cuisine is extraordinary, accomplished, and even more of a draw than the décor. Meals here are very conceptual and include head-spinning affairs that articulate a theme, like the ""Faces of Sixteen"" as an homage to inspirations and employees. This may translate as a tribute to Joël Robuchon through a pot of wonderfully smooth, raw and seasoned langoustine artfully topped with gelée and sea buckthorn. Another theme ""Food in Progress, Modern Fine Dining: Moving Forward with Respect to the Past"" ponders the emergence of the Nordic through a gently smoked oyster, flavorful potato gelée, horseradish, and caraway. Grilled lobster with uni, coffee, and rice is downright unforgettable. Desserts like lemon tart with diplomat cream and fennel are as innovative as they are delicious.",2,1
884,Hubbard Inn,Mediterranean,2,"Handsome from head-to-toe, the Hubbard Inn takes the idea of a classic tavern and dresses it to the nines. Brass-clad globe lights glow above lacquered plank tables in the front bar room, leading to tufted leather couches and fireplaces in the book-lined and Hogwarts-worthy library. The second floor is low-slung and loungy. A wall-sized chalkboard behind the marble bar whets whistles with descriptions of house cocktails. Shareable farm-to-table dishes appeal to nearly every appetite. Kale salad, that ubiquitous menu staple, gets a new twist when tossed with pickled blackberries, candied walnuts, and grated ricotta salata. And, a quartet of juicy, beautifully cooked lamb chops over rustic chickpea purée is brightened by a handful of chopped olives and mint.",0,0
885,Bub City,Barbecue,2,"Bub City isn't as far south as Nashville or Memphis, but the country music vibe comes through just the same at this barbecue- and booze-focused hang. Two bars flank the main stage that hosts nightly live entertainment. One bar is a shrine to over 100 varieties of whiskey, and the other to beer-easily identified by the American flag made from empty cans stacked behind its counter. Along with the extensive lineup of traditional smoked brisket, ribs, and fried chicken, a raw bar brings chilled seafood refreshment before spicy cheese-stuffed Texas Torpedoes and loaded hot link sandwiches. A bowl of Smokie's chili arrives with a kick from sliced jalapeño, but the caddy of barbecue and hot sauces on each table lets heat fiends intensify the seasoning.",0,0
886,Everest,French,4,"Summit the historic Chicago Stock Exchange building via a private elevator to reach the sophisticated-though not outdated-scene at Everest on the 40th floor. The sunken-level dining room stays dimly lit by contemporary circular metal light fixtures, all the better to gaze admiringly at the views from the windows framing the formal space. Heavy white linens and abstract bronze sculptures adorn each table, at which smartly-dressed guests take it all in. Alsatian chef Jean Joho keeps to the French tradition on his degustation and prix-fixe menus, with nods to local ingredients among the classical techniques and pairings presented nightly. Where other chefs may feel the need to update and tweak time-honored dishes, Everest celebrates its classics. Subtle hints of ginger in a rich Gewürztraminer butter sauce complement succulent chunks of fresh Maine lobster. Two thick, bone-in lamb chops, ringed elegantly with flavorful fat, are tender but never too chewy, their richness amplified by delicate, silken spring garlic flan and a bed of crisp green beans that soak up the thyme jus. Cap it all off with tart and sweet pistachio vanilla succès dabbed with ruddy rhubarb jam.",1,1
887,Bottlefork,Contemporary,2,"Bottlefork, Forkbottle-yup, we get it, it's a ""bar & kitchen"" but, in this case, a very good one. The narrow room is dominated by a 40-foot bar which morphs into an open kitchen. The lights are turned down and the music is turned up-and unless they know Big Audio Dynamite, it's not music for kids. When it comes to the food, ""locally sourced and globally inspired"" is their USP with the chef, a Four Seasons alumnus, making much of his largely European peregrinations. Expect punchy flavors, teasing combinations, clever twists, and everything from salumi and tuna crudo in a jar to ""popcorn"" sweetbreads, pastas, and Moroccan stews. The terrific cocktail and drinks list covers all bases too. And who isn't tempted to take dessert in liquid form?",0,0
888,Topolobampo,Mexican,4,"This jewel in Bayless' culinary crown welcomes a rush of serious eaters and canoodlers for original south-of-the-border fare-with an upscale twist. While it may share an entrance and bar with sibling, Frontera Grill, that is where the likeness ends. Walk past a sliding door to enter this elegant, terra cotta-lined dining room, which feels worlds away from the fiesta upfront. Lunch is notably laid-back, but chatty, over-eager servers turn dinner into a more exhaustive experience. Enduring their descriptive chalk talk may feel a bit like sitting through a college lecture for some, but be patient as you will be rewarded with exceptional food boasting a panoply of flavors, colors, and textures. A trio of ceviches highlighting albacore, tomato, and olive; Yucatecan shrimp and calamari; and tuna coctel make for divine starters. And, the sopa seca de fideos, tossed in a saucy tomato-morita broth and fortified by chorizo, crema, and Brussels sprouts, is perhaps the best in the country. Desserts are flagrantly inventive and the strongest element of this epicurean show. A torta de elote or warm corn cake with golden corn ice cream, cherry preserves, and salty caramel corn is absolutey fantastic.",1,1
889,Coco Pazzo,Italian,2,"Vibrant blue-and-orange awnings help Coco Pazzo make its mark among the area's stellar restaurants, though their reputation for seasonal Tuscan cuisine has been going strong since 1992. Navy velvet curtains that hang in the wide, welcoming, high-ceilinged room may dampen the din, but not the enthusiasm from regulars ready for a delicious mid-day tavolata and bottle from the all-Italian wine list. Business types fill every seat for the piatti unici, a chef-chosen lunch special that changes daily but is always made with expert care. Selections may include Rushing Rivers trout over lentils and spinach paired with speck- and mushroom-studded risotto made with Carnaroli rice. Dinner options like pancetta-wrapped quail with taleggio fondue showcase the kitchen's ambitious side.",0,0
890,Frontera Grill,Mexican,2,"The linchpin in Rick Bayless' empire, Frontera Grill is decidedly unique in its homage to regional Mexican cuisine and displays a near cult-like devotion to local product. The service at this dining room, psychedelic in its color scheme, can verge on vapid, but find a seat on the bar side for a warmer (and worthier) experience. The ever-changing menu is cohesive with a mix of classics and specialties like sopa azteca, a nourishing pasilla chile broth poured atop crisp tortilla strips, cool avocado, grilled chicken, and jack cheese. A version of the classic from Morelia, enchiladas a la plaza are first flash-fried, then folded over seasoned cabbage, potatoes, and carrots. Pair this plate with a side of spinach in green chile and you won't be unhappy. Ever.",0,0
891,Embeya,Fusion,2,"Floor-to-ceiling windows put Embeya's industrial interior on display, letting passersby soak up its intriguing sculptural elements and Asian-inspired decor. Inside, blown-glass bouquets of light fixtures hang above communal tables, and wooden screens in intricate cutout patterns divide the lofty, airy dining room and open kitchen, where Chef Mike Sheerin and his team whip up enticing Pan-Asian fare. The affordable lunch menu features dishes like carrot salad with shaved country ham, an assertively spicy togarashi dressing, and a swipe of yuzu curd; or udon in a thickened broth with diced tofu and seasonal vegetables. Dinner entrées display more ambition, as in poached halibut with coconut, hearts of palm, and mint fumet.",0,0
892,Sepia,American,3,"When a restaurant's excellence is this consistent, it should come as no surprise that the First Lady names it as one of her favorites. Set inside a 19th century print shop, the historic dining room does a fine job mixing original details with modern touches. Muted tones in the exposed brick walls and custom tile flooring complement newer elements like floor-to-ceiling wine storage and dramatic smoke-shaded chandeliers that drip with crystals. Though the décor may tip its hat to yesteryear, Chef Andrew Zimmerman's cuisine is firmly grounded in the 21st century. Whether you visit for lunch or dinner, meals here always seem to reflect the amalgam of American cuisine, with hints of Southeast Asian, Korean, and Mediterranean tastes. Potato gnocchi may seem commonplace, but this version is memorable thanks to the flawless components and rich, profound flavors of lamb sugo with crunchy bits of ciabatta breadcrumbs. Chicken here is downright exciting, served tender and crisp-skinned with a supremely buttery Albufera sauce, crumbly chestnuts, caramelized fennel, and sausage. Simple-sounding desserts keep the bar high, with offerings like toffee-coconut cake with chocolate ganache and burnt caramel.",1,1
893,Roka Akor,Asian,3,"There's no shortage of flash at Roka Akor, the local offshoot of a London-based-via-Scottsdale Japanese steakhouse and sushi temple. The massive LED-illuminated glass hood of the showstopping robata station grabs attention in the center of the vast space, with a brigade of black-clad line cooks working the flames. For a front row seat of the action, sit at the surrounding counter topped with charred shou-sugi-ban wood. With such a prominent display, guests would be remiss not to try choices from the robata. Lightly blackened lamb chops in a sweet-and-spicy glaze are tender, smoky, and ready for dipping in crimson Korean chili sauce. A starter of plump Wagyu and kimchi dumplings nearly bursting with spicy, rich beef expertly toe the line between crispy and moist.",0,0
894,Vermilion,Indian,2,"Andy Warhol would feel right at home among these silver-painted brick walls, high-fashion black-and-white photographs, metallic chairs, and curtains. The cool lounge atmosphere is best for dressed-up evenings or a celebratory Latin-tinged cocktail at the bar. Two expansive menus-one vegetarian, the other carnivorous-encompass Indian-inspired tapas and street foods. If feeling overhelmed by the choices, stick to the chef's specialties or go for the prix-fixe and let the kitchen decide. Meaty delicacies include spice-rubbed Mysore lamb chops with pink pickled onions. Gobi Portuguese lets tart tomatillo chutney and crunchy eggplant offset sweet coconut gravy and tender cauliflower. Shahi tukra pleases the palate with crisp fried semolina cakes drenched in caramel sauce.",0,0
895,Sunda,Fusion,2,"The Sunda shelf, an underwater outcropping that stretches along the coastline of Southeast Asia, connects the countries that provide culinary inspiration for this enormous River North lounge and restaurant. The beautiful people are naturally attracted to the clubby vibe Sunda radiates, complete with thumping music and a wide range of cocktail and sake selections. The seafood is as fresh as the vibe is sultry, with numerous raw and cooked options like tempura rock shrimp tossed with candied walnuts in a creamy honey aïoli; or maki like the ""tail of two tunas"" pairing yellowfin and super white tuna with pickled jalapeños and fried shallots. Meat-eaters won't go hungry with creative plates like lemongrass beef lollipops and oxtail potstickers.",0,0
896,NAHA,American,3,"There's a quiet elegance to Chef Carrie Nahabedian's dining room, a sleek, window-wrapped space with contemporary accents of concrete, wood, and greenery. Here, patrons aren't groupies checking off the latest table on their do list, but rather connoisseurs experiencing a magnificent meal with exceptional service. If your idea of relaxation starts with pre-dinner drinks, the sizable bar and smattering of tables in the front lounge are an open invitation to begin. Despite its understated environs, NAHA's sweeping carte of seasonally driven Mediterranean cuisine is anything but. Shining starters include succulent lamb boereg, a delicate phyllo-wrapped parcel of ground meat plated with strained yogurt, juicy red pomegranate arils, and refreshing watercress salad. Perfectly toothsome and loaded with seasonal produce, the risotto is always a hit, while entrées like pan-seared Arctic char dressed with beluga lentils, mustard seeds, and savory apple-celery broth are a breath of fresh air. Dessert highlights include the house sundae-a perennial favorite that's reimagined each season-and the gâteau Basque, a warm vanilla custard cake served with brown butter ice cream, corn pudding, and cubed pears.",1,1
897,RPM,Italian,2,"You'll want to bust out the Dolce & Gabbana for a sultry night at RPM. This see-and-be-seen scene starts at the wraparound Carrara marble bar and works its way to the mod black-and-white dining room, where sexy white leather chairs and booths don't detract from the pretty people on display. Even servers get into the spirit with white coats and skinny black ties. If you can tune out the diversions, the poster-sized menu of modern Italian antipasti, snacks, and family-style plates won't disappoint. Classically prepared peppered beef carpaccio and shaved parmesan is garnished with crispy mushrooms, while a hearty entrée of gnocchi is tossed with mild Italian sausage and rapini. Save room to share a plate of freshly fried bomboloni oozing with Nutella.",0,0
898,Saigon Sisters,Vietnamese,1,"The sign of a great restaurant is when the owner is on-site, and such is the case at this local hot spot, where Mary Nguyen Aregoni is as gregarious and welcoming as her staff. Named after Mary and sister, Theresa Nguyen, the lofty space belies its compact size with huge glass windows and high ceilings. Simple banquettes and wood tables are a perfect canvas for the vibrant Vietnamese cuisine that comes speeding out of the kitchen. Lunch is busy with business types ordering the likes of a fragrant, satisfying, and clear pho floating with soft noodles, bean sprouts, jalapeños, and cilantro. Meanwhile, noodles stir-fried with thinly sliced hoisin-glazed pork, char-grilled red pepper, and sliced avocado are a dream team of flavor and texture.",0,0
899,Gene & Georgetti,Steakhouse,4,"No, it's not a Hollywood set. This Italian-American steak joint is the real thing, and those wiseguys at the bar have been clinking their ice cubes in this wood-paneled room for decades. The historic spot, founded in 1941, is boisterous downstairs with the aforementioned regulars and guys grabbing a bite; upstairs is more refined for local politico lunches and a bit of old-school romance at dinner. Gene & Georgetti is a steakhouse with an Italian bloodline, prominently displayed in the heaping helping of fried peperoncini and bell peppers with the signature ""chicken alla Joe."" The cottage fries (oversized potato planks that come with most entrées) might necessitate a doggie bag, but all the better to leave room for a slice of classic carrot cake.",0,0
900,Terzo Piano,Italian,3,"Whether you're taking in the modern masterpieces at the Art Institute or simply enjoying lunch or cocktails on the sculpture-filled garden terrace, Terzo Piano is a feast for all the senses. The windowed white room is mod and minimalist, allowing the artistry of the Mediterranean-influenced menu to shine brightly at each table. With Tony Mantuano overseeing the kitchen, Italian influences find their way into many seasonal dishes. Charred tomato crème fraîche lends luxurious smokiness and a tart streak to tender chicken Milanese resting on roasted cipollini purée; and agnolotti bursting with a sweet pea-ricotta filling find savory balance with shards of crispy pancetta. As an added bonus, museum members receive a 10 percent discount on the meal.",0,0
901,Bohemian House,Eastern European,2,"This wickedly stylish ""house"" is exactly what River North needed to shake it up-a truly unique restaurant serving up delicious Czech, Austrian, and Hungarian cuisines. The stunning beer hall-meets-art nouveau interior (think reclaimed wood beams, stunning tiles arching over a semi-open kitchen, sky-blue tufted leather couches and Persian rugs) is worth a visit alone. No detail is overlooked. Delightfully, the food is amazingly tasty and just as pretty to look at. Don't miss the open-faced schnitzel sandwich, highlighting juicy pork over apple and kohlrabi slaw, aged Gouda, a fried egg, and drizzle of coarse mustard. Also a must do? The warm blueberry kolacky, a traditional Czech cookie filled with blueberry coulis and served with lemon curd and blueberry-sour cream ice cream.",0,0
902,Avec,Mediterranean,2,"Fans have been clamoring for the dinner plates at this West Randolph mainstay for more than a decade-and now that lunch is on the menu, it's official: Avec is a non-stop hangout. It's a fun vibe, as diners are tightly packed at a long counter and communal seating in the chic wood plank encased room, and servers do a good job attending to the crowd. Mediterranean flavors factor prominently in the kitchen's stimulating creations, like a kale and carrot salad dressed with delightfully herbaceous and spicy green harissa as well as sunflower seeds for crunch. A thick slice of excellent whole grain bread spread with walnut-beet muhamarra is the foundation of an open-faced roasted salmon sandwich, and other delights-there are many-come and go with the seasons.",0,0
903,Beatrix,International,2,"From a spartan façade to an industrial décor, Beatrix is the epitome of cool. Then consider its many meal options, popular tunes, and trendy scene rife with hotel guests from the adjacent Aloft, and know why it's jamming. Servers don stylish hairdos and tattoos to match the vibe while attending to the giant room scattered with seats and a coffee bar dispensing excellent local brews. Meanwhile, the menu veers from creative to quirky with pleasing results. A spring pea soup highlights aroma, flavor, and texture when shot with mint, ricotta, and croutons. Salads may headline, but mains like roasted chili- and chocolate-glazed salmon are a smoky surprise. End with the apple strudel flavored with caramelized brown sugar-it's big in size and faultless in flavor.",0,0
904,Benny's Chop House,Steakhouse,3,"Old-school service meets modern elegance at Benny's Chop House. A far cry from the clubby, masculine steakhouses of yesteryear and just a stone's throw from the Magnificent Mile, this expansive but welcoming space goes for understated glamour, with tasteful inlaid wood and burgundy columns offset by natural stone walls, white birch branches, and a marble bar. Though Benny's steaks are the draw, those prime cuts of filet mignon and ribeye are matched by fresh seafood like simply roasted bone-in halibut fillet and classic raw bar towers, along with a variety of pastas and salads. A trio of sliders featuring mini portions of Benny's burger, crab cake, and sliced filet with horseradish cream elevate the idea of bar snacks to new heights.",0,0
905,Blackbird,Contemporary,3,"The bright, very contemporary boxy white façade is a brilliant contrast to its somewhat missable street-just as it has been since its 1997 opening. Inside the white and steel space, find clean lines and a modern aesthetic that moves from the black-and-white artwork to the bare tables and vases that seem to pop with colorful flowers. Service can be brusque, but that never seems to deter the crowds from packing in. Expect a wait. A strong sense of style extends to the cuisine; this is a serious kitchen with an eye on artistic detail and elegance. The à la carte menu may offer dishes like duck rillettes spread on a sunflower seed cracker studded with poppy, raw sesame, and pumpkin seeds as well as compressed apple for a tart counterpoint to the rich duck. Meaty abalone mushroom confit is served with tiny and delicate sweet potato tortellini, braised mustard greens, and green apple in a soy-kissed broth. Finish on a sweet note with the Bourbon gooey butter cake, inventively deconstructed and served with crushed and shatter-thin sheets of caramelized strudel, toasted pecans, and a delectable whoosh of wonderfully seasonal pumpkin pie filling, all topped with whipped goat cheese.",1,1
906,Mastro's,Steakhouse,4,"Mastro's may be relatively young on the Windy City's steakhouse scene, but it shows up with the swagger of an old pro. Black SUVs unload VIPs in front of the revolving door, which leads to a gleaming wall of bottles at the gilded bar. Live lounge music may take the level of conversation up a notch, but sip on a shaken martini to blank out the surrounding din. Steaks on screaming hot platters come unadorned unless otherwise listed, and servers will happily rattle off recommendations for toppings, sauces, and crusts. Salads like Mastro's house version, a local favorite stocked with chopped jumbo shrimp and a giant steamed prawn, are hearty (read: oversized), but smaller portions are on offer so you can leave room for the renowned butter cake.",0,0
907,Salero,Spanish,2,"Nestled in among neighboring Randolph Street hangouts, this upscale newbie holds its own. Accented by wood details set aglow with pillar candles and a turquoise wall hung with steer horns, the space boasts a chic front bar area for cocktails and a dining room that welcomes guests in for a meal . A contemporary vision of Spanish cuisine turns out pintxos to start-try the Gilda, a single bite skewer featuring a brown anchovy, pickled guindilla pepper, and a manzanilla olive. Follow this up with a slick risotto-paella hybrid; or boneless roasted quail stuffed with chorizo and set over wilted spinach with toasted pine nuts. For dessert, order the manzana to receive a miniature apple cake dressed with rosemary crumble, cider reduction, and goat cheese ice cream.",0,0
908,Sable Kitchen & Bar,American,2,"Tucked into the spacious and beautiful Hotel Palomar, Sable Kitchen & Bar is a sleek, sultry, and sophisticated number, fitted out with different dining areas. There's the stunning 40-foot bar, tricked out in gorgeous dark paneling, soft leather seats, and unique light fixtures. The expansive dining room is equally elegant and urbane, attracting dates looking for more intimacy or friends catching up over dinner.The chef manning the ship here is Lawrence Letrero, and an evening in his very capable hands might entail a decadently spicy and wonderfully complex starter of shrimp and roasted squash curry. Then diners may graduate to crispy, juicy adobo pork belly, served with sticky rice, and a pickled green papaya salad topped with a fried farm egg.",0,0
909,GT Fish & Oyster,Seafood,2,"Quaint seaside shacks have nothing on this urban spot that exudes nautical chic. A boomerang-shaped communal table by the raw bar makes a perfect oyster-slurping perch. Lead fishing weights keep napkins in place on nautically styled, brass-edged tables, lined up under an enormous chalkboard-style mural of a jaunty swordfish skeleton. Pescatarians savor the numerous seafood dishes meant for sharing, but those who forego fish are limited to three meat options. Rectangular crab cakes, stuffed to the gills with sweet meat, get a crunchy sear on all sides. Salade Niçoise spotlights pristine slices of fresh tuna and snappy green beans in a cider-mustard dressing. Key lime pie, a traditional meal-ender, is transformed into light layers of curd and cake in a glass jar.",0,0
910,Brindille,French,4,"This posh bistro is located just steps away from NAHA, it's impressive sister restaurant from cousins Carrie and Michael Nahabedian. Hushed and intimate, the dining room is awash with a palette of soothing greys and dressed up with herringbone floors along with black-and-white photography. Brindille's menu isn't a sequel to NAHA's contemporary Mediterranean fare, but instead bears a strong Parisian accent influenced by the chef's love of French cuisine. Roasted chestnuts are whirled into a creamy soup and poured over compressed apple, wild mushrooms, and puffed rice. Spot-on Dover sole meuniere is plated with a purée of watercress and golden-crisp pommes rissolées. And for dessert, preserved cherries are just one option to fill the baked-to-order almond clafoutis.",0,0
911,Lou Mitchell's,American,1,"At the top of Chicago's list of beloved names is Lou Mitchell. This eponymous diner is by no means an elegant affair, but thanks to its delicious omelets and iconic crowd, it has been on the Windy City's must-eat list since 1923. Don't panic at the length of the lines: they are long but move fast, and free doughnut holes (one of the restaurant's signature baked goods) make the wait go faster. Back to those omelets: they may be made with mere eggs, like everyone else's, but somehow these are lighter and fluffier, almost like a soufflé, stuffed with feta, spinach, onions, or any other ingredients of your choice. They arrive in skillets with an Idaho-sized helping of potatoes. The best part? Everyone gets a swirl of soft-serve at the meal's end.",0,0
912,Grace,Contemporary,4,"Ask a passing foodie to name one of Chicago's most elegant and sophisticated restaurants and they'll probably say Grace. This room is as handsome as it is urbane and provides a supremely comfortable environment for those spending an evening discovering the culinary wizardry of Curtis Duffy. You'll be presented with a choice between two seasonally changing menus: ""Fauna"" or, for vegetarians, ""Flora."" Opt for the wine pairings and you're done on the decision making for the night. Trying to keep track of the ingredients of each dish will nullify the benefit of the wine, so instead just marvel at the clever presentation and dig in-because taste is what this food is all about. The dishes are intricate and elaborately constructed, with herbs playing an integral part rather than merely being a garnish. Occasionally your taste buds will get a little slap, perhaps with the odd Thai or Vietnamese flavor, and the courses will fly by. This style of cooking is very labor-intensive and if you want to learn more, then take advantage of their offer of a post-prandial kitchen tour.",3,1
913,Baffo,Italian,3,"As the flagship fine dining experience of Eataly's mega food mecca, Baffo brings the Mario Batali brand of contemporary Italian cuisine to downtown Chicago. Dim lighting and stylized black-and-white accents add drama to the formal white-tablecloth space, which strives for sophistication despite stutter-start service that needs a bit more fine tuning to shine like a true Batali star. Thanks to truly top-notch ingredients, simple dishes like poached veal tongue with spicy giardiniera and caramelized onions stand out on the menu. Though pastas can verge on the edge of too al dente, braised short rib is perfectly fork-tender with a crunchy, buttery breadcrumb topping and rustic braised greens primed for soaking up the meat's rich jus.",0,0
914,The Purple Pig,Mediterranean,2,"This Windy City haunt is so popular that the patio provides valuable real estate all year long by way of screens and heat lamps. If you are able to score a seat inside, where tightly packed tables bolster the accommodations, you'll enjoy a view of the kitchen from the Carrara marble bar. The extensive small plates menu is primed for pairing with the wine list, and unusual cuts of meat-like a panini with pork heart-take precedence. Inspired by a Chicago beef, this ciabatta roll is moistened with jus, stuffed full of pork, and dressed with sweet peppers and spicy-tangy giardiniera. A plethora of charcuterie, fried bites, and spreads like whipped feta with cucumbers guarantees all who sip and sup here leave with a full belly and wine-stained mouth.",0,0
915,Michael Jordan's,Steakhouse,3,"Leave your dated 1993 Bulls jersey in the closet for a meal at this swanky steakhouse, tucked just off the lobby of the InterContinental Hotel. Leather and velvet accents telegraph an upscale vibe, and references to His Airness are subtle-from oversized sepia photographs of basketball netting to a 23-layer chocolate cake for dessert. A glass of Amarone with a dry-aged Porterhouse is always a slam-dunk, but the kitchen also turns out pleasing modern twists on steakhouse classics. Chicago's famous Italian beef gets an upgrade with smoked ribeye and aged provolone. Similarly, the traditional wedge salad is presented as a halved small head of baby romaine, layered here with creamy Wisconsin blue cheese and thick slabs of crispy bacon.",0,0
916,Joe's,American,4,"Despite the ample neighborhood competition, this outpost of the original Miami seafood, steak, and stone crab palace does just fine up north. Clubby, masculine décor fashions a classic scene, while business diners and lively martini-toasting groups keep the leather booths full from lunch through dinner. Stone crab claws accompanied by signature mustard sauce are shared by nearly every table, followed by decadent dishes like a bone-in filet with their simple yet delicious coriander-spiked seasoning. Americana sides like Jennie's fontina and asiago mashed potatoes, or grilled tomatoes topped with cheesy spinach pesto, are ample enough to share. Joe's Key lime pie is rightly famous, but other retro sweets like coconut cream pie are worth a forkful.",0,0
917,Labriola,Italian,2,"Supersizing his popular Oak Brook café, baker Rich Labriola expands his eponymous empire just off Michigan Avenue. The hangar-sized space is three operations in one: a café for pastries and casual bites; a bar; and a full-scale restaurant. Though the décor takes cues from French brasseries, the menus have a decidedly Italian focus. No matter where you're seated, you can sample the quality imported salumi and formaggio selections like Parma ham and Granduca pecorino, accompanied by charred bread and sharp chutney. Neopolitan pizzas, fritto misto, and house-made pastas like bucatini all'Amatriciana don't disappoint, and tiramisù gets a new twist in a mélange of velvety smooth chocolate mousse, espresso-infused mascarpone, and coffee-soaked cake cubes.",0,0
918,David Burke's Primehouse,Steakhouse,3,"Banish thoughts of musty wood-paneled rooms from your mind and unwind at this chic-and slightly tongue-in-cheek-steakhouse in the boutique James Hotel. Rawhide tablecloths and masculine wood-and-rope décor elements hint at the ranch and open range, though the cocktails and young, trendy clientele at the accompanying bar are strictly urban. The all-American menu offers a wide selection of top-notch beef and hearty sides to match. Skewered cubes of maple syrup-smothered, black pepper-dusted bacon are a playful snack to share, a poppable prelude to the carnivorous courses to follow. Bone-in steaks like the 8-ounce filet are juicy and flavor-packed; many cuts are aged in-house in a Himalayan salt-tiled room for prime attention and coddling.",0,0
919,Union Sushi + Barbeque Bar,Japanese,2,"The slogan of this big, bustling restaurant is ""Uniting Japanese culinary tradition with a distinctly American persona,"" which roughly translates to ""Japanese food with a party hat on."" The cocktails are good, the noise levels are high, and there are more tattoos in the room than a Yakuza convention. The menu will take forever to read so just go directly to their two specialties-the assorted sushi rolls, some of which use black rice, and meats and fish expertly cooked over an open flame on the seriously hot robata. The ingredients are good and the flavor combinations don't get silly. Just remember that sharing is the key to keeping that final check in check, especially as the T-shirted staff are masters of upselling with an iPad.",0,0
920,Paramount Room,Gastropub,2,"Though a few blocks north of the hot-and-heavy Fulton Market food scene, this edgy joint, equal parts gastropub and dive bar, more than holds its own. To start, make like the cool kids and order something from the well-stocked bar: Moscow Mules are presented properly in frosty copper mugs, killer Bloody Marys are fortified by skewers of huge olives and blocks of dill Havarti, and the beer list boasts there's ""no crap on tap"". Paramount's menu features dishes that make the most of top-quality ingredients, like a plump burger crafted from 100 percent Wagyu beef on a toasted brioche bun. Daily specials have featured a trio of sweet and zesty pulled pork sliders sided by a heap of crisp and crunchy tempura-style green beans.",0,0
921,Mercat a la Planxa,Spanish,2,"Within a cavernous space in the Renaissance Blackstone hotel, Mercat a la Planxa recreates the hustle and bustle of a Spanish marketplace with an extensive menu of Catalan tapas. The dining room's tightly packed tables are perfect for grazing, and soaring ceilings along with cathedral windows overlooking Grant Park impress locals and out-of-towners alike. Plump, crunchy gambas al ajillo are bathed in buttery garlic sauce with a hint of lemon, and servers add to the excitement by drizzling jus over skewers of bacon-wrapped lamb loin medallions at the table. This is the kind of place where nary a splash of sauce is left behind, so use those slices of brioche-with a swipe of sweet onion purée for good measure-to sop up every last delicious drop.",0,0
922,Au Cheval,American,2,"This corner bar on Randolph Street's restaurant row may be dim, but it's got a few glittering edges. The reel-to-reel in the doorway lends a retro feel, but the rest is decidedly cushy. Late-night revelers prefer to sit at tufted leather booths or savor beers at the zinc-topped bar, rather than endure a wait for a table in the raucous space. Bartenders work just as hard as line cooks until the wee hours. The kitchen puts a highfalutin spin on simple bar eats. In-house butchers craft 32-ounce pork Porterhouses for sharing; foie gras for folding into fluffy scrambled eggs; and house-made sausages for bologna sandwiches that go well beyond a kid's wildest dreams. Thin griddled cheeseburger patties are perked up by maple syrup-glazed peppered bacon.",0,0
923,The Franklin Room,American,2,"With a motto like ""Ladies and Gentlemen Welcome,"" it's no surprise that the subterranean space housing this modern-day tavern and whiskey bar is as inviting as they come. Surrounded by backlit bottles of top-notch spirits under wrought-iron latticework light panels, guests gather for convivial conversation and great drinks. Fans of Bourbon will delight in the Derby Day Mule, which swaps out vodka for Buffalo Trace. Pair your libation with rib-sticking dishes like a sandwich of garlic- and balsamic vinegar-roasted portobello mushroom caps layered with a runny egg, grilled tomato, and blue cheese; or a steaming bowl of braised duck soup complete with thick and silky pappardelle. End on a high note-think Bourbon-infused milkshake with house-made ice cream, natch.",0,0
924,Side Door,Gastropub,2,"In a city with no shortage of steakhouses, Side Door dares to be different. It's the casual arm of Lawry's in the historic McCormick Mansion, offering the same quality and service without the power lunch vibe. Comfy leather banquettes and wide wooden tables are well spaced throughout the bi-level restaurant, offering a respite for shoppers to relax with a cheese plate and craft beer flight. Share an order of prime rib poutine among friends-it's drenched in beef gravy and pepper jack cheese-or go whole hog with the prime rib sandwich, which is hand-carved to order and presented tableside with horseradish cream and au jus. For something lighter but just as pleasurable, try the kale Caesar, with white anchovies and a delicately creamy garlic dressing.",0,0
925,Girl & The Goat,Contemporary,2,"The revolving door never stops turning as Girl & The Goat's party keeps going. Even on a Monday night, guests linger for hours, shouting over the din at this sceney but always friendly stunner. Appropriately rustic wooden pillars and beams connect a warren of seating areas, from elevated platforms to banquettes to dim private corner nooks. A pick-your-own-protein adventure, the menu is organized by ingredient with a dedicated section for goat. Paper-thin goat carpaccio is dusted with fried capers, beads of smoked trout roe, and an olive-maple vinaigrette. Red currants brighten the luxe meatiness of wood-fired scallops with subtly smoked uni cream. The kitchen will even send out mini portions of menu items for solo diners-a truly thoughtful touch.",0,0
926,Dolce,Italian,2,"With locations in Miami and Atlanta, Dolce's newest outpost lands in Chicago's popular River North neighborhood, tucked into the lobby of the stunning, Cubist-influenced Godfrey boutique hotel. The spacious dining room features a sleek interior with dark wood grain tiles, orange leather furnishings, tweed-lined banquettes, and enormous windows. Dolce offers a chic take on Italian dining, with a menu featuring pizzas, house-made pastas, and entrées like veal Milanese or fennel pollen-dusted roasted chicken. Try the cool watermelon salad studded with heirloom tomatoes, crumbled goat cheese, pea shoots, mint, and toasted pumpkin seeds. The pappardelle alla Bolognese arrives irresistibly silky and dressed in a wickedly good beef, pork, and veal ragù.",0,0
927,¡Hello Tacos! De Cero,Mexican,2,"As a muy popular member of restaurant row, this spot takes the traditional taqueria and turns it on its head...with spice! Lively music keeps the energy level high, though low lighting lends a cozy vibe to the sleek wood-dominated space. Two rooms, each equipped with a bar, make it easy to get started with a strawberry-mint margarita or Mexican beer. Don't let the name change fool you; ¡Hello Tacos! is still everything you've come to love about De Cero over the years. Tacos are made with hand-pressed corn tortillas and ordered individually, letting diners sample a range of fillings including rich duck confit and spicy corn salsa. Ample chunks of carnitas with habanero salsa and julienned radish is another fave, while jalapeño-marinated skirt steak tortas are pressed to order and ooze with melting Chihuahua.",0,0
928,Rural Society,Steakhouse,3,"This buzzy Argentinean steakhouse from prolific Chef Jose Garces brings a touch of international flair to Chicago's already meat-heavy roster. The ranch-inspired space is smart and upscale, with oversized iron chandeliers, framed photos of show cattle, and a painted wood kitchen from which a wood-fired oven and grill fill the air with a smoky aroma. In addition to excellent cuts of beef, Rural Society grills up stellar Maine lobster, chicken, and chops, while the oven produces mouthwatering Argentinean pizzas and homemade-spiced sausages. Be sure to try the plana di hierro and fritas, a South American version of traditional steak frites that boasts a subtly smoky flavor and a creamy, chili-spiced butter dip for those crispy chips.",0,0
929,Oak + Char,American,2,"Despite its panoply of high-profile neighbors, this convivial haunt manages to maintain a relaxed, mellow vibe. Whether lounging over drinks and a bite from the innovative cocktail list and bar snacks menu, grabbing a quick soup-and-sandwich lunch, or going all out for dinner, guests are welcomed to sip, nibble, and chat as long as they like. The self-described ""modern Midwestern"" menu pulls influences and ingredients from around the globe, yet maintains a distinctly American feel in dishes like cotton cake-an airy Japanese-style cheesecake kept light with streaks of persimmon jam and basil streusel. Smoky wood-grilled eggplant pairs with red pepper jam on a hearty ciabatta sandwich, with irresistibly salty homemade potato chips straight from the fryer.",0,0
930,Sumi Robata Bar,Japanese,2,"There's a degree of authenticity to this traditional robata bar and that includes the discreet entrance, although a spacious patio ultimately lets you know you're not in downtown Tokyo. Sit at the counter to best appreciate their specialty-the Japanese art of grilling. For a good value lunch look no further than the bento boxes, but come at night and you'll be able to try a variety of grilled items where the natural flavors shine through, whether that's Wagyu beef or crab. You can also try more unusual cuts that you may hitherto have avoided, such as chicken heart or tail. The service is smiley, helpful, and sincere. The guys behind the counter have a more serious countenance-well, good grilling is serious business.",0,0
931,Sushi Dokku,Japanese,2,"Creatively adorned nigiri is the featured attraction at this hip sushi-ya that's all wood planks, stainless steel, chunky tables, and hefty benches. Just one piece of Sushi Dokku's supple cuts showcasing quality and technique is not enough-thankfully each nigiri order is served as pairs. Among the terrific selection, enjoy the likes of hamachi sporting a spicy mix of shredded Napa cabbage, daikon, and red chili; or salmon dressed with a sweet ginger-soy sauce and fried ginger chips. South Pacific sea bream is deliciously embellished with a drizzle of smoky tomato and black sea salt. Those who wish to branch out from sushi should go for tako yaki (crispy fried octopus croquettes), grilled hamachi collar, or a brownie-crusted green tea-cheesecake.",0,0
932,Greek Islands,Greek,1,"This Greektown retreat sports multiple dining areas as well as a perpetually bustling bar. Diners sup among a Disney-fied décor of faux-terraces and balconies, overhangs topped by terra-cotta tiles, and a trellised ceiling entwined with artificial greenery. The chance of a courteous someone whose name ends in ""os"" attending to you is good, but it's the food that has kept the joint hopping for more than 40 years. Salads are crisp and refreshing, pan-seared cheese is flambéed tableside, and the fresh seafood doesn't disappoint: fish are grilled whole, filleted, and dressed simply with herbs, a few glugs of olive oil, and squeeze of lemon. Specialties include spetsofai, house-made sausage sautéed with onions and peppers in a red wine- and tomato-sauce.",0,0
933,High Five Ramen,Japanese,1,"This re-purposed industrial setting is a hipster dining hall serving two hot foodie trends under one roof. The bulk of the sprawling space is devoted to Green Street Smoked Meats, a barbecue joint where crowds of cool kids sit side-by-side downing beers and heaps of pulled pork, brisket, and Frito pie. More worthy of attention, however, is High Five Ramen, a downstairs nook where the queue for one of its 16-seats starts early. Once inside, slurp a bowl of the signature, crazy-spicy broth. Loaded with thin alkaline noodles, a slow-cooked egg, roasted pork belly, locally grown sprouts, and black garlic oil, this unique rendition is worth the burn. For sweet, icy relief, sip on a slushy tiki cocktail-then wipe your brow and dig back in.",0,0
934,Little Goat Diner,American,2,"Every Chicago neighborhood needs a good diner and in the booming West Loop, this enthusiastic homage to the reliable road trip stopover fits in perfectly. The décor gives a wink and a nod to classic design with retro booths, spinning chrome barstools, and blue-rimmed plates, but the top-quality materials keep it on the modern side. A morning-to-night menu of amped-up diner favorites can be had no matter the hour: craving a shrimp cocktail at 7:00 A.M.? Five jumbo fried shrimp wrapped in somen noodles are ready to go. The Goat Almighty burger lives up to its name with fatty beef brisket, saucy pulled pork, and a ground goat patty. Before hitting the road, grab a cup of Stumptown-and maybe a s'mores cookie-from LG Bread, the next-door bakery and coffee bar.",0,0
935,Prosecco,Italian,2,"No matter the hour, it's always time for bubbly at Prosecco, where a complimentary flute of the namesake Italian sparkler starts each meal. This fizzy wine inspires the restaurant's elegant décor, from creamy pale walls and damask drapes to travertine floors. Sit at the long wooden bar or in one of the well-appointed dining rooms for a second glass chosen from the long list of frizzante and spumante wines. Hearty dishes spanning the many regions of Italy cut through the heady bubbles. Carpaccio selections include the classic air-dried bresaola as well as whisper-thin seared rare duck breast. Saltimbocca di vitello marries tender veal medallions with crispy Prosciutto di Parma and creamy mozzarella, with hints of sage in the tomato-brandy sauce.",0,0
936,Tre Soldi,Italian,2,"Set a few steps above street level, Tre Soldi's tomato-red awning and floor-to-ceiling windows beckon Michigan Avenue shoppers and business lunchers. Inside, splashes of red-and-white allude subtly to those classic red-sauce joints complete with checkered tablecloths, but glossy ceramic-tiled columns and Italian stone floors up the ante. Rome and its surroundings inspire the menu and all-Italian wine list. Local Slagel Family Farm's beef becomes carpaccio, shingled on the plate and drizzled with tangy mustard aïoli, fresh parsley, and celery leaves. Thin-crust pizzas strewn with quality ingredients like cavolo nero, featuring caramelized onions and pecorino, are large enough to share. Finish with dark chocolate-hazelnut tarts, perfectly balanced by apricot jam.",0,0
937,The Boarding House,International,2,"The long-awaited passion project from Chicago master sommelier Alpana Singh, The Boarding House has thrown its doors open to four floors of grandeur. The impressively shimmering wine glass clusters dangling in the first floor bar lead way to the upper dining room, which pulls out all the stops by virtue of its arched, mullioned windows and an installation made from more than 4,000 green wine bottles. Small and larger plates make sharing an appealing proposition. House-made tagliolini ribbons tossed with fresh peas, mint, and pickled ramps are bright and zesty. Garlic lovers use crispy chicken thighs to sop up every last bit of aromatic green-garlic pistou. Scoops of sour cherry gelée and merlot-chocolate chip ice cream crown rich brownies for dessert.",0,0
938,Momotaro,Japanese,2,"Boka Restaurant Group's stunning West Loop canteen embraces a fantastical view of Japanese dining. An impressive selection of imported whiskies is listed on a retro-style departure board; a private dining room upstairs is styled to resemble a mid-century corporate boardroom; and a traditional izakaya beckons diners downstairs. Consistently packed, the AvroKO-designed space boasts numerous kitchens churning out a wide range of dishes. Creative bites abound in the chef's omakase featuring torched baby squid wrapped in nori. Then a Hawaiian seaweed salad with diced nopales may be tailed by robata-grilled Wagyu skirt steak with foie gras, shisito pepper, and yuzu kosho. The steamed yuzu pudding cake is just one example of the surprisingly strong dessert roster.",0,0
939,Nellcôte,Italian,2,"The orange canopy above Nellcôte's entrance and stylish plaque would not look out of place on the Côte d'Azur. Named after the villa where the Rolling Stones recorded their iconic Exile on Main Street, this West Loop rock star-decked out with a lacquered ivory bar, marble staircase, and antique chandeliers-feels like a playground for the glam. Vases of dried lavender evoke scents of the Mediterranean, as do the kitchen's creations, which feature homemade ravioli filled with favas, a poached egg, and parmesan broth. A hearty and succulent Berkshire pork chop with sweet roasted yams and spicy grated horseradish needs no sides; whereas black pepper semifreddo between chocolate shortbread is particularly memorable when paired with red wine-poached pears.",0,0
940,Maude's Liquor Bar,French,2,"Don't be fooled by the aged patina of this sexy boîte: though a few items like the overstuffed curio cabinet and salvaged French metal chairs are true antiques, this chicly disheveled hang has been hiding out on West Randolph for only a few years. Contemporary and classic cocktails like a violet-tinged Aviator are served in champagne coupes, adding to the vintage atmosphere. Head to the second-floor bar to snack on oysters and frites, or fill up on Francophile comfort food under the glow of mismatched crystal chandeliers. Juicy, garlicky Toulouse-style pork sausage is served whole over bacon-stewed lentils, and smashed potatoes are rich with chicken jus. Sugar fiends will delight in the crème brûlée, which sports the perfect crackling sugar veneer.",0,0
941,graham elliot Bistro,American,2,"It's not likely you'll see peripatetic MasterChef Graham Elliot working the line at this bistro any time soon, but his namesake retains the pizzazz it brought years ago as a newcomer to the West Loop. Dramatic backlighting, colorful mosaics, and modern stained glass brighten the narrow, high-ceilinged space. The kitchen hums along in time to music bouncing off polished concrete floors. Simple comfort food goes upscale with the kitchen's cleverly deconstructed dishes. A breakfast-for-dinner twist on salmon becomes a perfectly seared fillet atop a dilled cream cheese ""schmear;"" an everything bagel tuile and onion jam drive the point home. Chicken noodle soup becomes pillowy mousseline-filled agnolotti on a bed of sunchoke purée and roasted carrots.",0,0
942,Grange Hall Burger Bar,American,1,"American Gothic accents (think Grant Wood) invade the big city at Grange Hall, where a down-on-the-farm vibe is telegraphed loud and clear through swinging barn doors, quilted panels hanging above the lunch counter, and mismatched knit napkins set atop tables with wooden chairs and stools. The glassed-in pie kitchen in the back hints dessert won't be an afterthought. Choose your own adventure when building a burger, starting with a six- or nine-ounce grass-fed beef patty and adding toppings like Midwestern cheeses, smoked bacon, jalapeños, or homemade pickles. If a wedge of strawberry rhubarb pie or Bourbon-spiked milkshake is calling your name (especially when freshly churned ice cream is involved), go easy on those hand-cut farmhouse chili fries.",0,0
943,Jaipur,Indian,2,"Business execs expecting the ubiquitous lunch buffet will be sorely disappointed by Jaipur-that is until they realize this popular weekday spot serves an affordable full-service lunch special that brings the buffet to your table in a parade of hammered copper katoris. In the evening, locals fill every sleek, nail-studded chair in the refined dining room as they await plates of boldly flavored Indian cooking. The broad menu features a lengthy selection of fresh and authentically treated favorites, most of which are available as part of the bountiful lunch special. Staples on the vast à la carte menu may include aloo papdi chaat; a rich and creamy chicken korma; spiced carrot soup; and scarlet-red tandoori chicken, served with garlic naan.",0,0
944,The Publican,Gastropub,2,"The phrase ""meat market"" has many connotations at The Publican: everything about this bustling Fulton Market spot is communal, from the sprawling U-shaped table that dominates the space and the penned-in booths lining the perimeter to the sink outside the washrooms. That said, the ubiquitous pig-centric décor gives a more straightforward idea of what you'll find on the menu. As expected, pork takes precedence here with rillettes, platters of paper-thin aged ham slices, and house-made blood sausage to pair with one of the superlative beer selections. Weekend brunch gets in on the game with thickly sliced Publican bacon basted with Burton's maple syrup, or savory mushroom-and-chard French toast topped with roasted tomato and a fried egg.",0,0
945,Les Nomades,French,4,"A giddy excitement bubbles through the air at Les Nomades, and with good reason: this intimate, charming restaurant feels like a secret hideaway within a gated Streeterville brownstone. Owner Mary Beth Liccioni welcomes all as if they were old friends, seating guests among the graciously arranged fresh flowers, framed artwork, and linen-topped tables. Though the fragrant herb-loaded lavash presented at each table is good enough to make an entire meal out of, save room for entrées like grilled Scottish salmon, served medium-rare with a colorful, flavorful mélange of beets, cucumber, and black olive tapenade. A single translucent langoustine raviolo duets on a plate with tempura soft shell crab, both enhanced by harissa- and saffron-spiked rouille.",0,0
946,Chicago Curry House,Indian,1,"Maybe you sniff the wafting aromas of ginger, garlic, and cumin first; maybe you hear the sitar music tinkling its welcoming notes as you enter. Either way, you know immediately that Chicago Curry House is a commendable showcase of Indian and Nepalese cuisine. The lunch buffet lets you eat your fill for under $12, with crispy pappadum, baskets of fresh naan, and must-have curries like the Nepalese khasi ko maasu with chunks of bone-in stewed goat in a velvety cardamom- and black pepper-sauce. Indian butter chicken, creamy and rich in a tomato- and garam masala-spiced stew, is equally sumptuous. À la carte offerings are even more extensive. The staff has helpful suggestions for dealing with the area's draconian parking restrictions, so call ahead for tips.",0,0
947,Indian Garden,Indian,2,"Frequent diners know it as ""The IG,"" but first-timers will appreciate the copious lunch buffet as much as the doctors, med students, and locals. These faithful droves routinely make the trip up a few flights of stairs to get their pakora and tandoori fix on, among kitschy but ornate touches like richly colored fabrics and wafting incense. Though the à la carte menu offers Northern Indian dishes brought to the table in shiny copper vessels, the lunch buffet covers all bases with vegetarian, chicken, and lamb items. Staples like saag, dal, naan, and basmati rice are freshly made. Bhuna gosht mixes succulent lamb with tomatoes, onions, and spices; while lassi or masala tea provide refreshment along with a decent selection of wine, beer, and cocktails.",0,0
948,Tru,Contemporary,4,"Fine dining at Tru has a strong air of formality that extends from the service team to the moneyed, well-dressed clientele. Beyond the discreet exterior, find an intimate lounge with a spotlit and vivid blue sculpture. Decorative branches and net curtains divide the cavernous space; while white walls adorned with Warhol lithographs lend a luxe-gallery feel. Leather and velvet banquettes surrounding well-spaced tables are popular for quiet gatherings or romantic interludes. The variety of dining options begins with an excellent prix-fixe, extending all the way up to a deep-pocketed caviar selection. However, the menu fulfills its literal promise of exploring Chef Anthony Martin's very modern kitchen. Superlative talent is abundantly clear in the smooth and silky foie gras covered in a thin shell of sugar and counterbalanced by segments of blood orange. Succulent and pearly white halibut is seared to perfection and seasoned with a warm, chive-infused cream sauce, while Berkshire pork is the center of an impeccable presentation of ""petit vegetables"" including brilliantly crisp and tender peas. Solid desserts include an apple strudel filled with golden currants and flanked by an icy scoop of pear sorbet. Splurge on the extraordinary wine pairings.",1,1
949,Brasserie by LM,French,2,"Taking its cue from the neighborhood cafés that dot the boulevards of Paris, Brasserie by LM brings a bit of stylish French spirit to Michigan Avenue. Despite its chi-chi surroundings at the Essex Inn across from Grant Park, this is an understated modern diner, serving up affordably priced bistro fare from morning to night. The croque monsieur is a totem of indulgence, layered with ham and béchamel, then lavishly buttered for grilling and blanketed with melted cheese. Skin-on pommes frites pair pleasantly with the sandwich, but grilled Caesar salad drizzled with a garlicky dressing is slightly more inculpable. Splurge on the signature teurgoule, a classic rice pudding from Normandy made with plump, toothsome grains and heaps of cinnamon.",0,0
950,Farmhouse,Gastropub,2,"Like shaking the hand of your local farmer, grab the pitchfork door handles of Farmhouse and you'll be almost as close to the source of your food. Much of the décor is salvaged and much of the menu is procured right from the Midwest. From Indiana chicken to Michigan wine, local is more than a buzzword. Exposed brick, rough-hewn wood, and wire-encased filament bulbs make it the quintessential modern tavern. Highlights of the harvest headline each course. Whole-grain mustard dresses up a vibrant (and requisite) beet salad. Nueske's bacon is the star in a rustic BLT, accompanied by Klug Farms peaches tossed with balsamic dressing. Cream cheese-frosted carrot bread pudding is fragrant from autumn spices, layered with a golden raisin purée and nutmeg crunch.",0,0
951,Giordano's,Pizza,1,"Value, friendly service, and delicious deep-dish pizza make Giordano's a crowd sweetheart. With several locations dotting the city and suburbs, this restaurant has been gratifying locals with comforting Italian-American fare for years. Come during the week-service picks up especially at dinner-to avoid the cacophony. Giordano's menu includes your typical salads, pastas, et al., but you'd do well to save room for the real star: the deep-dish. Bring backup because this pie could feed a small country. The spinach version arrives on a buttery pastry crust, filled with spreads of sautéed (or steamed) spinach with tomato sauce, and topped with mozzarella and parmesan. For those cold, windy nights, opt for delivery-their website sketches a detailed menu.",0,0
952,The Dawson,Gastropub,2,"""See and be seen"" should be the motto of this hip spot, where globe lights shine like beacons through the façade's towering windows. Inside, a wraparound bar attracts spirited guests like moths to a flame. A lengthy communal table and open kitchen with a chef's counter offer multiple opportunities for meeting, greeting, and eating. Cocktails like the Surfer Rosa, which balances tequila and mezcal with blood orange and chilies, loosen-up diners jonesing for big flavors. When hunger strikes, caramelized onion sabayon, potato confit, and garlicky pea shoots add depth to an Arctic char fillet. And lest you forget dessert, Bourbon-pecan bread pudding set upon flash-frozen vanilla cream and drizzled with sea salt-butterscotch sauce, is meant for sharing-or not.",0,0
953,The Lobby,Contemporary,3,"You can't say you weren't warned. The Peninsula people sensibly realized that honesty was best when naming this vast space which looks remarkably like...a lobby. At least the friendly staff manages to wrestle back some control, and you know your conversation won't be overheard-because there aren't any tables near you. So why the recommendation? Because the food is very good. The lunch menu doesn't really get past lobster rolls and chicken legs, but at night the kitchen's innate skill is very much in evidence. Dishes are good-looking, but also have depth and ingredients are of irreproachable quality. Flavors marry well and there are intriguing touches of originality but never at the expense of the overall balance of the dish.",0,0
954,Piccolo Sogno,Italian,2,"In-the-know locals craving mouthwatering Italian fare head to this swanky spot, usually packed with a dressy crowd. Inside, they are welcomed by a palette of rich, cool hues, crystal-beaded light fixtures that hang overhead, and an open kitchen boasting a wood-burning oven. Piccolo Sogno's rustic, yet refined menu offers traditional dishes with a twist. A version of the ubiquitous beet salad (both red and golden) is elevated here by shaved fennel, a drizzle of bright citrus oil, and a dollop of creamy, lush buffalo milk ricotta. If you need further encouragement, let us recommend the rabbit. Braised in a white wine sauce redolent of rosemary and lemon, the tender meat is served with wilted escarole and porridge-like semolina pudding.",0,0
955,Fulton Market Kitchen,Contemporary,3,"Floor-to-ceiling windows put Embeya's industrial interior on display, letting passersby soak up its intriguing sculptural elements and Asian-inspired decor. Inside, blown-glass bouquets of light fixtures hang above communal tables, and wooden screens in intricate cutout patterns divide the lofty, airy dining room and open kitchen, where Chef Mike Sheerin and his team whip up enticing Pan-Asian fare. The affordable lunch menu features dishes like carrot salad with shaved country ham, an assertively spicy togarashi dressing, and a swipe of yuzu curd; or udon in a thickened broth with diced tofu and seasonal vegetables. Dinner entrées display more ambition, as in poached halibut with coconut, hearts of palm, and mint fumet.",0,0
956,Gino's East,Pizza,2,"Pizza pilgrims continue to make the trek to the original location of this renowned local deep-dish chain, where a 45 minute wait is the norm. However, solo diners may rest assured as they can order personal pies from a walk-up counter. The walls, scribbled with years of graffiti, are nearly as iconic as the high-walled pies themselves, whose crusts get their signature crunch from cornmeal and searing-hot metal pans rife with two inch-high sides. Filled with heaps of mozzarella and toppings like the ""Meaty Legend"" lineup of spicy pepperoni, Italian sausage, and both Canadian and regular bacon before getting sauced, it's hard to eat more than two wedges here. Nonconformists can of course opt for thin-crust pies, gussied-up by add-ons like roasted red peppers.",0,0
957,RL,American,3,"If you swoon for tartan and pine for the posh life Ralph Lauren represents, head for the boîte attached to the flagship Michigan Avenue store. Like a stylish private club but without the centuries of stuffiness, RL offers options for a quick solo lunch, cocktail at the mahogany bar, or full dinner. The odd Blackhawks jersey here and there doesn't detract from the overall aura. The menu is as classically American as the name, featuring bistro favorites like Waldorf salad and raw bar offerings alongside well-prepared dishes like sweet and plump pan-seared scallops with white balsamic-crème fraîche. The thin, flaky crust of a goat cheese- and caramelized onion-tart nearly steals the show from the rich atmosphere of the wood-paneled dining room.",0,0
958,NoMI Kitchen,American,3,"A hushed aerie awaits on the seventh floor of the Park Hyatt at NoMI Kitchen. Let the dapper staff whisk you through the hotel lobby and elevator to a glassed-in dining room with Water Tower views. A semi-open kitchen doesn't detract from the lush but restrained décor, and a breezy terrace offers an alfresco option with a different menu. Chef Ryan LaRoche's impressive, ingredient-driven dishes are equally inspired by Eastern and Western cuisines. Fresh fish makes for a seaworthy selection of sushi and maki, while pickled pepper jam and sweet pine nut streusel pair with orbs of fried caponata-style eggplant that are crispy on the outside and perfectly silky within. End with a parade of house-made ice cream flavors like toasted vanilla marshmallow.",0,0
959,La Sirena Clandestina,Latin American,2,"A relaxing Caribbean vibe breezes its way northward to Fulton Market and settles within La Sirena Clandestina's aquamarine walls. Languidly spinning fans, light filtered through antique etched glass panels, and an international selection of sippable rum and mezcal all conspire to bring guests' blood pressure down a notch or two. Baked empanadas rotate through a series of fillings, but these popular pockets never leave the menu. Whether stuffed with venison ragù or ricotta, hazelnut, and butternut squash, they're all exceptional. Handfuls of Manchego add decadence to plump bomba rice studded with fiery pickled jalapeño rings, toasted pepitas, and buttery white corn. Classic alfajore shortbreads filled with dulce de leche and sea salt are a memorable send-off.",0,0
960,NEXT,Contemporary,4,"Welcome to dinner as theater, where the only thing more radical than each new theme is the success (or failure) of the cuisine. Next's conceit is reinvention. It may begin the year as, say, a culinary homage to French ""Bistro"" cooking with hit-or-miss fare that does little to underscore the kitchen's strengths. The long, dark, windowless room reflects that theme with a smattering of typical trappings, like chalkboard specials on the wall and little ceramic roosters on the table. Some concepts may be rooted in regional innovation, offering an array of Spanish ""Tapas."" Months later, the chefs may craft small plates with an eye on wine and global ""Terrior."" This is a very unique place with an adept and dexterous kitchen, but the experience just isn't for everyone.",0,0
961,Eleven City Diner,Deli,1,"Nosh on a mile-high sandwich or chocolate malt at Eleven City Diner, a modern revival of the classic Jewish deli. Gleaming subway tiles play off retro leather booths and swiveling barstools, while jazz in the background keeps things moving with chutzpah and finesse. Diner standards include patty melts, sandwiches piled with corned beef or pastrami, knishes, and latkes. Bubbie's chicken soup comes bobbing with a fluffy matzo ball the size of a baseball; while Junior's cheesecake from Brooklyn or a triple-decker wedge of red velvet cake sates all the sweet-loving guests. A full-service deli counter offers salamis and smoked fish to-go. For a true blast from the past, stop by the candy stand near the entry stocked with Bazooka Joe and other favorites.",0,0
962,Bistronomic,French,2,"Tucked away from the buzz of the Magnificent Mile, Bistronomic is a great place to cool your tired heels. Jaunty red awnings beckon brightly, and the revolving door spins guests into a warm room that's focused on the bonhomie of dining with friends. Oxblood walls, gray banquettes, and a central bar play up the bistro feel, while the kitchen conveys creativity with fresh renditions of tasty classics. Rusticity and elegance come together in a fillet of Lake Superior whitefish that is pan-seared to golden-brown and matched with spring ratatouille, preserved lemon, and puréed eggplant. Exquisitely crisp feuilletine is a glamorous upgrade to the classic Kit Kat bar, folded with hazelnuts, bittersweet chocolate, and finished with a sweet-tart orange sauce.",0,0
963,La Sardine,French,2,"In a neighborhood packed to the gills with gastronomic innovation, La Sardine may be the most daring option of all, flaunting hearty French bistro food in a warm and rustic setting. The time-tested combination of wheezing accordion music, white linens, tile floors, and pastoral murals makes it all the rage among diners craving the familiar-and a $30 lunch prix-fixe doesn't hurt either. From escargots and steak tartare to bouillabaisse and steak frites, Chef/owner Jean-Claude Poilevey nails the classic bistro dishes. Don't miss the steak haché, a patty of excellent ground beef seared to perfection, then topped with smoked goat cheese and plated with truffle-laced Bibb lettuce, a thick slice of maple bacon, and crunchy fried onion rings.",0,0
964,mk,American,3,"After nearly two decades in business, larger than life ""mk"" still welcomes all to Chef/owner Michael Kornick's eponymous flagship. Rich brown tones warm up the former paint factory's lofty interior, which features a skylit space that's beloved citywide for big nights and romantic evenings. There's a seasonal dish here to sate every appetite, whether diners are seated at linen-draped tables or perched on sleek stools in the lounge area. Bar bites offer upscale indulgences like bison sliders tucked into bone marrow-buttered focaccia, while a dual preparation of tartares-yellowfin tuna with Moroccan olives complementing Scottish salmon with charred red onion-could be a meal on its own. For dessert, citrusy ""Where troubles melt like lemon drops"" is every bit as charming as its name.",0,0
965,Pizano's,Pizza,1,"While Chicago may be hailed as home of the deep-dish pizza, the thin-crust pies at Pizano's have justly earned their own devoted following. This refreshing and cozy local spot recalls Italian-American style without feeling like a chain-restaurant cliché; even the waitstaff's genuine warmth is palpable. Of course, the crowds come for the crust-here it is flaky, buttery, thin (by local standards), and perfectly crisp. As unexpected as it sounds, their pizzas are some of the best in town. And yet, it should be no surprise as pizza has long been the family calling: owner Rudy Malnati's father founded Pizzeria Uno. The ""thinner"" offspring at Pizano's sates its growing fan-base from three locations, and even ships to those far from the Second City.",0,0
966,Vera,Spanish,2,"Pimentón de la Vera, one of the most powerful spices in Spanish cuisine, also provides partial inspiration for this first-come, first-served wine bar in the West Loop dining corridor. (The other homage? Chef/owner Mark Mendez's grandmother.) Exposed brick walls and walnut floors are typically lovely, but do little to soften the din of a happy hour crowd after a few glasses of sherry. Classic tapas as well as ham-and-cheese flights comprise the menu, along with larger plates like a piled-high paella with rabbit, duck, and chorizo. Shell out a few extra dollars for crusty bread to sop up the garlicky, lemony olive oil that bathes their plump head-on shrimp. Grilled rounds of octopus are sweet and smoky thanks to a liberal dose of good old pimentón.",0,0
967,Café des Architectes,Contemporary,3,"European sophistication lends extra polish to this shimmering contemporary spot in the Sofitel Hotel, where ""Bonjour"" is passed around freely by the mostly French staff. The dining room is just as chic, with crimson banquettes, black-and-white portraits of the city's architectural marvels, and floor-to-ceiling windows with striking steel accents. The seasonally shifting lineup of small plates is simple but creative, like a single Wianno oyster dabbed with fennel cream and crowned with spoonfuls of both sturgeon and faux citrus caviar. Market-inspired entrées include butternut squash ribbons curling over tender beef short rib and vanilla-tinged salsify purée. For a more casual, small bites affair, move to Le Bar, the hotel's chic watering hole.",0,0
968,deca,Contemporary,2,"Part of the Ritz-Carlton's expansive 12th floor lobby, deca is a casual haunt that still keeps a few high-end accents around. Paintings hung in gilded frames add to the attractiveness in the seated dining area; and a gently trickling sculptural fountain (illuminated by a skylight) offers an auditory escape from the lobby's background buzz. The well-edited menu features light, seasonal dishes that are skillfully prepared. Two large pillows of freshly made squash ravioli are garnished with hearty kale pistou, pickled wild mushrooms, and toasted pepitas. Wild salmon with a crunchy mustard crust is bathed in luxurious garlic-red wine jus. Finish in style with a wedge of tangy lemon tart decorated with fresh raspberries and set atop a neat pool of coulis.",0,0
969,Tête Charcuterie,French,2,"No greater respect can be shown to a former meatpacking warehouse than by converting it into a restaurant specialising in charcuterie. This most ancient of culinary arts is joyfully celebrated here in all its forms-there are cured meats, wonderful glistening terrines, rich pâtés, and plump homemade sausages. This is roll-your-sleeves-up food that will put hair on your chest. The enthusiasm of the on-view kitchen team is palpable. Curing is done in-house and there's a separate Sausage Room where they create their own varieties, which range from a French boudin blanc to Moroccan inspired merguez. But don't think they can't show a light touch when required: the ""spring garden"" served en cocotte is one of the prettiest things you'll see.",0,0
970,Pelago,Italian,3,"Adjacent to Hotel Raffaello, the elegance of this brick structure is accentuated by large arched windows. Inside, the bi-level room wears a crisp style à la high ceilings, eminently comfortable leather seats, and a soft azure-blue color scheme. If the décor doesn't transport you to the Mediterranean in a flash, look to the regional Italian menu with ingredients imported directly. A salad of plum tomatoes topped with creamy burrata and fragrant basil in a light dressing is as inherently satisfying. So, too, are pasta signatures including rich risotto alle verdure or creamy ricotta-filled ravioli swimming in a vibrant sauce of spinach and showered with slivers of nutty parmesan. Swap dessert for a fine selection of imported cheeses, and never look back.",0,0
971,Vora,Asian,2,"Whether you're a carnivore, herbivore, or somewhere in between, Vora's plethora of Asian offerings aims to please. The modern space puts nature at the forefront with vine-like clusters of light bulbs snaking above bars, room dividers punctuated with floral cutouts, and sprightly lime-green banquettes. Can't choose from the health-oriented lineup of Taiwanese dim sum, Indian curries, or Chinese classics? The dim sum box is actually a bento offering a dizzying array of multi-cultural tastes: soft shrimp siu mai, juicy xiao long bao, steamed pork buns, and miso soup, as well as other bites. Slices of Sichuan beef and vegetables stir-fried with chili sauce can be amped up to match Chinatown's level of heat, or toned down to suit milder tastes.",0,0
972,Spiaggia,Italian,4,"This modern bi-level dining room showcases subdued shades of gray, an intricately tiled marble floor, and spacious seating that only money can buy. Its views of the lake and Magnificent Mile are just as priceless. Glass ""caves"" for wine and cheese, and charcuterie served at the bar whet the appetite. The kitchen reflects its elegant surrounds in treating each meticulously sourced ingredient with care, respect, and talent. Modern twists are clear throughout the menu, yet Spiaggia remains a very classic Italian restaurant. This is immediately evident in pasta courses such as the springy and resilient fresh tajarin; the thin and pale yellow noodles are twirled with a none-too-buttery sauce and generous shaving of fragrant white truffles. ""Little hats"" or cappelletti are stuffed with duck confit, leeks, and Parmigiano, then served in a rich duck consommé amid poached egg and dehydrated hen of the woods mushrooms. Venison with white truffles, chestnut purée, and tart macerated mulberries is amazingly delicate on all levels. Finish with puffs of blood orange meringue with pine-rosemary essence and pine-nut brittle. Ignore the occasional trip-ups and upsells; dining here is a true culinary journey.",1,1
973,Cafe Spiaggia,Italian,2,"After an extensive renovation, Cafe Spiaggia is sporting a sophisticated, contemporary new look, with beautiful white tufted leather banquettes, dark wood tables, and black-and-white photos gracing the wall. Towards the back, leather stools line a long white marble bar, and majestic floor-to-ceiling windows offer views of Magnificent Mile. The menu is solid and approachable Italian-a decidedly less formal alternative to sophisticated older sister, Spiaggia, next door. Kick things off with the piadini, a thin Romagna-style flatbread, grilled and folded around delicious fillings like mortadella, maybe a caprese, or even chicken and honey. Then, slide on over to the kitchen's focus-gemelli humming with summer beans, preserved lemon, Pecorino Romano, and Prosciutto di Parma.",0,0
974,Nico Osteria,Italian,3,"Buzz around Nico Osteria has already reached deafening levels, especially since this Paul Kahan spot isn't tucked into a gentrifying corner of the city, but situated smack dab in the center of the chic Gold Coast. Communal bar seating keeps the space humming with energy, but moody lighting conspires to keep the vibe relaxed. Though billed as Italian-inspired cooking, the kitchen takes liberties with traditional dishes on the seafood-heavy menu. Well-grilled and generously oiled sourdough fett'unta topped with combinations like baccalà and Dungeness crab are rustic introductions to the meal. Ask for more bread to soak up the Neapolitan-style ragù-a skillet bubbling with goodies like a swordfish meatball and slabs of grilled pork belly in a tomato gravy.",0,0
975,Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House,American,2,"Housed in a sprawling setting adjacent to big brother Gibson's, Hugo's always seems packed. The vast dining room sets white linen-topped tables amidst dark polished wood and pale walls decorated with a mounted swordfish, fish prints, and model ships. Hugo's bar draws its own crowds with abundant counter seating. The menu focuses on a selection of fish preparations as well as steaks and chops. These are supplemented by stone crab claws, oysters, crab cakes, chowders, and sautéed frog's legs. Speaking of frog's legs, the restaurant takes its name from the nickname of owner Hugo Ralli's grandfather, General Bruce Hay of Her Majesty's Imperial Forces. Bring a football team to share a slice of the Muddy Bottom Pie, a decadent (and enormous) ice cream cake.",0,0
976,Merlo on Maple,Italian,3,"Inside a graciously decorated Victorian townhouse, Chef/owner Luisa Silvia Marani proudly showcases the bounty of her native Bologna with an Emiliana-inflected accent and delicious Northern Italian fare. Her frequently changing roster of luscious dishes are edible billboards for the foods of the region-think mortadella di Bologna and tartufi neri del'Umbria. Rabbit ragù clings to delicate parsley-flecked bow tie pasta tossed with Parmigiano-Reggiano and copious handfuls of butter. Wine-braised bone-in lamb shank, served in its own rich sauce, needs little else to shine. Signature budino di mascarpone, cioccolato e caffé is the standard-bearer for proper tiramisù, accompanied by tart sugar-coated red currants to offset the creamy sweetness.",0,0
977,TWO,American,2,"This urban interpretation of a Midwest tavern was set up by two owners, features two chefs, second-hand furnishings, and an address whose last digit is-you guessed it-the number two. Step past the vintage Toledo scales to arrive at this reclaimed wood-paneled space dressed with antique meat cleavers, quaint ceiling fans, and large barn doors. If that doesn't scream farm-to-fork cuisine, consider what's being whipped up in the open kitchen (the banquette across from it affords the best view): a ramp raviolo filled with ricotta, a perfectly cooked hen's egg, and enhanced by brown butter and shiitakes; or a halibut fillet with cherry tomatoes and asparagus. On the sweet front, homemade puppy chow is chilled, crisp, and delicious with a uniform sugar dusting.",0,0
978,Tuscany on Taylor,Italian,2,"Italian and Chicago accents co-mingle at Tuscany on Taylor, where the classic cuisine and service are perfectly old-school (no pun intended-the university is a few blocks away). The formal staff tends to diners at white linen-topped tables in the terra cotta-tiled dining room. Chefs in puffy toques man the open kitchen amid shelves of polished copper pans. A wide-ranging menu of modern Italian interpretations takes guests on a whirlwind tour of the boot. Tiny ravioli stuffed with roasted pears are set in a densely flavorful mascarpone cream sauce with toasted pine nuts and strips of sundried tomatoes. A simple caprese salad arrives as three stacks of thickly sliced heirloom tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, and basil pesto drizzled with balsamic reduction.",0,0
979,Bistrot Zinc,French,2,"If you couldn't tell from the bright red exterior and hand-painted windows, Bistrot Zinc is indeed a classic dressed in mosaic-tiled floors, lemon-tinted walls hung with mirrors, woven rattan chairs, and yes, that curvaceous zinc bar. Suits, locals, and Gold Coast power shoppers populate the tables from lunch through dinner, as white-aproned waiters happily uncork bottles of rouge et blanc. Don't look for modern surprises on the menu; contentment here is attained through uncomplicated but expertly prepared French dishes from frites to frisée. Whole trout, pan-fried until golden and napped with butter sauce, hits all the right notes; while daily standards like croque monsieur or French onion soup are enhanced by more ambitious monthly specials.",0,0
980,Kurah,Middle Eastern,2,"The phrase ""small plates"" doesn't always translate to ""great value,"" but Kurah offers an exception to the rule with its affordable selection of shareable, Middle Eastern-influenced dishes. Featuring Arabic-inspired wallpaper and upholstered seats, the setting is as warm and cozy as the open grill blazing away in the kitchen. Build a meal from hot and cold tapas options like muthowma, a blend of silky potatoes and whipped garlic that's perfect for scooping onto warm pita bread. Larger meat platters like a single juicy lamb and beef kifta kabob, served with roasted vegetables and golden saffron rice, make a hearty meal for one. For dessert, dark chocolate oozes invitingly between layers of phyllo and crushed walnuts in a tasty twist on classic baklava.",0,0
981,Table Fifty-Two,Southern,3,"Chef Art Smith's drawl floats overhead like a warm breeze as he chats up guests inside Table Fifty-Two's cozy white row house, a stately survivor of the Great Chicago Fire. Southern charm permeates every inch of the room, from the pressed-copper ceiling to the white sideboards to a wood-burning oven churning out the restaurant's signature biscuits. The meal might get started with an amuse-bouche of deviled eggs topped with pickled mustard seeds, and if it's a Sunday or Monday, the famous fried chicken will be making an appearance on many plates. Plump fried green tomatoes and thick pork chops are on order, but for a true down-home taste, get a tall wedge of hummingbird cake, fragrant with banana and pineapple and slathered in cream cheese frosting.",0,0
982,Chicago q,Barbecue,2,"American barbecue is anything but honky tonk in this gorgeous Gold Coast setting. Everything within the bright, bi-level space seems to gleam, from the colossal contemporary light fixtures and sun-splashed skylights to the shimmering open kitchen and myriad bottles of whiskey at the bar. Elegant preparations elevate traditional barbecue elements, like a spicy pairing of cornmeal-dredged fried green tomatoes and habañero-glazed pork belly with red onion-mango relish. Baby back ribs-so tender they're practically falling off the bone-are served with a trio of house-made sauces for dipping and slathering. And pig lovers planning for a large party can order a whole pork shoulder carved tableside with a picnic-worthy spread of slaw, beans, and cornbread.",0,0
983,Riva,Seafood,2,"If a stroll along Navy Pier works up an appetite, follow your nose (and stomach) past the Ferris wheel to Riva, a nautically themed escape from the carnival atmosphere. The upstairs dining room is a visual feast, with colorful murals above the open kitchen and sweeping lakeshore views; while a casual café downstairs serves drinks and light bites. Though the menu swims with seafood, Prime steaks and Italian-inspired dishes like pear-and-cheese agnolotti offer variety. Caper-studded Louis sauce augments a single plump cake of jumbo lump crab with a crisp side of Asian slaw. A fillet of Atlantic salmon is placed atop a vibrant plate and paired with cherry tomato fondue, a handful of quartered Brussels sprouts, and bite-sized potato gnocchetti.",0,0
984,Coalfire Pizza,Pizza,1,"Sure, you could come for a salad, but the focus here is on pizza-and yours should be, too. The cozy room features an open kitchen where pie production is on display for all to see. And in a playful bit of recycling, empty tomato sauce cans on each table become stands for sizzling pizzas churned straight from the 800-degree F coal oven. This hot spot has its ratio down to a fine art and knows not to burden its thin, crispy crust that's blackened and blistered in all the right places. The mortadella is a delight, with chopped garlic and gossamer slices of peppercorn-flecked sausage. Care to go your own way? Build the perfect pie with toppings that run the gamut from Gorgonzola to goat cheese. A second location in Lakeview continues to thrive.",0,0
985,Chez Joël,French,2,"With tables covered in archetypal butcher's paper, butter-yellow walls, and red velvet window dressings, Chez Joël adds a touch of je ne sais quoi to Little Italy. The cozy, romantic setting is filled with expats and locals reliving memories of their trips to the City of Light. Taxidermied pheasants keep watch over the room from their high perches, like a Deyrolle curiosity. The kitchen gives classic French cuisine a soupçon of international embellishment. Three plump scallops spooned with basil pesto are set over a pool of tomato coulis for a Franco-Italian take on coquilles St. Jacques. A simple Caesar salad benefits from fresh ingredients like tender grilled chicken and crisp romaine lettuce in a garlicky dressing. Tasty pastas round out the menu.",0,0
986,bellyQ,Asian,2,"This end of West Randolph Street might be quiet, but it's always a party inside bellyQ. The volume and energy are high throughout the lofty, concrete-heavy space with tabletop hibachi booths and industrial metal seating. A wall-length horse-themed screen separates the restaurant from casual sister spot Urban Belly, which shares the open kitchen. As imagined by prolific Chef/owner Bill Kim, the Asian barbecue experience at BellyQ takes its form in a number of genre-melding shareable plates. A side of bibimbap-style sticky rice is crunchy and tender, tossed with glistening slices of Chinese sausage and generously sprinkled with togarashi. Chewy chunks of brownie in vanilla soft-serve are drizzled with caramel-balsamic-soy ""Seoul sauce"" for a savory twist.",0,0
987,Pump Room,American,2,"Back when the Public Hotel was known as the Ambassador East, scores of celebrities clinked glasses and forks in the Pump Room. Though these memories are preserved in black-and-white photos hung throughout the hotel, today the sunken dining room is a classy, updated space where cushy circular booths, mod orbital lights, and brown kraft paper placemats meld flawlessly. Under the direction of Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the seasonal American menu is as casually riveting as the décor. An amply sized boneless fried chicken breast is moist and flavorful beneath its shatteringly crisp coating, ready to sop up habanero-infused butter sauce. In an elegant sundae, handfuls of candied peanuts and caramel popcorn top three neat quenelles of salted caramel ice cream.",0,0
988,Charlatan,Mediterranean,2,"Despite what its moniker might suggest, Charlatan is in fact a genuine and authentic show of talent. Hip and comfortable, this gastropub boasts whimsical toile and velvet details, a trio of mounted animal heads, and quality fare that puts the average pub grub to shame. The menu is anchored by a number of inventive pastas prepared in-house, like charred fennel-stuffed tortellini bobbing in a boldly seasoned porchetta brodo hit with fennel pollen and garlic-mustard oil. Unbelievably tender grilled octopus is plated with beef-braised carrots and fried bone marrow-enriched romesco; and the honeycomb-topped chocolate tart tastes as silky as a bowl of pudding. To make the most of your meal, wash it all down with a local brew or wine from a small producer.",0,0
989,Acadia,Contemporary,3,"Dining here is like being let in on a secret, uncovered along this rather unfortunate strip of no-man's land. The unexpected yet grand space employs nothing but neutral grays that extend from the concrete façade to the cushioned chairs and silvery beads dividing the center of this lofty room in half. Service is gracious and professional-the kind we should all expect but is hard to find. Unusual and artful presentations may begin with canapés arriving in a box of moss or along a branch. Follow this with hamachi served as a brilliant study of flavor and balance, showcasing silky and beautifully marbled fish, placed on a bed of coconut-infused rice pudding with dabs of black garlic, bits of finger lime, and lemongrass-spiced chutney. Genius and luxury are at play in the sinfully rich Australian Wagyu beef, served red and fleshy with classic Bordelaise, roasted maitake to magnify the umami, chunks of sweet lobster, and lobster foam to lend an ocean-like airiness to the plate. Finish meals on a smooth and fudgy note with chocolate pudding cake accompanied by coconut gelée for striking visual contrast, a swipe of caramel, rum ice cream, candied black walnut, and toasty little slivers of fresh coconut.",2,1
990,Old Jerusalem,Middle Eastern,1,"Set on a charming and centrally located stretch of Old Town, this family-run Middle Eastern favorite has been eagerly accommodating its happy customers for years. The menu focuses on Lebanese classics, such as tabbouleh with cracked wheat, scallions, and tomatoes, seasoned with lemon, olive oil, and plenty of crisp, green parsley. Hummus arrives rich with tahini, perhaps accompanying the likes of grilled chicken kebabs and traditional flatbreads. Finish with flaky-sweet baklava. While the décor may not impress, Old Jerusalem manages to make its well-worn look feel cozy and comfortable for everyone. Very reasonable prices, family-friendly service, and generous portions make this the neighborhood go-to, whether dining in or taking out.",0,0
991,Three Aces,Gastropub,2,"Look past the fact that Three Aces is a bar-a hip, dimly-lit, rock n' roll-loving bar at that-and you'll find a soulful kitchen with a deft hand at turning out Italian riffs on American farm-to-table cuisine. Inventive combinations are the order of the day on both the food and cocktail lists; the Fiery Jalesco gets motors revving with a delicately smoky blend of mezcal, St. Germain, and grapefruit aromatics. Many dishes beg for sharing, like the Calabrese pizzetta that heats things up with spicy sausage and red chili flakes. Roast beef panini takes its cue from Chicago's famous Italian beef, its pressed sourdough slices are slathered with aïoli, packed to the gills with tangy giardiniera and provolone, and served with garlicky beef jus.",0,0
992,County,Barbecue,1,"As its name implies, this urban 'cue joint celebrates barbecue in all its lip-smacking regional varieties. A flannel-lined wall stretches behind wooden tables set with an array of sauces for sampling, and beer and Bourbon take precedence on the drinks menu. Ensuring that no barbecue briquette goes unturned, the menu's spice rubs, brines, and smoking methods honor the regional styles of the Carolinas, west Texas, Kansas City, and Memphis. Take a gander at the nightly ""smokin' specials"" or choose from an already impressive lineup of slow-smoked ribs, wings, and other tasty bits. For extra impact, add a pile of tender pulled pork to a smoked bacon and fried green tomato sandwich-and order a slice of sensationally sweet pecan pie from Scafuri Bakery for dessert.",0,0
993,Stax Café,American,1,"""We're Breakfast Geeks. We take this stuff way too seriously"" reads one of the server's T-shirts at Stax Café, and UIC students and staff are grateful for their dedication to heart-warming wake-up delights. From the coffee and fresh juice bar for on-the-go types, to flat-screen TVs for those dying to catch up on sports, this corner restaurant aims to get everyone's day started right. Breakfast items with tasty twists abound, like ricotta pancakes with strawberry-rhubarb compote; or the Spanish Harlem omelet served frittata-style with chorizo, roasted tomatoes, and poblano peppers. Can't choose? Get a side of mini waffles dusted with powdered sugar alongside your main dish, and don't forget to check out the chalkboards for specials-perhaps breakfast tacos?",0,0
994,DeCOLORES,Mexican,2,"This family-owned Mexican restaurant in Pilsen's art district appropriately doubles as a gallery, with locals' works rotating frequently on the coffee-colored walls. If the pieces for sale don't strike a chord, just admire the bar's halting design of stylized metal branches snaking between shelves of colorful sugar skulls and paper flags. Recipes passed down through generations highlight fresh vegetables and healthy fare. The salsa with house-made corn chips as a starter changes every day, but each variety is a pleasure. Hominy stew with roast pork is traditionally garnished with shaved raw cabbage, radish, and red onion in pozole and then sprinkled with cucumber salsa for a fresh take; while boneless guajillo-marinated pork loin chops gain sweetness from grilled pineapple.",0,0
995,Bascule Wine Bar,Contemporary,2,"Among the profusion of Italian-American standbys in Little Italy, Bascule emerges as a rustic and welcoming newcomer. Wide wood plank floors and a windowed façade open up the cozy space, flooding the length of the bar with light-and a semi-open kitchen turning out ambitious seasonal dishes emphasizes that this is much more than a wine bar. Quality ingredients and technique are on display in compositions like Indiana-farmed rabbit loin tucked with black pepper and glazed with blueberry and rhubarb demi-glace to balance sweetness and spice. Half portions let guests enjoy tastes of heady dishes like truffle cavatappi with cheddar crackling and roasted crumpled parsley. Stuffed? Order a slice of the olive oil cake for an ethereally light finale.",0,0
996,Flo,Southwestern,1,"It's not Santa Fe, but the Southwest is well represented in West Town through the chili-packed flavors at Flo. This early meals joint cranks out a variety of spicy and tasty Tex-Mex dishes for diners crowded into the sunlight-dappled dining room. Pressed-tin ceilings, mirrors mounted on exposed brick, and narrow plank floors add quaint appeal. Made-to-order breakfast and brunch is served until 2:30 P.M., allowing ample time for Fruity Pebbles French toast or breakfast burritos. Pollo picante quesadillas get a kick from pickled jalapeños and Jack cheese. Sopapillas come in sweet as well as savory varieties like house-made chorizo with scrambled eggs and cheddar. As in the Southwest, fresh red or green chili is always offered as an option.",0,0
997,Green Zebra,Vegetarian,2,"Named after a popular heirloom tomato variety, Chef/owner Shawn McClain's vegetarian standby is beloved among Chicagoans looking for an upscale meat-free experience. Japanese minimalism inspires the small space's décor, with palms and bamboo lining the entry and earthy tones throughout the room. Diners graze on shared small plates paired with organic and biodynamic wines. Creamy hen of the woods mushroom pâté, served with caramelized Vidalia onion marmalade and toasted bread, ensures that no one misses the meat. Peppery arugula purée and a dollop of crème fraîche balance silky celery root soup. Thin shards of dark chocolate and dense peanut mousse with currant coulis are a match made in vegan heaven; a crushed pretzel garnish gilds the lily.",0,0
998,The Rosebud,Italian,2,"The Rosebud holds its own among the brass of University Village's Italian thoroughfare. The original location of what is now an extended family of restaurants throughout Chicagoland, it's nothing if not classic with its red neon sign, dark carved wood, and cool but accommodating all-male waitstaff. Italian wedding soup brings comfort with moist, tiny meatballs, escarole, and acini di pepe simmered in broth; while sweet sausage chunks, caramelized onions, and a garlicky white wine sauce make chicken giambotta a satisfying choice. Loyal clientele crowd around white tablecloths for platters of their favorite chicken parmesan or linguine topped with a mountain of clams. Also, dessert is not to be missed: a single slice of carrot cake will gratify the whole table.",0,0
999,Mexique,Mexican,2,"Large groups fill most of the banquettes in this slender space, but a bar stretching half the length of the room makes it easy for smaller parties to stop in for a glass of sangria. A large rear window offers a glimpse of Chef Carlos Gaytan at work in the kitchen, and congratulatory graffiti from visiting chefs provides a fun distraction on the way to the restroom. Many of Mexique's contemporary Mexican dishes are inspired by classical French techniques. From the platos fuertes, the mar y tierra is a delightful composition of Michoacán-style braised pork belly over silken sweet potato purée dressed with a complex dark mole prepared from over 20 ingredients; sea scallop with bacon-apple jam and pickled onions complete this intoxicating one plate feast.",0,0
1000,Cai,Chinese,1,"Cai rolls out the red carpet for a lavish experience on the second floor of Chinatown Square, making it the local choice for celebratory seafood dinners or quick midday dim sum. The banquet hall-style room is grand and formal, complete with crystal chandeliers and professional service. To say there's a lot to choose from is an understatement, as there are nearly 100 rolled, crimped, steamed, and fried dim sum options alone. Highlights include flaky puff pastry turnovers filled with sweet and savory barbecue pork; and large lotus leaves that envelope tender sticky rice mixed with chicken, liver, and crab. When the dim sum parade ends at 4:00P.M., the menu shifts to an equally vast selection of Cantonese dishes like crunchy stir-fried lotus root with ginger.",0,0
1001,Frontier,American,2,"If Davy Crockett is king of the wild frontier, then chances are he'd be smitten by this stylish, modern-day saloon. To start, a taxidermied grizzly bear, wolf, and bison head hang among football-flaunting flat-screens behind the 40 foot-long bar. And even Frontier's menu drives home the hunt-and-gather theme, with dishes divided into three sections: ""Fried,"" ""Foraged,"" and ""Whole Animal Service."" Carnivores revel in the chef's signature duck tacos juiced with salsa verde, while pescetarians beg for crab Benedict-a superb staple of toasted muffins with sweet crabmeat, soft poached eggs, and spicy Hollandaise. Calorie-counters love the well-dressed house salad, but for dessert, there is no passing up on crispy sugar doughnuts-gently caressed with a rum-apple sauce in true Crockett fashion.",0,0
1002,Ruxbin,American,2,"Refurbished and repurposed is the rationale behind Ruxbin's funky décor. In the tiny first-floor space, salvaged apple juice crates form wall panels and seat belts become chair backs. Up a few stairs, a stainless steel communal table offers a view into the semi-open kitchen. Meals usually start with popcorn seasoned with changing flavors like sesame and seaweed-a preview of the menu's mix of American and international ingredients. A fresh oyster trio gets three distinct garnishes: sambal-pickled ginger, tangy apple mignonette, and pork belly with a smoked aroma revealed by lifting a glass cloche. Seared scallops and pork carnitas meld with black raisin emulsion. Rest easy that you won't miss the booze here after trying a house-made basil-hibiscus soda.",0,0
1003,Phoenix,Chinese,1,"Dim sum lovers get the best of both worlds at Phoenix, a comfortable room that boasts a grand view of the Chicago skyline. Here, stacks of bamboo baskets are wheeled to tables on signature silver trolleys for a classic dim sum experience-yet each diner's selection is cooked to order for truly fresh and steaming hot bites. The proof is in the soft and poppable shrimp-and-chive dumplings and the fluffy white buns stuffed with chunks of barbecue pork. Those looking for larger portions will appreciate the meandering menu, which also boasts Hong Kong-style stir-fry and clay pot dishes alongside Americanized Chinese classics. Fillets of steamed sea bass swim in soy oil on a large oval platter, sprinkled with a touch of slivered scallion to brighten the delicately flaky fish.",0,0
1004,Twin Anchors,Barbecue,2,"Within the brick walls that have housed Twin Anchors since 1932, generations have made their way across the checkerboard linoleum floor to throw a quarter in the jukebox and get saucy with a slab of their legendary ribs in one of the curved booths. Though the bar is wall-to-wall on weekends, most weekdays are low-key, with families and groups ready for a casual night out. Fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs are the real deal, made with a sweet and spicy rub, served with their own ""zesty"" sauce or the newer Prohibition version, with brown sugar and a hint of ghost-pepper heat. Classic sides like onion rings, baked beans, or hearty chili round out the meal. If there's a wait at this no-reservations spot, try the beer of the month while cooling your heels.",0,0
1005,Lao Sze Chuan,Chinese,1,"The news clips papering its front windows don't lie: this flagship branch of Tony Hu's mini-chain is a longtime Chinatown hot spot with a second outpost in Streeterville. But hot is a double entendre here, and a crimson-themed décor along with mod acrylic chairs printed with chili peppers clues guests in to the kitchen's propensity for spicing things up. If the book-length menu seems overwhelming, scan the list of favorites at the beginning for a quick pick-be sure to avoid any items marked with a chili if you'd rather walk on the mild side. As for the hits, chili oil and peppercorns give numbing heat to crunchy, translucent sheets of beef tendon, and succulent Xinjiang-style cumin lamb is generously coated in cumin seeds and tossed with fresh, zippy ginger.",0,0
1006,MingHin,Chinese,1,"Conveniently situated on the ground level of Chinatown Square, MingHin is a stylish standby that draws a diverse crowd to the neighborhood. Spacious dining rooms separated by wooden lattice panels offer seating for a number of occasions, from casual booths and large banquet-style rounds to specially outfitted tables for hot pots. Dim sum is a popular choice even on weekdays, with diners making selections from photographic menus rather than waiting for a passing cart. Among the numerous options, juicy har gao, stuffed with plump seasoned shrimp, always hit the spot. Pan-fried turnip cakes are simultaneously crispy and creamy, studded with bits of pork and mushroom, and fluffy, subtly sweet Malay steamed egg cake is a rare find for dessert.",0,0
1007,Ahjoomah's Apron,Korean,1,"Thanks to this modern, casual space, southside Chicagoans no longer need to head uptown for their fix of authentic Korean food. While there are no tabletop grills smoking up the dining room, the picnic-style tables fill quickly with generous portions of kitchen-grilled bulgogi, warming stews, and banchan. A crimson kimchi jjigae broth, seamlessly balanced between sour and spicy, bobs with soft chunks of tofu and pork. Bibimbap sizzles in a stone bowl, letting the requisite crispy crust form on the bottom while diners dig into a mountain of glistening sweet soy kalbi, crunchy vegetables, and fried egg. Want to feel virtuous about your meal? Wall posters tout the health benefits of traditional Korean ingredients like doenjang, an umami-rich soybean paste.",0,0
1008,Honky Tonk BBQ,Barbecue,2,"A rousing success since it opened in 2007, Honky Tonk BBQ serves up live music and award-winning Memphis-style treats on the southwest side of the city. Though the rollicking bar up front takes its cues from a swinging Wild West saloon, the rear dining room offers a more sedate-though still eclectic-setting for sipping house cocktails and chowing down on sensational smoked meats. You'll need two hands to hold homemade empanadas stuffed with combinations like Manchego cheese and shiitake mushrooms, and extra cottony white bread to soak up the juices of bone-in, wood-smoked chicken. Brisket chili is even more robust with a scoop of creamy mac and cheese-and if you're still hungry, soda floats with Bridgeport-made Filbert's root beer are the cherry on top.",0,0
1009,Balena,Italian,2,"Balena effortlessly blends rusticity and contemporary design in its prime Lincoln Park location. Lofty ceilings and industrial accents are a simple but statement-worthy juxtaposition against wooden floors and tables-and an appealingly inviting backdrop for a menu of inventive but solid takes on Italian cuisine. Knowledgeable, on-point service makes the meal even more divine. Start with a choice from the large vermouth selection and a round of burrata with pickled mustard seeds and fresh mint, ready to be piled on lardo-brushed toast. Or sink your teeth into wood-fired pizza with a parade of toppings like pistachio pesto and crisp mortadella. For dessert, brandy-soaked cherries add boozy warmth to caramel budino with salty-sweet praline crumble.",0,0
1010,Dusek's (Board & Beer),Gastropub,2,"Dusek's brings the party to Pilsen thanks to its palpable energy, groovy beats, and good-looking bar pouring an exceptional beverage program. Then consider the fact that the owners of Longman & Eagle are behind this operation and know that you're in for some seriously unique and outstanding eats. Housed in a booming, hipster-centric corner of the lower west side, this stylish public hall has major cool factor and enough real estate to be a triple threat. Framed by windows, the dining room is on the main floor while the upstairs (Thalia Hall) is a live music venue. Service throughout is very cordial, so settle in and await a spread of quirky American food. The menu changes daily so don't get hung up on favorites. However, smash-hits may include a wood-roasted cheese-stuffed pretzel coupled with wasabi dipping sauce as well as an ultra-decadent blue crab dip paired with artichoke relish and crusty, house-made pain d'epi. Live out your gourmet gastropub fantasy with slow-cooked salmon sporting a salty crust and spiced with salsa verde; or gnocchi tossed with lamb Bolognese and creamy ricotta. Portions should necessitate a doggie bag, but all the better to save room for an inventive fruit loop donut or even roasted chili churros with dulce de leche.",1,1
1011,Yuzu,Japanese,1,"Ancient and modern accents work in harmony at Yuzu, where hand-painted anime murals catch the eye above weathered plank wainscoting. A century-old wooden slab finds new life as a sushi counter, where diners sip sodas from Ball jars and groove to hip tunes. Whole ginger- and garlic-glazed grilled squid is sliced into rings, then sprinkled with scallions and creamy jalapeño sauce. Succulent robata-grilled skewers, purchased by the piece, arrive with specialized accompaniments like marinated pork shoulder with sweet chili sauce or kalbi-glazed short rib. The tobiko-topped Black Sea roll is one of a roster of quirky but manageably sized maki, all of which arrive with an artistic flourish-think intricate, paisley-patterned sauces painted onto plates.",0,0
1012,Perennial Virant,American,2,"Housed along tony Lincoln Avenue and packed with patrons to match, this Paul Virant operation is a ""perennial"" hit. Take the time to truly appreciate the philosophy followed at his haute farm-to-table spot, where local, sustainable cuisine combines with a minimalist décor featuring lush earth tones and chandeliers crafted from repurposed jars. Each ingredient-driven dish honors farmers and seasonality. Crisp pan-fried spaetzle, vivid green with mint, steals the show from a duo of mild but meaty lamb sausages, while a pickled pair of golden beets and diced onion provide a light, refreshing counterpoint to Arctic char. Chèvre ice cream rounds out an arrangement of velvety chocolate pavé, buttery graham cracker, salty-sweet caramel, and chewy coconut macarons.",0,0
1013,Alinea,Contemporary,4,"Who needs a meal followed by a show when you can have both together? That's because eating at Alinea, which involves around 20 courses over about three hours, is more than simply dinner-it's culinary theater. Perhaps it could qualify for a Tony Award along with its Michelin stars, because you're even invited backstage afterwards to meet the talented protagonists in the kitchen. Alinea provides such a vivid, visceral experience, that you'll even forget about the somewhat painful and entirely inhospitable booking procedure. Neophytes have nothing to fear here as there's a veritable army of charming, clued-up helpers and servers to guide you effortlessly through each and every dish. And guidance is certainly needed because the only menu you'll see is the one presented to you like an award certificate as you leave. The cooking is strikingly original and very clever. It can surprise but it can also challenge; at times dishes can be playful or even whimsical. But underpinning all those clever techniques and all those dazzling arrangements and quite striking presentations is an inherent understanding of flavor-and this is what gives the cooking such great depth.",3,1
1014,Boka,Contemporary,3,"Housed in an affluent part of town, find a small walkway that leads into this elaborate, handsome, and very sultry dining room. There are three different seating areas and each exudes class with a bit of romance, whimsy, and occasional quirk (note the escutcheon-covered doorway and capricious paintings). Against dark pebbled walls, find oversized horseshoe booths, long banquettes, and mirrored light bulbs casting funky shadows. The semi-outdoor solarium has a living wall of moss and ferns. Servers are friendly and genuine without a hint of pretense. This is the kind of place where one can sink in and not care to leave. Chef Lee Wolen's menu may be modern, but it is widely appealing with a Mediterranean edge. Begin with translucent slivers of fresh sea bass that get a pleasant chew from almond crumble and perfect flavor from a subtle dab of citrusy yuzu kosho. Then, deliciously tender and evenly pink Colorado lamb is served with a harmonious hodgepodge of creamy yogurt, charred lettuce, and nearly sweet baby potatoes. For dessert, an airy and whipped mound of praline-flavored mousse is set beside milk ice cream, which serves as a cooling counterpoint to the nutty flavors throughout and makes for a fine ending.",1,1
1015,Arami,Japanese,2,"Come to this bamboo-clad izakaya, with its comfortable sushi bar and soaring skylights, for impressively rendered small plates and specialty cocktails featuring Japanese spirits. The night's tsukemono can reveal spicy okra, crisp hearts of palm, and sweet burdock root, and the nigiri selection has showcased New Zealand King salmon topped with pickled wasabi root. The robata produces grilled maitakes with Japanese sea salt and black garlic purée; and gani korroke, a crunchy-creamy crab croquette, is plated with togarashi-spiked mayonnaise. Don't turn down the all-ice cream dessert menu, which includes enticing flavors like coconut-cinnamon-banana. It comes nestled in granola-like bits of miso-graham cracker crumble for a finish as sweet as it is unique.",0,0
1016,The Blanchard,French,3,"In a minimalist but elegant space that complements its picturesque Lincoln Park environs, The Blanchard serves up sophistication with a side of well-executed French bistro food. Petite portions still satiate thanks to the richness of classic dishes like rillettes, duck à l'orange, and foie gras preparations. Escargots à la Bourguignonne start the meal on a luxurious note, with each of six plump curls sitting on a knob of mushroom duxelles and bathed in garlic butter, parsley, and breadcrumbs. Lightly caramelized capers and a brown butter sauce garnish two thin fillets of Dover sole meunière, with a streak of green pea tendril pommes purée alongside. Lush passion fruit curd and a sprinkle of lavender buds enhance a moist and chewy coconut financier.",0,0
1017,Connie's Pizza,Pizza,2,"No one knows who Connie was, but the name happened to be on the building bought by Jim Stolfe in 1963, and it stuck. Even Chicagoans who've never set foot in this spacious location know about its near-monopoly at White Sox games (including a complimentary shuttle to U.S. Cellular Field) and constant presence at citywide festivals. Those who do step inside the flagship come for the convivial vibe and, of course, pizza. Of the many options, the deep-dish is Miss Popularity, but it's fun to go one further with a stuffed pizza topped with a buttery crust. The garlic- and oregano-laced sauce is pleasantly tangy, and carnivores sing the praises of Connie's plump fennel sausage. Call ahead to forego the 45-minute cooking time and pick your pie up at the drive-thru.",0,0
1018,tocco,Italian,2,"Are we in Milan or Wicker Park? Tocco brings haute design and fashion to the table with such upscale textural touches as polished resin, faux ostrich skin, and bubblegum-pink accents in this sleek black-and-white space. Don your catwalk best before visiting: a fashion-centric display near a long communal table hints at the chichi theme present throughout. The décor is cutting-edge, but the menu respects and returns to Italian standbys. Gnocco fritto, a dough pillow served with charcuterie, is irresistible to even the most willowy fashionistas; while cracker-crisp artisan pizzas from wood-burning ovens are equally pleasing. Traditional involtini di pollo, pounded thin and rolled around prosciutto, gets a hit of brightness from lemon and white wine sauce.",0,0
1019,Bangers & Lace,Gastropub,2,"Despite the frilly connotations, this sausage-and-beer mecca's name refers not to doilies, but to the delicate layers of foam that remain in the glass after your craft brew has been quaffed. You'll also have lots of opportunity to study the lace curtains as you plow through their extensive draft beer menu, noted on blackboards in the comfortably worn-in front bar room. Decadent foie gras corn dogs (actually French garlic sausage wrapped with soft-sweet brioche cornbread) and veal brats with melted Gouda elevate the humble sausage; while a slew of sandwiches suit simpler tastes. Grilled cheese gilds the lily with taleggio, raclette, and Irish cheddar; and dreamy house-made chips drizzled with truffle oil and malt vinegar are more than a bar snack.",0,0
1020,Carriage House,Southern,2,"Carriage House brings South Carolina hospitality to the heart of Wicker Park. Gauzy shades cover large windows in the understated dining room. Wire cage light fixtures lend farmhouse flair; while bentwood bistro chairs and tufted leather ottomans add a contemporary touch. The menu mixes traditional dishes with modern interpretations for a North-South blend of flavor and technique. Velvety Charleston she-crab soup is poured tableside over bright orange roe that bursts in the mouth. A scrumptious house-made garlic bologna- and pimento cheese-sandwich on brioche bridges the worlds of fine dining and country charm. Family-style suppers like a low-country boil with shrimp, clams, and rabbit chaurice sausage are meant to be shared around a table of friends.",0,0
1021,Nuevo Léon,Mexican,1,"Nuevo Leon's colorful trompe l'oeil exterior is almost as loud as the din inside this family favorite in the heart of Pilsen. A jukebox competes with the chatter as it blasts Mexican tunes throughout multiple dining rooms, bouncing off clay tile floors and rattling the hand-painted plates on festive yellow walls. The crowds come for large portions of straightforward Mexican favorites like slabs of carne asada with warm corn tortillas to wrap the lightly seasoned meat and beans. Munch on a complimentary beef-and-potato soft taco while poring over the extensive menu. Sizzling platters arrive in a heartbeat once the order's been placed. Just add summery tomato salsa or taqueria-style pickled carrots and jalapeños to give each bite a bit more zing.",0,0
1022,Black Bull,Spanish,1,"Like bulls, hungry foodies are drawn to the color red-at least that's what the thinking must be at this chic tapas spot dominated by a neon bull and candy-apple exterior. Inside, glasses of crimson and rosé sangria are in everyone's hands, helping the noise skyrocket as the night wears on. Look at the colorful chalk-drawn mural above the kitchen, depicting Spanish scenes, products, and food terms, to get a sense of what's on offer. Shareable plates mix tradition with contemporary twists, like crispy hollowed-out patatas bravas filled with ketchup and aïoli. A half-dozen pickled mussels arrive in a tin beneath a layer of creamy potato foam; while an excellent consommé poured over a farm egg yolk and truffles is brightened by a dash of manzanilla sherry.",0,0
1023,Pl-zeň,Gastropub,2,"The beckoning tentacles of an enormous octopus painted on a brownstone point the way to this quirky subterranean spot. More murals lead diners down a brick-lined alley and into the dining room, where the dim space is lightened by blonde wood bar stools and a hospitable vibe from the cool young staff. Though both chilaquiles and sesame-crusted tilapia tacos find their way on to the menu, Pl-zenˇ offers a full slate of gastropub fare that steps away from the traditional Mexican bent of the neighborhood. Raisin- and pignoli-studded boar meatballs are simmered in tomato sauce and finished with ricotta and caramelized onions. A poached egg adds richness to crispy pig ear salad with Fresno chili aïoli. Cinnamon-sugar beignets deserve a dip in luscious strawberry-pinot grigio sauce.",0,0
1024,Mott St.,Fusion,2,"New Yorkers know Mott St. as the bustling artery in the heart of Chinatown, but to Chicagoans the name connotes something off the beaten path. Inside the low-slung, standalone red structure, a chicken wire-caged pantry is stocked with jars of red pepper, black vinegar, and other pungent edibles-all of which appear again in the food on your plate. Offerings at this hip haven crisscross the globe, melding diverse ingredients for an utterly unique dining experience. Shredded kohlrabi substitutes green papaya for a Thai-inspired salad tossed with candied shrimp, poached chicken, and plenty of fresh herbs. Stuffed cabbage bears a Korean accent with tender chunks of slow-braised pork, tangy Napa cabbage kimchi, and crunchy sticky rice.",0,0
1025,Mana Food Bar,Vegetarian,1,"Feeling like your body needs a jump-start? Mana, whose name translates to ""the life force coursing through nature,"" is a good place to get your mojo back. Though welcoming to vegans, vegetarians, gluten-free diners, and anyone who's looking for a nutrient boost, it's not just health food: the small space also offers a full bar with sake cocktails, smoothies, and freshly squeezed juices. Mana may be a tiny spot, but its diverse menu of vegetarian dishes is big on taste-and spice. Korean bibimbap mixes a roster of vegetables like pea pods, roasted carrots, and pickled daikon with a fresh sunny side-up egg; while horseradish and cracked black pepper sneak into macaroni and cheese. House-made hot sauce with serranos and jalapeños adds extra pep to any dish.",0,0
1026,Kokopelli,Mexican,1,"This Wicker Park taqueria is the next best thing to a getaway from the shores of Lake Michigan to the Pacific Coast of Mexico. Sure, it's north of the border, but the cooking is as authentic as it gets. Inside, the space is warm and comfortable with bar seating aplenty, bright green banquettes, and an accent wall painted a shade that can only be described as Baja blue. Seafood is the focus of the unique menu, and octopus reigns supreme. The eight-armed delicacy works its way into a number of items including pulpo ceviche and the Kraken taco, which features a grilled, pesto-marinated version. Equally excellent are the poblano tacos stuffed with smoked rainbow trout, charred corn, and a creamy salsa made from roasted pumpkin seeds and Serrano chiles.",0,0
1027,Smoke Daddy,American,1,"After a renovation doubled the size of this barbecue joint and live music venue, it's become easier to grab a bite of burnt ends and a touch of the blues. The original room still oozes soul and smoke from its brick walls and vinyl floor, while the new space is bright and airy with a retractable glass door leading to an umbrella-shaded patio. No matter which barbecue style you pledge allegiance to-Kansas City, Memphis, or Carolina-you'll find something worth gnawing on, from moist pulled pork and chicken to spare and baby back ribs. Order any sandwich ""Daddy Style"" to get a few slices of brisket slapped on top, or fill up on jalapeño cornbread. Fans of the in-house Bloody Mary mix should grab a bottle to-go, along with smoked pig ears in a true doggy bag.",0,0
1028,Summer House Santa Monica,American,2,"Sunny days and southern California come to Lincoln Park in the form of this bright and breezy restaurant that resembles a beach house, albeit an enormous one with lots of house guests. It's the perfect choice for a summer's day-and not a bad one in the colder months, either if you're having a quick bite before the theater or want to shake off those winter blues for a while. There's even a countdown showing the number of days till summer. The menu proves a good fit for the surroundings by keeping things easy. There are sandwiches, tacos, and salads, but it's the meat and fish from the wood-fired oven that stand out. For dessert, choose a big cookie from the counter by the entrance. There's also a pizza restaurant and bar attached.",0,0
1029,Briciola,Italian,2,"After decades of cooking and traveling, Chef/owner Mario Maggi was ready to open a small place-just a crumb, or ""una briciola,"" of a restaurant. This tiny trattoria nestled between Ukrainian Village's brick buildings is indeed a speck of warmth and charm, festooned with party lights on the patio and mustard-toned walls inside. Traditional Italian cuisine gets personalized tweaks from the chef. Carpacci may include paper-thin octopus, beets, or beef; macaroncini alla Briciola folds diced Tuscan sausage into a spicy garlic-sage sauce; and a hefty bone-in pork chop, pounded thin, breaded, and pan-fried until golden, is a house classic dressed with arugula and shaved parmesan. A bottle from the wine shop down the block makes the meal even more convivial.",0,0
1030,Ada St.,Contemporary,2,"Despite its obscure location among the industrial warehouses of far-east Wicker Park, adventurous diners have no trouble seeking out Ada St. Reservations aren't accepted after 6:30 P.M., so the cozy, brick-walled lounge quickly becomes a party space where patrons peruse the wooden cubbies of vinyl to create their own soundtrack. The menu of small plates is influenced by both hearty gastropub dishes and lighter Mediterranean bites. Tabasco mash ketchup heats up a plate of charred, tender octopus, while a poached egg gilds rich duck confit tossed with cavatelli. Even the snappy green beans need nothing more than Dijon butter to shine. Before you take off, show your appreciation by choosing the last item on the menu: a six-pack of beer for the kitchen staff.",0,0
1031,Schwa,Contemporary,4,"There comes a point when pared-down style jumps from being easy-to-miss and becomes hard-to-forget (think security grills on the façade). When a utilitarian and self-consciously bare interior seems modern and industrial. When temporarily disconnected phone lines and full mailboxes make every hipster in the room feel like he hit the jackpot to score this reservation. The booming hip-hop peppered with expletives reflects the deeply talented chefs' ethos, going well beyond laissez-faire to reach the point of ""we don't give a damn."" That said, you probably won't either. The food really is that good. The 14-course nightly tasting has no menu really to speak of, but there are plenty of tattooed servers ready to describe each dish with details that come at you rapid fire. While some courses may seem way out of balance in terms of flavor and textural complexity, others have been known to show nuance and delicacy-as evident in the smooth and fine Osetra caviar sitting in a mélange of cashew nut purée, tender hearts of palm, and fried plantain chips; or a single quail egg raviolo with its glossy and unctuous brown butter sauce. Desserts can be pure genius, beginning with watermelon ice and unagi ice cream-a sprinkle of togarashi perfectly foils the intensity of this treat.",1,1
1032,Taus Authentic,International,2,"You'll want to make an evening of it at this Wicker Park newcomer, where a stylish front lounge-complete with a working fireplace-makes for a cozy spot to enjoy a beer or cocktail. Then you may proceed to linger over a meal in the beautiful dining room, a modern vision of wood, powder blue velvet, and plate glass windows. Chef Michael Taus has designed a menu made for grazing: think charcuterie, cheese, and starters including a sunchoke dosa. Made from lentils and basmati rice, this lacy crêpe is topped with chunks of tender sunchokes in a spicy red curry sauce sweetened by golden raisins and candied pumpkin seeds. A tasting portion of pan-seared fluke, plated with sweet chili vinaigrette and a Korean-style pancake studded with dried shrimp, is equally delicious.",0,0
1033,Gemini Bistro,American,2,"Opposites attract at this delightful neighborhood bistro that offers the best of both worlds: a chic, upscale setting with a casual, approachable attitude. Dark Venetian blinds and awnings remove outside distractions, letting guests focus their attention on the white marble bar and the lychee martinis shaken there. Most street parking in the area is permit only, so consider the valet. Seasonal American cooking pulls inspiration from the Mediterranean in dishes like plump double-boned pork chop Lyonnaise, cooked to a juicy medium, draped in herbed demi-glace, and nestled with cipollini onions and roasted fingerling potatoes. Smaller bites like a trio of seared scallops are paired with the timeless flavors of brown butter, capers, and lemon zest.",0,0
1034,Antique Taco,Mexican,1,"No reservations and walk-up counter service lead to an inevitable wait at Antique Taco (wear comfortable shoes). Ease the pain by browsing well-curated racks of knickknacks while awaiting market-fresh Mexican food, which arrives on abuela-worthy china plates. Place your order and score a wooden stool at a boxy plank table. Antique Taco piles its corn tortillas with substantial and delicious fillings. Crispy battered fish is spiced up with sriracha-tartar sauce and chilled smoked cabbage slaw. Shredded roast pork is rubbed with adobo, glazed in tamarind, and joined with creamy avocado and queso fresco for tasty carnitas. Pickled red onions add punch to chunky guacamole. Vodka-spiked agua frescas are nice, but the horchata milkshake is unmissable.",0,0
1035,Riccardo Trattoria,Italian,2,"The timeless wood-and-cream décor doesn't resemble an Italian nonna's kitchen, but no matter-the soulful personality of Chef/owner Riccardo Michi and his cache of family recipes make his eponymous restaurant a second home to nearly half the neighborhood. It's a spot that's suited for flirty date nights, boisterous dinners, and every occasion in between. As befits the word ""trattoria,"" rustic Italian preparations take precedence, but the simplicity satisfies. Chunks of pork sausage add heft to a heaping bowl of hand-rolled cavatelli bathed in a light tomato cream sauce, and curls of grilled calamari need only a squirt of lemon, splash of olive oil, and sprinkle of parsley to sing. For dessert, a thin, buttery tart shell cradles tender wine-poached pears.",0,0
1036,Oiistar,Asian,1,"It's easy to mistake Oiistar for yet another trendy ramen joint-but don't. Sure, it's got all the design hallmarks-from a minimalist wood-planked dining room and industrial open kitchen, to a turned-up soundtrack. But, the internationally influenced menu makes it much more than your average slurp shop. In fact, ""It's A Small World"" could be the unofficial theme song for their lineup of steamed buns and comforting ramen bowls showcasing noodles hand-pulled in-house each day: fiery kochujang complements barbecue chicken on the pollo bun, while the saltimbocca bun goes Italian with sage, prosciutto, and mozzarella. Extra special is the chadolmen, which blends a tangle of delicate wheat noodles with brisket and ground pork in a spicy miso and kimchi broth.",0,0
1037,Cumin,Indian,1,"This proudly-run blend of Nepalese and Indian eats sits among a plethora of bars, coffee shops, and vintage stores in boho-centric Bucktown. While fans of the sub-continent love Cumin for its clean and modern surrounds, linen-lined tables struggle to contain the myriad plates that pile up during its ubiquitous lunch buffet. Paintings of mountain scenes decorate crimson-red walls and prep diners for an authentic range of flavorful food hailing from the Northeast. Nibble on crispy samosas or onion bhajis (finely shredded onion fritters) teamed with mint chutney. Then soak pieces of buttery naan in rich and vibrant saag bobbing with soft chunks of chicken. For a sweet finale, dig into a creamy pistachio kulfi or opt for a light and fruity mango lassi.",0,0
1038,Takito Kitchen,Mexican,2,"Chicago's upscale taco circuit gets a new contender with Takito, where fresh ingredients make Latin-inspired food sing. Tequila takes pride of place in a chile-salted margarita, while skylights and mirrors make the narrow, mod-industrial space seem even brighter and larger. Sure, you can get a corn tortilla here, but sesame and hibiscus options let the kitchen get creative as evident in tacos filled with cornmeal-crusted redfish, beef barbacoa, or tamarind-chayote pequin. Shared plates like sope de carne asada blur culinary boundaries with the addition of Brunkow cheddar and green onion kimchi. It's an across-the-board mishmash of colorful flavors, but certainly a good way to go over the top. Sister spot Bar Takito also boasts a notably concise menu.",0,0
1039,Greentea,Japanese,2,"Regulars would rather your eyes glaze past Greentea's nondescript storefront so they can keep this secret to themselves. The bento box-sized room isn't glitzy, so the scene is limited to a few lucky cat sculptures and plants to punctuate the seafoam green walls. Otherwise, the focus is kept on the itamae in colorful chef's coats and the pristinely fresh seafood they're preparing. Purists love the well-priced nigiri, sashimi, and manageably sized rolls showcasing silky hamachi or glistening uni with a touch of minerality. Tiger Eyes salad is a visual showstopper: squid stuffed with smoked salmon, julienned cucumber, and marinated carrots sliced into thin rounds are a clever and flavorful resemblance to an orange-pupiled eye.",0,0
1040,Mirai,Japanese,2,"Mirai is a bit like Disney World. You know it's not real, but who cares? The Japanese food is westernized and by no means traditional, but unless you're dining out with Mr. Shinzo Abe, rest assured that nobody will cry foul. Bold and appetizing flavors beg to take center stage. It's really all about the fish at this spot-just look around and you'll find most devotees feasting on sashimi, unagi, and maki. If raw fish doesn't float your boat, take a shot at one of the house specialties like kani nigiri, a baked king crab concoction. There is also a surfeit of hot dishes-think chicken togarashi with spicy, sweet, and tangy flavors. Affable and alert service combined with a relaxed atmosphere make this a hit among area residents.",0,0
1041,Aquitaine,American,2,"When Lincoln Park locals want French-inspired cuisine, they head to Aquitaine for a taste of Chef/owner Holly Willoughby's refined cooking. Dim lighting and subtle brocade details on the walls keep the long, narrow dining room casually romantic, with enough simple sophistication to swing a Saturday night date or weekday post-work dinner. A well-priced wine list only adds to the elegant appeal. Large chunks of succulent lobster are a luxe touch in a ramekin of tender potato gnocchi bathed in creamy sauce. Eggplant, olive, and tomato relish give double-cut lamb chops a Provençal spin, heightened by a drizzle of basil pesto. Textbook-perfect crème brûlée needs only a tap of the spoon to send its delicate sugar crust splintering into the silken custard.",0,0
1042,Mon Ami Gabi,French,2,"A real French bistro can give an American steakhouse a run for its money in the meat department any day, and the 11 different steak preparations on Mon Ami Gabi's menu (all served with crispy golden frites) are justly impressive. Beyond the butcher case, a selection of satisfying Francophile classics keeps the sophisticated Chicago contingent returning to this cozy, stylish standby. Tradition reigns in the kitchen, where the emphasis is on flavorful and unpretentious dishes like seafood pot-au-feu bobbing with scallops and pepper-crusted cod fillet in a tasty fennel broth. Pickled cornichons and warm toast points make a meal out of house-made country pâté. And for an indulgent finish, split a plate of warm caramel-drizzled pineapple crêpes.",0,0
1043,Nando Milano Trattoria,Italian,2,"A corner bar television constantly tuned to (European) football, vintage aperitivo posters, and a welcoming patio tailor-made for afternoon glasses of prosecco: charismatic host Dario Vullo has installed his own little slice of Milan in Wicker Park. The chic trattoria offers an intensely Italian menu and wine list to match the authentic accents of Vullo and family. A trio of arancini are playfully prepared, with each rice ball sporting a unique shape-sphere, triangle, and cube-to denote a special filling like Bolognese ragù and smoked mozzarella; or mascarpone and spinach. House-made pastas like beet gnocchi in saffron sauce steal the show from equally flavorful and fresh focaccia sandwiches layered with creamy burrata and Prosciutto di Parma.",0,0
1044,Las Palmas,Mexican,2,"Vivid décor complements the spirited flavors on the menu at Las Palmas, from the colorful Mexican artwork on adobe-style walls to exposed ductwork welded to resemble a scaly dragon winding through the deceptively large space. If the weather suits, the outdoor garden or glassed-in atrium beckon; if not, a cozy fireplace in the front room keeps things intimate. The cocktail menu draws inspiration from both South and Central America, featuring a variety of capirinhas and mojitos alongside inventive cucumber-lime and pineapple margaritas. Vibrant and modern Mexican dishes like crispy taquitos with chicken barbacoa, pickled red onion, and tangy salsa cruda; as well as seafood-filled cornmeal empanadas with peanut-jalapeño relish showcase the kitchen's flair.",0,0
1045,Lillie's Q,Barbecue,2,"Bucktown's urban barbecue shack takes a scholarly approach to 'cue, as each table bears a caddy stocked with six regionally specific sauces for embellishing the slow-smoked meats to come. Cocktails served in Mason jars are a specialty made from ""moonshine"" offered at three proof levels, and servers in modern mechanic's shirts tend to the crowds clamoring for heaps of smoked meats rubbed in ""Carolina dirt."" Tri-tip is tender and pink-tinged after its time in the smoker with the joint's signature dry rub; while the succulent smoked hot link rests in a butter-griddled, top-sliced brioche bun served with Southern-style coleslaw. And if at-home grilling is your thing, you'll be pleased to know that the mouthwatering sauces are available by mail order.",0,0
1046,Rickshaw Republic,Indonesian,1,"The captivating flavors of Southeast Asian street food are matched by the creative design at this friendly, family-run Lincoln Avenue space. Color and pattern collide as parasols, puppets, and bird cages vie for attention with abstract Indonesian wood carvings. Once the food arrives, though, the spotlight shifts to the aromatic plates. Start with crisp martabak crêpes that behold a savory combination of beef, onions, and egg. Then move on to lemongrass-braised chicken thighs in a turmeric-tinged coconut curry with sweet and spicy tamarind sambal and pickled cabbage. Surprise your palate with es cendol, a mix of coconut milk and green pandan jelly in palm sugar syrup. Finally, take one of Mama Setiawan's homemade sambals home to bring color to your cooking.",0,0
1047,Big Star,Mexican,1,"Bucktown's favorite taqueria has all the fixings for a fiesta. Craft beers, custom-bottled Bourbons, and pitchers of margaritas wash down the affordable abundance. And, despite the grungy décor, the vibe is as intoxicating as the aroma of the taco de chorizo verde. The patio is even more of a party, and sun-starved Chicagoans can be spotted out there soon after the groundhog has (or hasn't) seen his shadow. Tacos are served individually, thus allowing ample opportunity to graze on the likes of the pollo pibil-achiote- and citrus-marinated chicken thighs steamed in banana leaves, topped with pickled onion slices and cilantro. Save room for the salsa de frijole con queso, a crock of pinto bean dip accompanied by lime salt-sprinkled tortilla chips.",0,0
1048,Taxim,Greek,2,"Though Taxim channels the spirit of Greece in its food, the Moroccan-esque décor takes inspiration from Turkey and other Mediterranean coastal neighbors. The large room glints with light from hanging Moorish lanterns and copper-topped tables. Share small plates on the sidewalk patio to take full advantage of Wicker Park people-watching. Many of Taxim's dishes get a modern twist while remaining respectful to the islands' traditional cuisine. Wild Greek oregano and ouzo-preserved lemon offer a perfect balance to roasted Amish Miller Farms chicken; while loukoumades prove that no one can resist fried dough, especially when tossed in wildflower honey and topped with rosewater-infused pastry cream. The all-Greek wine list is an adventure for oenophiles.",0,0
1049,Dove's Luncheonette,American,2,"With a chill, throwback vibe, all-day breakfast, and a drink list with more than 70 labels of agave spirits, this One Off Hospitality roadhouse is a Wicker Park hipster's dream come true. To drive the point home, the diner features wood-paneled walls, counter seating, a record player spinning the blues, and of course, Tex-Mex fare listed on a wall-mounted letter board. The daily special may be a blueberry quinoa pancake, while savory favorites include crunchy buttermilk fried chicken with chorizo verde gravy or the farmer's cheese-stuffed Anaheim chile relleno, served in a pool of tomato-serrano sauce with pasilla chiles and pickled chayote slices. Pies from Hoosier Mama Pie Co. are a grand finale; try the lemony Atlantic Beach with a saltine crust.",0,0
1050,White Oak Tavern & Inn,American,2,"Though there was a late summer (2015) transition in chefs, a creative sense of flavor combinations and technical finesse continue to flourish at this appealingly rustic restaurant and inn. Midwestern hospitality and bounty are at the forefront here, and every ingredient on each section of the multi-category menu is of irreprehensible quality. The in-house cheese-making and bread programs are on full display as evidenced in a bowl of stracciatella, where mozzarella mingles with pickled shallot rings next to fluffy, griddled focaccia sticks. A whiff of smoke uplifts moist, meaty sturgeon, simply seared and surrounded by candied hickory nuts and nutty crème fraîche; while a refined and clever root vegetable tartare is deliciously crowned by a sous vide duck egg.",0,0
1051,Enso,Japanese,2,"All bases are covered at Enso, from tempura to ramen and chirashi to teriyaki, but it's mostly about maki. There are fairly classic combinations of ingredients on offer, but also more challenging blends of flavor. If you can't decide then you can always ""make your own maki""-but you'll only have yourself to blame should the memory of your chosen flavors return to haunt you at a later date. The homemade steamed buns are also worthy; a filling of roasted pork belly with pickled vegetables inside one of these little pillows of delight is hard to beat. The vaulted room looks like a Goth's cellar, all black and moody, with the open kitchen at the far end shining like a beacon of hope. Larger parties should try to snare one of the low-slung booths.",0,0
1052,The Duck Inn,American,2,"Grab a taxi and head to the warehouses of Bridgeport, where this stylish, modern tavern-from neighborhood native Kevin Hickey-feels like a diamond in the rough. Through a set of French doors, the hubbub brought on by intricate cocktails in the retro globe-lit lounge leads to a decorous dining room with wide wooden tables and curvy midcentury seating. Beyond the kitchen's signature rotisserie duck for two, the menu spreads its wings with a focused but diverse selection of small plates and entrées. Briny sea beans are the crowning touch to a winning dish of uni butter-slathered spot prawns and creamy risotto, while a duo of pickle- and beer-brined chicken thigh and drumstick glisten with a tableside finish of smoked paprika jus.",0,0
1053,Bourgeois Pig Cafe,Deli,1,"Scholarly types from nearby DePaul University adore this bookish café on a quiet block of Fullerton. Choose from a litany of salads, sandwiches, and drinks from oversized chalkboard menus behind the counter; then stake out one of the premium second-floor tables. Upstairs, chandeliers, cozy couches, and scattered antiques (not to mention frequent study groups guzzling caffeine and homemade cookies) lend character. Many sandwiches take names from literary works, like The Old Man and the Sea (tuna salad) or Catcher in the Rye (reuben). The muffuletta is a lightly pressed panini rendition of the New Orleans standard, stacking a deli's worth of ham, salami, mortadella, provolone, and mild giardiniera in fresh focaccia for a hearty yet delicate bite.",0,0
1054,Trenchermen,Contemporary,2,"In old-timey slang, a trencherman is a hearty eater and drinker, a definition that lets you know what you're in for at this glossy but comforting Wicker Park gastropub. Housed in a former Russian bathhouse, the black-and-white tiles and notched brick walls dividing the eclectic warren of rooms give a nod to the former tenant of this 1920s building. Bar snacks and weekend brunch are taken just as seriously as full-on lunch and dinner here. Corned beef adds a manly touch to eggs Benedict, especially when drizzled with piquant choron sauce. Dense pretzel cinnamon rolls straddle the salty-sweet line. A menu favorite at any time of day, fried pickle tots are served with kicky beet-tinged red onion yogurt and thinly sliced chicken breast bresaola.",0,0
1055,Fiesta Mexicana,Mexican,1,"Cheerful and bright, Fiesta Mexicana is truly a party for the eyes and tastebuds. High-ceilinged rooms are lined with colorful murals of small-town life, and wide-open front windows invite in warm evening breezes. Live mariachi bands turn up the heat on weekends. Creative Mexican fare begins with the usual suspects like tacos al pastor and piquant, spunky house-made salsa, but unique dishes broaden the offerings. Here, a bowl of fundido is a Latin cousin to spinach-and-artichoke dip, with a blend of tangy cheeses and plenty of roasted poblanos for extra heat. Pan-fried pork tenderloin medallions come smothered in tomatillo sauce alongside drunken beans, bacon-wrapped shrimp, and a side of smashed red potatoes with oozing Chihuahua cheese.",0,0
1056,Mindy's Hot Chocolate,Contemporary,2,"Bucktown wouldn't be the same without this sweet spot run by pastry chef extraordinaire, Mindy Segal. Diners walk past decadent hot chocolate mix and cookies on display before hitting an industrial-chic space fitted out with sleek dark wood, caramel-brown walls, and chocolate-toned leather banquettes. Get the point yet? Decadent chocolate is the name of the game here, though guests will be delighted to discover savory items beyond their expectations. Try the roasted tomato soup, garnished with bright green onion slivers; or the BLT with pesto aïoli, heirloom tomato, avocado, and thick, crispy maple-cayenne bacon. An affogato-a scoop of coffee-cocoa nib ice cream paired with the chef's namesake hot chocolate-makes for the perfect finale.",0,0
1057,EL Ideas,Contemporary,4,"Free your mind, keep your expectations high, and ignore the hand-made sign and desolate locale that make this undeniably edgy restaurant feel like a David Lynch movie. No one comes here for high-end pampering. Rather, the interior is an amalgam of heavy wood timber, zinc ductwork, abstract art, and a homespun curtain made of wine corks. The open kitchen and its team of freewheeling anti-heroes lend a dinner-party vibe, with guests bringing bottles of Bourbon as gifts for the chefs and others getting up to mingle. Woe to those who come here to dine alone. This prix-fixe is an all-embracive antithesis to highfalutin fine dining, with courses that the chef might describe as salty-sweet stoner food. Envision golden-fried potatoes in a piping hot leek soup, topped with liquid nitrogen-prepared vanilla ice cream that pops and crackles when poured overtop. The result is a brilliant playfulness that hits all the right gustatory notes. Seared venison may arrive with plump morels, jicama brunoise, beluga lentils, and wonderfully bright green garlic ""slaw."" Flavor, texture, and presentation reach their height in the chartreuse cake with candied fennel, wild huckleberries, and white chocolate crémeux.",1,1
1058,Pequod's Pizza,Pizza,1,"Ditch your diet, grab your fellow Blackhawks fans, and head to this Lincoln Park stalwart for some of the best pies in town. Christened for Captain Ahab's sailing ship, Pequod's menu promises smooth sailing for sports bar noshers, featuring a lineup of shareable bar snacks such as wings and mozzarella sticks, hearty sandwiches like tender Italian beef, and both thin-crust and deep-dish pan pizzas. Grab that cutlery before digging into the buttery crust of each deep-dish pie, ringed with blackened cheese at the edges. Then toppings like pepperoni, fresh garlic, and crunchy sautéed onions are generously layered between tart tomato sauce and handfuls of cheese for an oozy jumble in every bite. A towering wedge of fudge cake awaits those with room for dessert.",0,0
1059,de Quay,Fusion,2,"Given its history as a former colony, the Dutch have developed a great deal of appreciation for Indonesian culinary tradtions. And, Chef/owner David de Quay pulls from his family heritage to bring the two together at his eponymous restaurant. Delft pottery houses and sleek teak wood wall accents are visual mementos of this union. On the menu, sweet-and-sour babi panggang departs from its traditional pairing with roast pork to heighten succulent grilled shrimp and fragrant lemongrass lumpia. Crisp-edged dumplings enclose a creamy potato-and-Gouda filling that is studded with bacon and English peas. Chewy house-made stroopwafels sandwich warm spiced caramel with vanilla bean-flecked ice cream for an unforgettable finis.",0,0
1060,Kai Zan,Japanese,2,"A recent expansion has doubled the space of Kai Zan's tiny empire on far western Chicago Avenue, adding multi-rooms of wooden tables and benches next to the original sliver of a marble sushi counter. Make a reservation to guarantee a spot at the counter, where it's a pleasure to watch chefs and twin brothers Melvin and Carlo Vizconde work in synchronicity. Though known for its sushi, grilled items like juicy beef tongue complement the roster of exceptionally fresh bites. Smoky seared saba and octopus sashimi are served with typically restrained seasoning, needing nothing more than a dab of soy and dip in pickled wasabi sauce. Monthly specials may include Eskimo clouds, a poetic name for escolar-wrapped kushi oysters with Tabasco-ponzu foam.",0,0
1061,Han 202,Asian,2,"In a neighborhood dominated by sports bars and Irish pubs, Han 202 stands apart as a sophisticated pan-Asian alternative for White Sox watchers. Bare wood tables and high-backed coffee-and-cream leather seats convey polish-an attitude reinforced by the skilled chefs and servers. Dramatic driftwood sculpture and framed art play against pale walls. The $35 four-course prix-fixe menu is a true bargain, with each course punctuated by precisely cut fresh bites of sushi. Jeju Island hirame is lightly brushed with mirin and kissed with wasabi. Lobster tail arrives warm and buttery with a dollop of fresh ricotta and tender red beet halves, drizzled with olive oil. Seared duck breast adds juicy flavor to standard steamed vegetables in a fermented bean sauce.",0,0
1062,Birchwood Kitchen,American,1,"Every neighborhood needs a spot like this, where one can order a bowl of turkey chili followed by sourdough waffles simply because the mood strikes. (Speaking of the chili, it's perfectly spicy and studded with white beans, and those waffles arrive with vanilla bean butter and warm maple syrup.) The vibe here is enhanced by service that charms, and the team goes beyond mere smiles to engage with diners, even offering a cup of coffee for the road to help defend against winter's icy blast. This ""Kitchen's"" periwinkle façade stands out like a gem. Inside, a refrigerated glass case displays lemon bars, chocolate chip-banana bread, and other goodies to-go. And, the low-key crowd seated along old church pews lining exposed brick walls, are loyal for good reason.",0,0
1063,En Hakkore,Korean,1,"Healthy doesn't have to be humdrum. This simple little Korean eatery, run by a husband-and-wife team and decorated with more than a hint of whimsy, specializes in big bowls of bibimbap. You choose your rice and protein, be it pork or barbecue beef, decide on the heat level and then dive straight in-up to 16 different vegetables are used and they're as tasty as they are colorful. Also worth trying are the steamed mandoo (pork dumplings) and the curiously addictive tacos made with paratha. Simply place your order at the counter, grab a plastic fork and, if you're with friends, commandeer the large communal table. There's no alcohol (and it's not BYOB) so instead take advantage of an invigorating soft drink from the fridge. You'll feel so virtuous.",0,0
1064,Frances' Deli,Deli,1,"Frances' Deli is the type of quaint, lived-in diner everyone dreams of having just around the corner from home. Lucky Lincoln Park residents get that wish fulfilled at this authentic pre-war haunt packed with American antiques and memorabilia-where weekend waits are the norm as half the neighborhood vies for a place at one of the closely spaced tables. As with any good diner, breakfast, lunch, and dinner all know how to hit the spot. The deli roasts its own meats and does Jewish-American staples right, from flavorful, crisp-tender potato pancakes to oversized pastrami and brisket sandwiches with all the fixings (slaw, fries, and potato salad). As long as you're going for the full nostalgia trip, slurp down a made-to-order milkshake or malt.",0,0
1065,North Pond,Contemporary,3,"Sitting just north of the pond, this former warming house for ice skaters has been reconceived as a chic Craftsman-style cottage with windows overlooking the shimmering water. Flickering candles and wood accents make it feel like a remote forest lodge, and a quote from Chaucer over the wine rack enhances the overall historic feel. Both the reasonably priced à la carte and fixed menus appear simple, listing one or two main seasonal ingredients often repeated with new insight throughout a meal. However, each dish elevates farm-to-table cooking with creative exploration. This is at once clear in the ""egg, bacon,"" its velvety yolk ready to spill over and lushly sauce the roasted rapini, bacon confit, and dark slice of toasted pumpernickel beneath. This may be followed by pearly white fluke set over deep-green kale braised with bacon and paired with shards of crisped kale, juice-like kale foam, as well as bacon bits, purple potato slices, sweet apple balls, toasted hazelnuts, and a single, succulent Gulf shrimp. Finish with a quenelle of unique smoked olive oil sorbet paired with torn pieces of herbaceous rosemary cake, cinnamon-laced apple, spiced pecans, puffs of apple foam, and salt-pepper crumble. Then breathe a sigh of supreme satisfaction.",1,1
1066,Del Seoul,Korean,1,"Korean street food makes its way from the trendy trucks to a fast-casual space that gives the people what they crave. All the intoxicating flavors of Korean cuisine are here in finger food form, perfect for sharing or creating your own personal buffet. Choose from the video screens above the counter, take a number, and grab a seat. Bite-sized barbecue tacos are the star of the menu, filled with a variety of meats including kalbi-style braised beef short ribs or panko-breaded sesame-chili shrimp. Both get a topping of bright cilantro-onion slaw on grilled white corn tortillas. Canadian poutine crosses a number of borders when topped with more of those tender short ribs, house-made kimchi, pickled red onions, and a trio of melted cheddar, jack, and crema.",0,0
1067,Le Bouchon,French,2,"Pressed-tin ceiling? Check. Brick-and-Dijon color scheme? Check. Close-knit tables in a snug space? Check. A warm welcome from an actual Frenchman? Check. Owner Jean-Claude Poilevey has fashioned the quintessential bistro experience at Le Bouchon, where straightforward French food never goes out of style. The informal atmosphere gets convivially raucous as the night goes on with regulars lining the bar and petite dining room. Familiar, approachable favorites rule the menu: soupe à l'oignon, wearing its traditional topper of broiled Gruyère on a moist crouton, oozes and bubbles over the sides of a ramekin; and an ample fillet of saumon poché napped in beurre blanc is the essence of simplicity. A lunch prix-fixe keeps the wallet light but belly full.",0,0
1068,Homestyle Taste,Chinese,1,"For more adventurous fare than spicy Sichuan lamb or dim sum, look no further than this family-run favorite. Though the lengthy menu offers plenty of usual suspects (think scallion pancakes and mapo tofu), it's also chock-full of authentic Chinese dishes that will make any offal lover's day. Thin slices of lamb kidney are dry stir-fried, their mild flavor boosted by copious amounts of cumin and red chilies. Then, a sweet and sour sauce offsets the funky flavor of quick-fried intestine, tripe, and liver; and pickled cabbage and pork meatball soup, boosted by tofu and noodles, is a welcome warmer on cold days. The service is friendly and amenable, so don't be afraid to specify your preferred meat or ask for chili oil to amplify the heat quotient.",0,0
1069,Izakaya Mita,Japanese,1,"This Bucktown addition is a family-run tavern worth seeking out for its homespun take on izakaya eats and gracious hospitality. Start with single-serve sake in a jar so cute you'll want to smuggle it home, or a cocktail inspired by Japanese literature (the Norwegian Wood, a delicious interpretation of the Haruki Murakami novel ""Noruwei no Mori,"" blends whiskey, Luxurdo, sweet vermouth, and orange bitters).The array of small plates brims with creativity and flavor: tsukune are coarse-ground, delightfully chewy, and achieve a mouthwateringly charred exterior from having been grilled over bincho-tan; while tako-yaki are as delicious as any found on a Tokyo sidewalk. Korroke, a panko-crusted potato croquette, comes with tonkatsu sauce for delicious dunking.",0,0
1070,Pizzeria da Nella,Italian,2,"Though it calls itself a pizzeria, this cheerful and vast Italian hang near DePaul University is so much more. A mosaic-tiled wood-burning oven gleams from the rear of the dimly lit space, brightened by sunny yellow and Mediterranean blue walls. Craft beer nerds should take a seat at the bar for a sampling from the varied list of artisanal Italian brews. Authentic Neapolitan pizzas share menu space with modern stuffed ""bomba"" pies like the Ciotta Ciotta, which mounds a deli case's worth of salumi and cheeses between two pizza dough rounds. Pasta selections are equally sprawling, and include fresh combinations like pappardelle with plump mussels, black truffles, and pecorino. Limoncello-soaked strawberries over homemade sponge cake keep the finale light.",0,0
1071,La Plena,Latin American,1,"Owners Epi and Soraya Velez have created a warm and welcoming haven for anyone hoping to enjoy a little piece of Puerto Rico in Chicago. Their home-style cooking would make any Boricua proud, offering standards from mofongo to lechon and even the holiday favorite of coquito-with much less of the heaviness often associated with the traditional cuisine. As the story goes, the jibarito was created by Chicago's Puerto Rican community, and La Plena's rendition-featuring thin steak strips, garlicky mayonnaise, and melted cheese between fried flattened plantains-is an exceptional example. For dessert, dig into a slice of dense, eggy flan while you take in the dining room's custom murals that showcase Puerto Rico's beaches and countryside.",0,0
1072,Coast Sushi Bar,Japanese,2,"Dimly lit but lively, this high-volume sushi bar cranks out a remarkable variety of rolls to keep up with demand especially on weekends from noon till night. Two spacious dining rooms and a narrow sushi counter armed with wood-framed chairs accommodate the chatty crowds. Bring your own sake, wine, and bottle opener to make the wait more tolerable. The broad selection of Japanese dishes ranges from signature maki and nigiri to innovative appetizers like fried soft-shell crab with mango-shallot salsa. Miso soup spiked with jalapeño is served in a coffee cup for easy sipping. A deep bowl of boatman chirashi is laden with orange tobiko, pickled veggies, shiso leaves, and an array of sashimi. Dig right in or grab a sheet of toasted nori for a custom-wrapped hand roll.",0,0
1073,Juno,Japanese,3,"Raw fish with a side of creativity differentiates Juno from the rest of this city's sushi brethren. With a plain, tavern-like bar up front as well as a bright, inviting dining room and counter (the best seat in the house) in back, this low-key spot is popular for a casual meal. The menu offers cool bites like the Juno queen, a special nigiri of salmon topped with spicy scallop and potato crunch; and hot treats like honey-glazed quail. Chef B.K. Park's omakase must be ordered 48-hours in advance, but with cleverly spun morsels like briefly torched prawn with pineapple salsa, pickled garlic oil-drizzled New Zealand King salmon, soy-marinated sea eel dabbed with ground sesame seeds, and spicy octopus temaki, it's a feast well worth the extra effort.",0,0
1074,Nana,American,2,"While Nana Solis is the matriarch of this family-run Bridgeport favorite, her children (who were raised just upstairs) keep the kitchen and dining room humming. A devoted breakfast crowd takes up residence at the coffee bar and butcher block tables each day, often perusing the colorful modern artwork for sale on the walls. Locally sourced and organic are the guiding principles behind every ingredient here; many dishes also get a little Latin flavor. Soft avocado wedges are tossed in panko, then flash-fried for a crispy exterior and creamy center. ""Nanadicts"" give a Southwestern accent to eggs Benedict by adding chorizo, corn pupusas, and poblano cream. Sunday nights feature family-style fried chicken dinners fit for large groups with larger appetites.",0,0
1075,mfk.,Spanish,2,"""First we eat, then we do everything else,"" said M.F.K. Fisher, the food writer who serves as both the inspiration and namesake for this young neighborhood darling. Thanks to large windows, whitewashed brick walls, and gleaming silver-and-white tilework, the subterranean space manages to evoke a breezy seaside oasis. And with a seafood-centric menu featuring modern interpretations of Iberian-inspired plates, the food follows suit. The ocean's bounty is showcased in simple but flavorful dishes, like crispy fried prawn heads served with a nutty salbitxada sauce for dipping; and bowls of cataplana stew with fresh clams, crunchy shrimp, and grilled cobia collar. A crumbly slice of Basque cake and an expertly pulled cortado ends the meal on a high note.",0,0
1076,Red Door,International,2,"Even with no sign, it's easy to find this funky Bucktown bar: that red door is impossible to miss. Grab a metal barstool or a raised wooden banquette for an evening of seasonal cocktails, craft beers, and internationally inspired pub fare. On warm evenings, the backyard patio becomes romantic with candlelit communal tables and a canopy of twinkling lights overhead. Gastropub classics take a spin around the globe, while often featuring local ingredients (sometimes right from the patio). Bulgogi-style hanger steak and eggs is a weekend brunch favorite, layering tender chunks of meat over scrambled eggs with a pile of spicy, hangover-busting kimchi on the side. Poutine boasts Wisconsin's Brunkow cheese curds and spicy curry gravy.",0,0
1077,The Bristol,American,2,"Get to know your neighbors a little better at this dim, bustling haunt boasting a lineup of seasonal American treats with a Mediterranean twist. Regulars sit shoulder-to-shoulder at thick butcher block communal tables or at the concrete bar, squinting under filament bulbs to see the constantly changing menu's latest additions on chalkboards throughout the room. After sharing a Moscow Mule in a frosty copper mug, duck fat fries, or monkey bread with dill butter, it might be time for messy elotes tossed with sweet chili jam to be licked off each finger; or an heirloom tomato tart with a SarVecchio cheese crust and shaved onions. Do the right thing and save room for homemade Nutter Butter cookies with dark chocolate sabayon for dipping.",0,0
1078,Belly Shack,Fusion,1,"Belly Shack's concise menu is an eclectic Asian-Latin mash-up that reflects the Korean and Puerto Rican backgrounds of Chef Bill Kim and his wife, Yvonne Cadiz-Kim. Place your order and take a number-a metal stand that looks like it was made by a high school shop class-then wait for your dishes to arrive. Korean barbecued beef is a favorite, but regulars enjoy new tastes from the roster of daily specials that can include the lechon tostada. This treat is comprised of thinly sliced, slow-roasted pork loin piled high onto a fried corn tortilla with grated sharp cheddar, mashed smoky black beans, and pineapple-cilantro salsa. For dessert, lick up peaks of creamy vanilla soft-serve with topping combos such as caramel and freshly grated Vietnamese cinnamon.",0,0
1079,Bar Pastoral,International,2,"When Wrigleyville denizens want to say cheese, they head to Bar Pastoral, the rustic bistro companion to an artisan cheese and wine shop. Subtly styled like a cave for aging, the restaurant's barrel-vaulted ceilings and exposed brick walls evoke intimacy. A glossy half-moon bar, marble-topped cheese counter, and rustic wood tables inlaid with wooden wine box details let guests gather and sample. As expected, many dishes feature cheese, though shareable plates run from house-made charcuterie to bone-in pork chops. Thick slices of bacon-wrapped country pâté are generously studded with pistachios. A succinct wine list offers a number of by-the-glass selections for pairing with cheese-such as the raw cow's milk Kentucky Rose served with caramelized onion chutney.",0,0
1080,Chilam Balam,Mexican,2,"Chilam Balam's cozy subterranean space feels like an undiscovered hideaway, but the secret of this lively Mexican hot spot is out. Though waits can be long, the accommodating staff goes the extra mile to mix up margaritas with BYO tequila or walk guests through the rotating roster of shared plates. Familiar favorites and seasonal specials make for a festive mix of adventurous, yet universally pleasing dishes. Flat corn tortillas form a sandwich-style enchilada, stuffed with fork-tender beef brisket and topped with crunchy strands of sweet potato slaw. Salty chorizo and green papaya tlacoyos show that opposites attract, and peanut butter empanadas-primed for dipping in Oaxacan chocolate sauce and dulce de leche-take a childhood favorite to new heights.",0,0
1081,DMK Burger Bar,American,1,"Outside, towering neon ""DMK"" letters shine like a beacon for burger fanatics; inside, craft beers gush from taps and attentive, accommodating servers sling mile-high piles of fries. With blaring music and church pew-lined banquettes, it's a cool and modern hang for families and friends of all ages. Sate salt cravings with a batch of batter-fried okra pods and tangy pickle spears dipped in creamy herbed ranch; then order by number to get the creative grass-fed burger of your choice. The #3 takes on a Reuben with pastrami, sauerkraut, and Gruyère; while #9 is the platonic ideal of a patty melt, with smoked Swiss, caramelized onions, and chewy bacon between caraway-studded slices of rye bread. Save room for #15-the always-interesting daily special.",0,0
1082,Fish Bar,Seafood,2,"Chicago may not be known for local seafood, but Fish Bar makes sure to handpick the best from both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to fill its chilled coffers. A blackboard above the semi-open kitchen lists the fresh daily fish and oyster offerings, ready to be shucked, steamed, fried, and grilled for guests lining up at the wood bar that snakes around the room. The casual menu pays homage to classic coastal fish shacks, yet throws in a few gussied-up items like tartare and octopus à la plancha. Bowls of gumbo stick to the classic recipe with zippy andouille sausage, okra, and chunks of blue crab. The Satchmo po'boy is a mouthful, combining fried rock shrimp and crawfish tails along with slaw and sweet pickles in a traditional, buttery split-top roll.",0,0
1083,ATK,Thai,2,"Chef Andy Aroonrasameruang's Thai kitchen has earned numerous accolades and a devout following in its brief existence. Bring friends and settle in to the slender, spotless room arranged with ebony-finished tables and accent walls painted with hues evocative of turmeric and purple onion. Cooked-to-order creations are spicy, sour, crunchy, and aromatic-as in the snappy Isaan-style sausage sided by a mouthwatering dipping sauce. The kao soy features thin egg noodles in a rich golden-yellow curry stocked with pounded chicken, bean sprouts, raw cabbage, and pickled mustard greens-all topped by a nest of crunchy fried noodles. The duck in red curry is chili-revved, redolent of five-spice, and balanced by the sweetness of diced pineapple, grapes, and tomato.",0,0
1084,La Casa De Samuel,Mexican,1,"Though the sign over the awning reads ""Cocina Internacional,"" make no mistake: this Mexican restaurant has been bringing tacos and queso fundido to Pilsen since 1989. Exposed wood beams, brick walls, and bright oil paintings add a true-blue vibe; while a tortilla station where an abuelita works masa into thin discs gets the appetite going. Multi-generational families return time and again to share spicy molcajete-crushed salsa. Along with the freshly made tortillas that arrive swaddled and warm from the grill, the bustling kitchen turns out solid standards like fajitas as well as unusual wild game options like grilled wild boar, rabbit, or alligator.

1085,"Table, Donkey and Stick",Austrian,2,"When American comfort food just won't suffice, look to Table, Donkey and Stick for a helping of cozy Alpine fare. The rustic inn-inspired setting reflects its reputation as a gathering place where friends meet at the inviting bar or settle in at communal tables for whimsical, creative compositions. Though the food is European-influenced, ingredients from local farms make their way into many dishes. Caraway seeds spice up duck meatballs nestled among springy egg noodles with dehydrated sauerkraut and shaved salted egg yolk, and honeycomb tripe wins new fans when fried to a crisp and topped with house-made giardiniera. For a sweet take on the traditional baked good, try the pretzel-shaped puff pastry sprinkled with candied mustard seeds.",0,0
1086,Kanela,American,1,"A comfortable, lived-in setting makes this breakfast club more like a home away from home for many Lakeview residents. The cozy chocolate-brown dining room packs in hungry brunchers on weekends, but the flung-open front windows, efficient kitchen (and a Bloody Mary or two) keep everyone happy. Since Kanela is Greek for ""cinnamon,"" the signature pastry is appropriately loaded with spiced sugar, vanilla frosting, and blueberries. A flight of four kinds of French toast sweetens the deal for indecisive types. But savory brunchers have a host of options too, including the Lorraine scramble with Gruyère, peppered bacon, and sprightly scallions. Brunch cocktails, fresh-squeezed juices and smoothies, as well as Julius Meinl coffee cover all the beverage bases.",0,0
1087,Osteria Langhe,Italian,2,"A tapestry-length photograph of the Piemontese countryside is the only nod to tradition in Osteria Langhe's buzzy contemporary space. Lines of glowing bulbs hanging from a sculptural grid bring warmth to bare wood tables and metal chairs. A communal table at the restaurant's entrance, visible through the garage-like glass façade, shines like a beacon of conviviality. Don't spoil your appetite by eating too many of the complimentary house-made black olive grissini before the entrées arrive. Regional specialties abound on the menu: rich, eggy strands of tajarin swirl around braised beef ragù or simple butter and sage. Use delicate crêpe-like crespella, filled with a variety of seasonal vegetables, to sop up spicy leek fonduta.",0,0
1088,Wood,Contemporary,2,"The décor at this Boystown spot might be all grown-up with rich wood tones set against pale tufted booths and a glossy cream bar, but witty winks to the gay community pop up throughout the menu. Cocktails like a ""manhandled sour"" are as suggestively named as they are superbly prepared. Heck, even Sunday brunch is titled ""Morning Wood."" That said, the menu is incredibly refined. Choose from seasonal American food like roasted venison with creamed spinach as well as homemade sausage and spaetzle. Or opt for the country ham flatbread topped with creamy raclette and charred black kale, presented in squares for easy sharing. The bar continues to pour long after the kitchen closes, so night owls sample from the ""Backwoods"" menu of Belgian frites and sauces.",0,0
1089,Bakin' & Eggs,American,1,"A pastry case chockablock with cupcakes, cookies, and brownies entices passersby into this relaxed Lincoln Avenue breakfast and lunch hangout. Inside, whitewashed repurposed church pews provide ample seating for both big families as well as solo hipsters who can be seeen sipping on Intelligentsia coffee, which is on hand for a pick-me-up. As the sibling of Wicker Park's Lovely Bake Shop, it's no wonder the moist, generously frosted cupcakes take the cake. Flavors like pumpkin spice, peanut butter and jelly, and red velvet make it hard to pick a favorite. Latin influences on the savory menu mean carb-loaded and dense chilaquiles with avocado and tomatillos. A kids' menu offers mini breakfast burritos or buttermilk pancakes with whipped cream smiles.",0,0
1090,Milt's Barbecue for the Perplexed,Barbecue,1,"The full name of this kosher spot is Milt's Barbecue for the Perplexed, but even without pork (or dairy) on the menu, there's no sign of ""confusion"" among patrons, as the catalog of smoky barbecue and Jewish deli delights are bound to appease one and all. Additionally, 100% of their profits go to charity, so get in here and get your craving on. The room is simple, with dark wood furnishings and floors, but the kitchen is all sparkle. Tender chopped brisket on a toasted hamburger bun arrives with a trio of barbecue sauces-mustardy Carolina, smoky Memphis, and sweet Kansas City-and fries in a wire fryer basket; while pulled smoked chicken makes its way into the homemade soup. Don't expect to take your Friday night date here as Milt closes at sundown out of respect for the Sabbath.",0,0
1091,P.S. Bangkok,Thai,1,"Even first-timers are part of the family at P.S. Bangkok, a charming Lakeview retreat run by a trio of sisters. Wind chimes ring softly as Sue (who runs the front of the house) graciously welcomes each guest. Linen-draped tables, wooden arches, and bamboo accents lend subtle elegance to the space. Diners do double takes at intriguingly titled dishes that depart from the usual Thai menu. ""Love me tender"" duck is a sweetheart of a meal, featuring fanned duck breast slices with crackling, sugary skin in a citrus-tinged sauce. ""Beef paradise"" is marinated in garlic and spices, and served with Thai barbecue dipping sauce. Stir-fried entrées named for flavor profiles like pungent, tangy, or peppery let guests cater to their own taste buds.",0,0
1092,Parson's Chicken & Fish,American,2,"For the young professionals and new families of gentrifying Logan Square, Parson's Chicken & Fish is a lively but low-key hangout that hits all the bases. It's equally appropriate for a midday snack with the kids or late-night munchies run, and the stay-and-play vibe extends to on-site activities like a winter ice skating rink or summer ping pong tables. As per the name, poultry and piscine offerings are house specialties, with signature golden-fried chicken (and equally popular Negroni slushies) on many tables. An aïoli-smeared brioche bun holds a piping-hot fillet of beer-battered fish topped with crisp slaw and house hot sauce. Dessert isn't made in house, but no matter; neighboring Bang Bang Pie Shop provides daily slices of sweetness.",0,0
1093,Home Bistro,American,2,"Home dishes up loads of charm with a healthy dash of humor in the heart of Boystown. Flickering tea lights on the closely packed bistro-style tables faintly illuminate cozy orange walls painted with food-related quotes. Chef Victor Morenz's eclectic menu picks up influences from around the globe, but each dish is consistently gratifying. Southern meets south of the border in crisp fried oyster tacos with pickled pepper remoulade. Candied kumquats and olive tapenade contrast pleasantly with buttery seared duck breast, and a dense cube of warm, fudgy chocolate cake placed over a swipe of coconut peanut butter is a decadent finale. Plan for an early evening if you're looking forward to a quiet meal; at peak hours, those orange walls really reverberate.",0,0
1094,Chicago Diner,Vegetarian,1,"""Meat free since '83"" is the slogan at Chicago Diner, where servers have been slinging creative, healthy fare to grateful vegetarians and vegans for decades.

Convincingly crispy seitan buffalo wings cool down the spice factor with vegan ranch dressing; while flautas filled with mashed potato, faux cheese, and jalapeños are served with tons of flavorful fixings so that the meat is not missed at all. With a popular brunch menu, numerous gluten-free choices, and a stronghold on the local vegan scene, you can expect a line. So, get there early or hope for good Karma-and a seat.",0,0
1095,Masada,Middle Eastern,1,"Masada Ramli, the mother of owner Shadi Ramli, is the inspiration of this richly adorned spot bedecked with metal lanterns and colorful glazed tiles. A collection of hamsas at the entrance wards off evil, and the lower level lounge pours a bevy of sprits including cocktails, crafts beers, and arak. Although kebabs and wraps can be ordered, there's nothing commonplace about Masada's home-style cooking. Instead, imagine the likes of lamb's kidney and heart sautéed with onions and oyster mushrooms; or fetit betinjan, crunchy pita cubes and roasted eggplant dressed with tahini, pomegranate molasses, and lemon. A number of vegan options abound and attract, including koshari, a hearty mélange of rice, lentils, and gluten-free pasta, accompanied by spicy tomato sauce and tart pickles.",0,0
1096,Owen & Engine,Gastropub,2,"Owen & Engine's charm extends from its glossy black façade into its warm polished wood interior and all the way to the second-floor dining room that sees action into the wee hours. Brocade wallpaper, gas lights, and studded leather club chairs lend a Victorian feel. A frequently changing draft list always features a few selections pulled from a beer cask (or ""engine""). British-inspired gastropub grub matches the impressive roster of brews and Pimm's cups. Bar nibbles like mustard-glazed soft pretzels with Welsh rarebit for dipping; or peanuts tossed in sriracha, Worcestershire, and brown sugar cater to the snacking sort. Hearty entrées like bangers and mash feature house-made Slagel Family Farm's pork sausage and potatoes smothered in onion gravy.",0,0
1097,Fat Willy's,Barbecue,2,"With piles of hickory and applewood stacked at the entrance and the sweet-spicy aroma of smoke filling the air, Fat Willy's telegraphs an authentic barbecue experience from the outset. Vintage hand mixers decorate one wall, but this isn't a precious farmhouse bakery-the meat is front and center, as indicated by the rolls of paper towels and sheets of Kraft paper laid out over gingham tablecloths. Signature baby back ribs are pink and glistening with fat after a slow smoke, and a duo of house-made barbecue sauces lets diners kick things up as desired. Minced fresh garlic adorns the pulled pork sandwich, with a few shakes of seasoned vinegar for extra oomph. After those savory indulgences, a slice of cool, creamy peanut butter mousse cake is just the ticket.",0,0
1098,The Radler,German,2,"With around 20 suds on tap and more than 95 bottles to sample, The Radler is everything you want a beer hall to be. Though the space is new, it has an old soul: communal benches hearken back to the days of classic Bavarian biergartens, and the enormous Bohemian Export beer mural that commands guests' attention is indigenous to the building-a happy discovery during demolition. A stack of small plates on each table sends the message that everything on the menu is meant for sharing. A German onion pie arrives straight from the oven, topped with shaved asparagus and made-to-order Pilsner soubise. Four types of wurst are available by the link, like Thüringer-served over a bed of spring green peas with authentic marinated cucumber salad and traditional mustard.",0,0
1099,La Encantada,Mexican,1,"Encantada is Spanish for enchanting, and this family-run spot more than lives up to its name. Royal-blue, golden-yellow, and exposed brick walls are hung with gallery-style artwork (most of which is for sale), and contemporary Latin tunes waft through the air. Culinary inspiration begins in the family's hometown, Zacatecas, but pulls from around Mexico with delectable results. Enchiladas rojas, a Zacatecan specialty, are as authentic as one could wish. Two small, salted beef-filled tortillas are draped with earthy salsa rojas for muted chili heat, while avocado and crema fresca bring depth to a rustic chicken tortilla soup. The chewy, caramelized crust on pan-fried plantains is textbook perfect, served with a dollop of cinnamon-laced cream.",0,0
1100,Frasca,Italian,2,"The warmth of the wood-burning brick oven and the list of generously priced wines is enough to entice Lakeview's young professionals into the friendly confines of Frasca. Amidst décor inspired by the restaurant's name (""branch"" in Italian), lively groups and intimate dates sample wine flights and split appetizers like charred Brussels sprouts and cauliflower florets tossed with bacon and briny capers. Chewy pizza crusts blistered from the heat of the oven are laden with market-fresh toppings. The salsiccia adds shaved pickled fennel and delicate, wispy fronds to handfuls of crumbled fennel seed sausage and pools of melted Havarti. Grab extra forks for the moist tiramisù with a generous inch-thick layer of cocoa-dusted mascarpone mousse.",0,0
1101,Southport Grocery,American,1,"Equal parts specialty grocery and upscale diner, this Southport Corridor hot spot draws quite a crowd. Local products and in-house goodies are stocked in the front of the narrow space, while the rear offers comfortable banquettes for a casual sit-down meal. Breakfast is served as long as the sun shines, with options like a freshly baked and buttered English muffin stuffed with ginger-sage sausage, a vibrant orange sunny side-up egg, and sweet pepper jelly. A side of red bliss potatoes sweetens the deal, but if you're really looking for something sugary, the grilled coffee cake is a double-layered cinnamon and cream cheese delight. Craving more of your meal? You're in luck: certain menu items, denoted with an asterisk, are available for purchase up front.",0,0
1102,L' Patron,Mexican,1,"Don't worry-the long line stretching past L'Patron's neon-bright façade isn't cause for concern. Counter service moves quickly at this affordable and popular Diversey Avenue taqueria, as staffers smoothly satiate customers with a concise but tasty array of tortas, tacos, and burritos wrapped in handmade tortillas. The interior décor is just as colorful as the outside, with pulsing Latin music to keep you moving as you munch. Ultra-fresh dishes are cooked to order, like a grilled burrito stuffed with charred poblanos, caramelized onion, and tomatillo-jalapeño salsa. Carne asada tacos arrive packed with grilled, well-seasoned beef; while crisp tortilla chips, still warm from the fryer, are addictive companions for scooping chunky, garlicky guacamole.",0,0
1103,Jam,American,1,"Hiding in plain sight on a residential Logan Square block, Jam remains the sweetheart of brunch-o-philes who won't settle for some greasy spoon. Clean white walls and gray stone tables punctuated by lime green placemats give a gallery-like feel to the space; a friendly welcome and wide-open kitchen keep it homey. Their brunch standards like French toast are nothing short of luxurious: think brioche soaked in vanilla- and malt-spiked custard cooked sous vide to absorb every drop, then caramelized in a sizzling pan and garnished with lime leaf-whipped cream and pineapple compote. Braised beef, tangy tomato crema, and smoked Gouda are rolled into lacy buckwheat crêpes and topped with a sunnyside egg for an elegant take on the breakfast burrito.",0,0
1104,Lula Cafe,American,2,"Despite a gleamingly renovated kitchen, neighborhood darling Lula Cafe remains the same beloved hangout it's always been. No matter what's on the constantly evolving menu, the fresh, seasonal, and always original fare keeps the casual spot slammed with the creative denizens of Logan Square from morning to night. The mouthwatering fixings in Lula's Royale breakfast sandwich change with the seasons and might include thin slices of meaty, tender short rib, a sunny-side up farm egg, smoky cumin aïoli and bitter orange jam served alongside a salad of vinegary carrot, daikon, and cilantro. Sweet teeth are satisfied by a tall wedge of double-layered carrot cake complete with crème anglaise and a luxurious spoonful of strawberry preserves on the side.",0,0
1105,Fat Rice,Asian,2,"Not familiar with the food of Macau? Not to worry-Fat Rice turns the uninitiated into believers nightly. A wooden pergola shelters hardy souls braving the infamous wait for a table. Bar seating around the open kitchen gives a bird's-eye view of the mélange of ingredients used in each dish, though servers are happy to walk any guest through the intoxicating mashup of Portuguese and Asian cuisine. Sharing is recommended for platters like the namesake arroz gordo, a paella-esque blend of meat, shellfish, and pickles. Pillowy bread sops up chunky olive-and-bacalhau spread in a pool of verdant olive oil. Shredded dried pork and fried shallots are intriguing but successful dessert components, when paired with salted caramel, sesame and crispy rice.",0,0
1106,Cochon Volant,French,2,"Though it's attached to the Hyatt, Cochon Volant is quickly entrenching itself as a favorite with Loop locals and sightseers alike for its timeless warmth. Round bistro tables and bentwood chairs are clustered across the mosaic-tiled floor, while a broad, marble-topped bar is bustling with patrons from lunch to happy hour. French brasserie favorites dominate the menu, ranging from rustic French onion soup to lavish raw seafood plateaus. Steak frites are juicy and flavorsome with a tender prime cut of bavette, offered with five sauce options like a classic béarnaise or rich Roquefort. Breakfast is delicious, but for those who don't have time to sit and stay a while, the café and takeaway bakery lets commuters snag a pastry and coffee to go.",0,0
1107,Rosebud Prime,Steakhouse,3,"A member of Chicago's longstanding Rosebud Restaurants, this Loop darling plays the part of a throwback American steakhouse to the hilt. Crimson-hued, faux-alligator chairs and banquettes punctuate a sprawling wood-paneled dining room, where tuxedoed servers weave expertly among suited bankers. A winding staircase leads to a lofty mezzanine. Classic cuts and chops abound, but Rosebud Prime does all of its dishes with panache. Double-cut bone-in lamb chops sport a plump ribbon of fat encircling their delicate, rich centers. Two strips of grilled skirt steak remain juicy and tender, complemented by a pile of caramelized Bermuda onions; and rich beef and veal ragù makes penne Bolognese a lovely surprise, finished with a dollop of fresh ricotta.",0,0
1108,Atwood,Contemporary,2,"This corner restaurant's 19th century façade may be historic, but its soaring dining room is a strikingly modern vision of white marble-topped tables, glossy beveled subway tiles, and low-slung black leather chairs and banquettes. The crimson bar stools fill with patrons meeting for business and pleasure all week, while brunch gets the place buzzing on weekends. Atwood's brasserie menu isn't exactly full of surprises, but its familiar foods are given first-class upgrades-think pancetta-studded mac and cheese; lamb chops with basil and preserved lemon; and an omelet with crunchy bacon, creamy Brie, and verdant asparagus. For a real wake-up call, the Inferno Virgin Mary has more than enough of a kick (plus more of that bacon as a garnish).",0,0
1109,Prime & Provisions,Steakhouse,3,"Though it would also feel at home in Las Vegas, this glitzy oversized steakhouse fits right in with its swanky Chicago riverfront neighbors. The polished, masculine interior makes its priorities clear from the get-go, showcasing a two-story wine tower and a peek into the dry-aging room under bold barrel-vaulted ceilings and chandeliers. A starter of chewy rosemary-sea salt monkey bread whets the palate, while rosy pink slices of slow-roasted bone-in prime rib, rubbed with a crust of fragrant herbs, take a classic hoagie to new heights. When paired with house-cut fries and creamy horseradish dip, it's a meal to rival a Porterhouse, but save room for dessert: a single-serving banana cream pie with loads of whipped cream is a whimsical final bite.",0,0
1110,The Kitchen,American,2,"Panoramic views and eye-popping spaces are par for the course at most of the lofty spots abutting the Chicago River, but The Kitchen's farm-to-table food manages to steer the focus back to the plate. The restaurant's approachable, community-minded take on straightforward seasonal food-along with its impressive drinks program-makes it easy to please. Even if you're not attending a Monday ""Community Night"" dinner alongside many of the purveyors whose ingredients appear on the plate, you'll find a fresh, flavorful mix of dishes. Crushed white bean bruschetta is topped with a sprightly herb and frisée salad, which is in turn dressed with a blood orange vinaigrette. And wild Bristol Bay salmon is poached with care, its silkiness punctuated by garlic-chive aïoli.",0,0
1111,Chicago Cut,Steakhouse,3,"Chicago Cut is a steakhouse perfectly suited for the City of the Big Shoulders. The finely tailored locale bustles day and night, thanks to being wrapped in windows along the riverfront, sumptuous red leather furnishings, warm wood trim, and a crackerjack service team cementing its steakhouse vibe. Non-meat entrées include cedar-planked salmon with a sriracha-honey glaze, but make no mistake: beef is boss here. Prime steaks, butchered and dry-aged in-house for 35 days, get just the right amount of time under the flame, as is the case with the perfectly cooked-to-order Porterhouse-pre-sliced and plated for each guest. Sides are a must and should include the dome of hashbrowns, creamed spinach redolent of nutmeg, or tender stalks of grilled asparagus.",0,0
1112,Remington's,American,2,"This shiny gem arrives courtesy of the 4 Star Restaurant Group behind Crosby's Kitchen, Dunlay's, and Frasca. Guests can choose from a few great seating options in the enormous space: a table by the large windows up front, thrown open on temperate days for people-watching; the U-shaped bar, chockablock with televisions airing the latest games; or the intimate, glassed-in dining room lined with wine bottles at the back. The restaurant features an elevated roster of American classics including steaks, rotisserie chicken and seafood-not to mention a raw bar with Kansai-style box-pressed sushi. It's hard to go wrong here, but don't miss the No. 8 Tuna, which is a ruby-red slice of ahi wrapped in crispy nori and tempura, then paired with kimchi-studded rice.",0,0
1113,Untitled Supper Club,Contemporary,2,"An unmarked entrance leads the way to this sultry subterranean lair, its various rooms pumping out music and serving up handcrafted cocktails to a young, sexy clientele lounging in tufted leather banquettes. Lights are nice and sultry; tables are low-slung and casual; and there are no less than 507 whiskeys to choose from. A charcuterie board may offer up silky duck rillettes, shot through with foie gras; textured and spreadable liverwurst; as well as thin slices of prosciutto and coppa accompanied by a house-made mostarda. Overstuffed squash blossom rellenos are filled with creamy ricotta and served over Agave-spiked corn relish and chili-lime crema. Don't miss the scrumptious meatloaf sandwich, slathered with Korean-style ketchup, and laced with rosemary-infused aïoli.",0,0
1114,The Gage,Gastropub,2,"For 10 years, this expansive, eclectic gastropub has catered to the Millennium Park crowds. Handsome banquettes and columns wrapped in celadon tiles lend a clubby allure, but the space's buzzy vibe never feels overwhelming. While a bar stretching half the length of the restaurant gets its fair share of happy-hour crowds, the rear dining rooms offer a more relaxed setting. Pub classics with flair define the menu, like malt-battered cod with creamy tartar sauce and parsley-dusted thick-cut fries-a solid rendition of fish and chips. Keep it light with crunchy watercress and sugar snap pea salad with house-made burrata, or go all out with a plate of chocolate-toffee cream puffs garnished with tender cocoa-dusted marshmallows.",0,0
1115,RPM Steak,Steakhouse,4,"RPM Steak shares the same sleek, moneyed vibe as still-happening RPM Italian, its sister restaurant located just around the corner. Polished black, white, and wood décor speaks to the finer things in life, with a menu of succulent steaks, raw bar offerings, and sides to back it up. For the best people-watching, score one of the semicircular booths edging the room. A massive single tiger prawn, served simply on ice with lemon, is a tasty, visually stunning starter. Steaks range from petite filets to dry-aged 24-ounce cowboy cuts with a list of big reds to match. Highlights include the classic, deeply satisfying steak frites, tender and pink inside, charred outside, and complemented by truffle béarnaise for the meat and Caesar dip for the fries.",0,0
1116,Acanto,Italian,2,"Overseen by Billy Lawless, this Italian reincarnation set in the former Henri space knows how to make an impression: its prime location across from Millennium Park would be a looker any day, but it goes the extra mile with style and sociability. The dining room is striking with angular light fixtures and orange banquettes; a luminous marble bar and matching tables lend a masculine, sophisticated vibe. The carte's Italian standards are amped up to luxurious levels, like the Treviso and white bean salad with fennel, golden raisins, and crispy pancetta; or house-made duck egg spaghetti drenched in cream sauce and twirled around rapini, spicy pork sausage, and caramelized onions. For dessert, a fresh ricotta tart is highlighted by bittersweet orange marmalade.",0,0
1117,Siena Tavern,Italian,2,"Chef Fabio Viviani's TV-ready Italian charisma extends to every corner of this huge, lively restaurant. A mixture of funky décor elements-like cascading plants ""growing"" from filing cabinets on walls-somehow manage to work in incongruous harmony with sexy black marble and stainless steel throughout the multilevel space. Various bars offer pizza, crudo, fresh mozzarella, and house-made pasta, though even globally influenced dishes have a Mediterranean touch. The Tavern burger accompanied by parmesan-dusted fries is stacked with melted Taleggio, crispy speck, and garlic aïoli. Order the lush, creamy tiramisù for dessert, which gets a crunch from chopped nuts and crisp homemade meringues, and you'll be tempted to lick the bottom of the zinc tin.",0,0
1118,Bavette's Bar & Boeuf,American,3,"Restaurateur Brendan Sokoloff (also of Maude's Liquor Bar and Au Cheval) breathes new life into the tried-and-true steakhouse concept with this swanky destination. The vibe inside may be dark and loud, but that only adds to the bonhomie of the chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures, and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas. Predictably, steakhouse and raw bar standards dominate the menu. Most steaks are wet-aged, and though some may prefer more funk, the cuts are expertly broiled. The kitchen deserves praise for unexpected options like creamy short rib stroganoff featuring hand-cut pasta; buttermilk fried chicken; and sides such as elote-style corn in a rich cheese sauce sparked with lime.",0,0
1119,Tortoise Club,American,3,"Every city needs a restaurant with the word ""club"" in the title-somewhere reassuringly old-school where you'd take your future father-in-law if you want to marry his daughter. Tortoise Club fits the bill perfectly. If it was just a few years older, it would be called an institution because it also harks back to more dissolute times; order a Negroni at lunchtime here and no one will bat an eyelid. The place has an unapologetically masculine look thanks to the mahogany paneling and dark leather seating. It has a lounge bar with nightly live jazz and a familiar menu of American classics, from big plates of seafood to great steaks. Where it differs from many similar spots is that here the service is sprightly and sincere and the welcome is warm.",0,0
1120,Gilt Bar,Gastropub,2,"In the shadow of Merchandise Mart, it's not easy to miss the revolving door entrance to Gilt Bar, a moody and imposing River North favorite. The bar up front mixes cocktails to a metronomic rhythm, while the back is more intimate with brick walls, studded leather banquettes, and nostalgic lighting. However make no mistake: this is no Bugsy Malone speakeasy, but a grown-up version for bar-flies with astute palates. Snack on creamy burrata and shaved ham finished with a swig of extra virgin olive oil before savoring tender, flavorful pork meatballs on a bed of wilted kale with romesco and almond gremolata. In the end, gorge on an unctuous brown butter-apple cake with salted caramel and vanilla ice cream-perhaps to the dulcet tunes of Bob Dylan. Bliss.",0,0
1121,Travelle,Mediterranean,3,"This contemporary Mediterranean dining room shares its home-a landmark Mies van der Rohe tower completed in 1972-with The Langham hotel. Floor-to-ceiling windows on the second floor space offer views of Marina City, but with its stunning kitchen displayed behind gradient glass panels, the scene inside is equally dramatic. Creative add-ins bring flair and flavor to flawlessly executed and gorgeously composed dishes. A perfect, toothsome champagne risotto is enlivened by juicy, barely pickled grapes and toasted Marcona almonds, while a thick, creamy tranche of seared salmon rests on ""healthy"" fried green farro, finished with a tangy drizzle of spicy soy-mustard. Raspberry coulis and meringue shards are an ideal garnish for a fresh and zesty citrus tart.",0,0
1122,C Chicago,Seafood,3,"This spacious looker lands in River North courtesy of the team behind the popular Chicago Cut Steakhouse. At C Chicago, the focus is on fresh-make that really fresh-seafood. This is exciting news: there aren't many seafood restaurants in Chicago, and the few that exist aren't doing it like the talented Chef Bill Montagne, who hails from the piscine temple, Le Bernardin. Kick things off with a beautiful scallop carpaccio kissed with olive oil, lemon juice, basil, chives and Espelette pepper. Then nibble on an irresistibly chewy farro salad, served warm, tossed with charred corn, mustard greens, and topped with whipped feta. The baked Aleutian cod, arriving in a perfectly subtle Basquaise sauce and dotted with squid ink and red wine vinaigrette is sublime.",0,0
1123,Celeste,Contemporary,3,"Celeste celebrates the city's close relationship with that great American institution-the bar. It is a veritable fun palace evoking the great drinking establishments of the last century and is spread over three floors. On the first floor is a bar with an abbreviated menu. On the second floor is the narrow and nominally named Deco Room where the marble-topped tables face another bar; and upstairs is reserved for private parties. The food is certainly more than a mere addendum to the terrific cocktail list and the kitchen is clearly a skilled one. Dishes are quite elaborate in their construction-order lamb and you may find it includes the loin, belly and sweetbreads- and they are as flavorsome as they are attractive.",0,0
1124,Slurping Turtle,Japanese,2,"Both turtles and noodles symbolize longevity, so a meal at Slurping Turtle should add a few years to your life (and warmth to your belly). Inside the minimalist bento box of a space, diners sit elbow-to-elbow at sleek white communal tables. Boutique Japanese beverages like Hitachino Nest beer and Ramuné bubble-gum soda bring smiles to patrons in the know. Along with deep, steaming bowls of ramen and udon, the lengthy menu serves small plates, sushi, and other Japanese comfort food for snacking and sharing. Tender ribeye and chicken skewers arrive moist and glistening, straight from the binchotan charcoal grill. Deep-fried Brussels sprouts are crispy outside and tender inside without a hint of grease, topped with sliced scallions and fried shallots.",0,0
1125,Paris Club,French,2,"Some of Paris Club was commandeered to create a ramen spot next door, but in return for this munificence, it got a first-rate makeover. Dressed in red leather seats, wood panelling and globe lighting, it perfectly captures the look of a traditional Parisian brasserie. The only thing missing is insouciant service and someone with a dog on their lap. The menu is unapologetically Gallic, ""Le Prime Steakburger"" notwithstanding, and all the classics are present: from fruits de mer to steak frites and baba au rhum. The pommes purée is so wonderfully buttery you'll need a defibrillator on standby. The wine list is all French too. On the second floor find Studio Paris, a proper nightclub with bottle service and celebrity DJ appearances.",0,0
1126,Ramen-san,Asian,1,"Lettuce Entertain You brings you bowlfuls of ingredient-driven noodle soups served up right next door to the restaurant group's Paris Club. The menu at this Asian concept revolves around a handful of tastefully crafted broths dancing with thin, wavy noodles produced by Sun Noodle. The tonkotsu ramen is a traditional pleasure afloat with sweet slices of chashu, wakame, and molten egg. Meanwhile, the smoked brisket ramen is a novel departure defined by a black garlic-enriched chicken broth and slices of Bub City's 18-hour brisket. Ramen-san's loyal following is comprised of hipsters and suits alike, and they all seem to dig the salvaged look and booming playlist. Night owls take note: Japanese whiskies rule the bar and fried rice is served late into the night.",0,0
1127,Sixteen,Contemporary,4,"This bold setting puts the Chicago River, Tribune and Wrigley buildings at your fingertips from the sixteenth floor of the Trump Hotel. The lobby entrance is as unremarkable as the dining room is dramatic, centered around an enormous Swarovski chandelier that hangs like an inverted wedding cake over a curving wall of African rosewood. Beyond this lies a kitchen that takes itself very seriously, but that's ok. Chef Thomas Lents' cuisine is extraordinary, accomplished, and even more of a draw than the décor. Meals here are very conceptual and include head-spinning affairs that articulate a theme, like the ""Faces of Sixteen"" as an homage to inspirations and employees. This may translate as a tribute to Joël Robuchon through a pot of wonderfully smooth, raw and seasoned langoustine artfully topped with gelée and sea buckthorn. Another theme ""Food in Progress, Modern Fine Dining: Moving Forward with Respect to the Past"" ponders the emergence of the Nordic through a gently smoked oyster, flavorful potato gelée, horseradish, and caraway. Grilled lobster with uni, coffee, and rice is downright unforgettable. Desserts like lemon tart with diplomat cream and fennel are as innovative as they are delicious.",2,1
1128,Hubbard Inn,Mediterranean,2,"Handsome from head-to-toe, the Hubbard Inn takes the idea of a classic tavern and dresses it to the nines. Brass-clad globe lights glow above lacquered plank tables in the front bar room, leading to tufted leather couches and fireplaces in the book-lined and Hogwarts-worthy library. The second floor is low-slung and loungy. A wall-sized chalkboard behind the marble bar whets whistles with descriptions of house cocktails. Shareable farm-to-table dishes appeal to nearly every appetite. Kale salad, that ubiquitous menu staple, gets a new twist when tossed with pickled blackberries, candied walnuts, and grated ricotta salata. And, a quartet of juicy, beautifully cooked lamb chops over rustic chickpea purée is brightened by a handful of chopped olives and mint.",0,0
1129,Bub City,Barbecue,2,"Bub City isn't as far south as Nashville or Memphis, but the country music vibe comes through just the same at this barbecue- and booze-focused hang. Two bars flank the main stage that hosts nightly live entertainment. One bar is a shrine to over 100 varieties of whiskey, and the other to beer-easily identified by the American flag made from empty cans stacked behind its counter. Along with the extensive lineup of traditional smoked brisket, ribs, and fried chicken, a raw bar brings chilled seafood refreshment before spicy cheese-stuffed Texas Torpedoes and loaded hot link sandwiches. A bowl of Smokie's chili arrives with a kick from sliced jalapeño, but the caddy of barbecue and hot sauces on each table lets heat fiends intensify the seasoning.",0,0
1130,Everest,French,4,"Summit the historic Chicago Stock Exchange building via a private elevator to reach the sophisticated-though not outdated-scene at Everest on the 40th floor. The sunken-level dining room stays dimly lit by contemporary circular metal light fixtures, all the better to gaze admiringly at the views from the windows framing the formal space. Heavy white linens and abstract bronze sculptures adorn each table, at which smartly-dressed guests take it all in. Alsatian chef Jean Joho keeps to the French tradition on his degustation and prix-fixe menus, with nods to local ingredients among the classical techniques and pairings presented nightly. Where other chefs may feel the need to update and tweak time-honored dishes, Everest celebrates its classics. Subtle hints of ginger in a rich Gewürztraminer butter sauce complement succulent chunks of fresh Maine lobster. Two thick, bone-in lamb chops, ringed elegantly with flavorful fat, are tender but never too chewy, their richness amplified by delicate, silken spring garlic flan and a bed of crisp green beans that soak up the thyme jus. Cap it all off with tart and sweet pistachio vanilla succès dabbed with ruddy rhubarb jam.",1,1
1131,Bottlefork,Contemporary,2,"Bottlefork, Forkbottle-yup, we get it, it's a ""bar & kitchen"" but, in this case, a very good one. The narrow room is dominated by a 40-foot bar which morphs into an open kitchen. The lights are turned down and the music is turned up-and unless they know Big Audio Dynamite, it's not music for kids. When it comes to the food, ""locally sourced and globally inspired"" is their USP with the chef, a Four Seasons alumnus, making much of his largely European peregrinations. Expect punchy flavors, teasing combinations, clever twists, and everything from salumi and tuna crudo in a jar to ""popcorn"" sweetbreads, pastas, and Moroccan stews. The terrific cocktail and drinks list covers all bases too. And who isn't tempted to take dessert in liquid form?",0,0
1132,Topolobampo,Mexican,4,"This jewel in Bayless' culinary crown welcomes a rush of serious eaters and canoodlers for original south-of-the-border fare-with an upscale twist. While it may share an entrance and bar with sibling, Frontera Grill, that is where the likeness ends. Walk past a sliding door to enter this elegant, terra cotta-lined dining room, which feels worlds away from the fiesta upfront. Lunch is notably laid-back, but chatty, over-eager servers turn dinner into a more exhaustive experience. Enduring their descriptive chalk talk may feel a bit like sitting through a college lecture for some, but be patient as you will be rewarded with exceptional food boasting a panoply of flavors, colors, and textures. A trio of ceviches highlighting albacore, tomato, and olive; Yucatecan shrimp and calamari; and tuna coctel make for divine starters. And, the sopa seca de fideos, tossed in a saucy tomato-morita broth and fortified by chorizo, crema, and Brussels sprouts, is perhaps the best in the country. Desserts are flagrantly inventive and the strongest element of this epicurean show. A torta de elote or warm corn cake with golden corn ice cream, cherry preserves, and salty caramel corn is absolutey fantastic.",1,1
1133,Coco Pazzo,Italian,2,"Vibrant blue-and-orange awnings help Coco Pazzo make its mark among the area's stellar restaurants, though their reputation for seasonal Tuscan cuisine has been going strong since 1992. Navy velvet curtains that hang in the wide, welcoming, high-ceilinged room may dampen the din, but not the enthusiasm from regulars ready for a delicious mid-day tavolata and bottle from the all-Italian wine list. Business types fill every seat for the piatti unici, a chef-chosen lunch special that changes daily but is always made with expert care. Selections may include Rushing Rivers trout over lentils and spinach paired with speck- and mushroom-studded risotto made with Carnaroli rice. Dinner options like pancetta-wrapped quail with taleggio fondue showcase the kitchen's ambitious side.",0,0
1134,Frontera Grill,Mexican,2,"The linchpin in Rick Bayless' empire, Frontera Grill is decidedly unique in its homage to regional Mexican cuisine and displays a near cult-like devotion to local product. The service at this dining room, psychedelic in its color scheme, can verge on vapid, but find a seat on the bar side for a warmer (and worthier) experience. The ever-changing menu is cohesive with a mix of classics and specialties like sopa azteca, a nourishing pasilla chile broth poured atop crisp tortilla strips, cool avocado, grilled chicken, and jack cheese. A version of the classic from Morelia, enchiladas a la plaza are first flash-fried, then folded over seasoned cabbage, potatoes, and carrots. Pair this plate with a side of spinach in green chile and you won't be unhappy. Ever.",0,0
1135,Embeya,Fusion,2,"Floor-to-ceiling windows put Embeya's industrial interior on display, letting passersby soak up its intriguing sculptural elements and Asian-inspired decor. Inside, blown-glass bouquets of light fixtures hang above communal tables, and wooden screens in intricate cutout patterns divide the lofty, airy dining room and open kitchen, where Chef Mike Sheerin and his team whip up enticing Pan-Asian fare. The affordable lunch menu features dishes like carrot salad with shaved country ham, an assertively spicy togarashi dressing, and a swipe of yuzu curd; or udon in a thickened broth with diced tofu and seasonal vegetables. Dinner entrées display more ambition, as in poached halibut with coconut, hearts of palm, and mint fumet.",0,0
1136,Sepia,American,3,"When a restaurant's excellence is this consistent, it should come as no surprise that the First Lady names it as one of her favorites. Set inside a 19th century print shop, the historic dining room does a fine job mixing original details with modern touches. Muted tones in the exposed brick walls and custom tile flooring complement newer elements like floor-to-ceiling wine storage and dramatic smoke-shaded chandeliers that drip with crystals. Though the décor may tip its hat to yesteryear, Chef Andrew Zimmerman's cuisine is firmly grounded in the 21st century. Whether you visit for lunch or dinner, meals here always seem to reflect the amalgam of American cuisine, with hints of Southeast Asian, Korean, and Mediterranean tastes. Potato gnocchi may seem commonplace, but this version is memorable thanks to the flawless components and rich, profound flavors of lamb sugo with crunchy bits of ciabatta breadcrumbs. Chicken here is downright exciting, served tender and crisp-skinned with a supremely buttery Albufera sauce, crumbly chestnuts, caramelized fennel, and sausage. Simple-sounding desserts keep the bar high, with offerings like toffee-coconut cake with chocolate ganache and burnt caramel.",1,1
1137,Roka Akor,Asian,3,"There's no shortage of flash at Roka Akor, the local offshoot of a London-based-via-Scottsdale Japanese steakhouse and sushi temple. The massive LED-illuminated glass hood of the showstopping robata station grabs attention in the center of the vast space, with a brigade of black-clad line cooks working the flames. For a front row seat of the action, sit at the surrounding counter topped with charred shou-sugi-ban wood. With such a prominent display, guests would be remiss not to try choices from the robata. Lightly blackened lamb chops in a sweet-and-spicy glaze are tender, smoky, and ready for dipping in crimson Korean chili sauce. A starter of plump Wagyu and kimchi dumplings nearly bursting with spicy, rich beef expertly toe the line between crispy and moist.",0,0
1138,Vermilion,Indian,2,"Andy Warhol would feel right at home among these silver-painted brick walls, high-fashion black-and-white photographs, metallic chairs, and curtains. The cool lounge atmosphere is best for dressed-up evenings or a celebratory Latin-tinged cocktail at the bar. Two expansive menus-one vegetarian, the other carnivorous-encompass Indian-inspired tapas and street foods. If feeling overhelmed by the choices, stick to the chef's specialties or go for the prix-fixe and let the kitchen decide. Meaty delicacies include spice-rubbed Mysore lamb chops with pink pickled onions. Gobi Portuguese lets tart tomatillo chutney and crunchy eggplant offset sweet coconut gravy and tender cauliflower. Shahi tukra pleases the palate with crisp fried semolina cakes drenched in caramel sauce.",0,0
1139,Sunda,Fusion,2,"The Sunda shelf, an underwater outcropping that stretches along the coastline of Southeast Asia, connects the countries that provide culinary inspiration for this enormous River North lounge and restaurant. The beautiful people are naturally attracted to the clubby vibe Sunda radiates, complete with thumping music and a wide range of cocktail and sake selections. The seafood is as fresh as the vibe is sultry, with numerous raw and cooked options like tempura rock shrimp tossed with candied walnuts in a creamy honey aïoli; or maki like the ""tail of two tunas"" pairing yellowfin and super white tuna with pickled jalapeños and fried shallots. Meat-eaters won't go hungry with creative plates like lemongrass beef lollipops and oxtail potstickers.",0,0
1140,NAHA,American,3,"There's a quiet elegance to Chef Carrie Nahabedian's dining room, a sleek, window-wrapped space with contemporary accents of concrete, wood, and greenery. Here, patrons aren't groupies checking off the latest table on their do list, but rather connoisseurs experiencing a magnificent meal with exceptional service. If your idea of relaxation starts with pre-dinner drinks, the sizable bar and smattering of tables in the front lounge are an open invitation to begin. Despite its understated environs, NAHA's sweeping carte of seasonally driven Mediterranean cuisine is anything but. Shining starters include succulent lamb boereg, a delicate phyllo-wrapped parcel of ground meat plated with strained yogurt, juicy red pomegranate arils, and refreshing watercress salad. Perfectly toothsome and loaded with seasonal produce, the risotto is always a hit, while entrées like pan-seared Arctic char dressed with beluga lentils, mustard seeds, and savory apple-celery broth are a breath of fresh air. Dessert highlights include the house sundae-a perennial favorite that's reimagined each season-and the gâteau Basque, a warm vanilla custard cake served with brown butter ice cream, corn pudding, and cubed pears.",1,1
1141,RPM,Italian,2,"You'll want to bust out the Dolce & Gabbana for a sultry night at RPM. This see-and-be-seen scene starts at the wraparound Carrara marble bar and works its way to the mod black-and-white dining room, where sexy white leather chairs and booths don't detract from the pretty people on display. Even servers get into the spirit with white coats and skinny black ties. If you can tune out the diversions, the poster-sized menu of modern Italian antipasti, snacks, and family-style plates won't disappoint. Classically prepared peppered beef carpaccio and shaved parmesan is garnished with crispy mushrooms, while a hearty entrée of gnocchi is tossed with mild Italian sausage and rapini. Save room to share a plate of freshly fried bomboloni oozing with Nutella.",0,0
1142,Saigon Sisters,Vietnamese,1,"The sign of a great restaurant is when the owner is on-site, and such is the case at this local hot spot, where Mary Nguyen Aregoni is as gregarious and welcoming as her staff. Named after Mary and sister, Theresa Nguyen, the lofty space belies its compact size with huge glass windows and high ceilings. Simple banquettes and wood tables are a perfect canvas for the vibrant Vietnamese cuisine that comes speeding out of the kitchen. Lunch is busy with business types ordering the likes of a fragrant, satisfying, and clear pho floating with soft noodles, bean sprouts, jalapeños, and cilantro. Meanwhile, noodles stir-fried with thinly sliced hoisin-glazed pork, char-grilled red pepper, and sliced avocado are a dream team of flavor and texture.",0,0
1143,Gene & Georgetti,Steakhouse,4,"No, it's not a Hollywood set. This Italian-American steak joint is the real thing, and those wiseguys at the bar have been clinking their ice cubes in this wood-paneled room for decades. The historic spot, founded in 1941, is boisterous downstairs with the aforementioned regulars and guys grabbing a bite; upstairs is more refined for local politico lunches and a bit of old-school romance at dinner. Gene & Georgetti is a steakhouse with an Italian bloodline, prominently displayed in the heaping helping of fried peperoncini and bell peppers with the signature ""chicken alla Joe."" The cottage fries (oversized potato planks that come with most entrées) might necessitate a doggie bag, but all the better to leave room for a slice of classic carrot cake.",0,0
1144,Terzo Piano,Italian,3,"Whether you're taking in the modern masterpieces at the Art Institute or simply enjoying lunch or cocktails on the sculpture-filled garden terrace, Terzo Piano is a feast for all the senses. The windowed white room is mod and minimalist, allowing the artistry of the Mediterranean-influenced menu to shine brightly at each table. With Tony Mantuano overseeing the kitchen, Italian influences find their way into many seasonal dishes. Charred tomato crème fraîche lends luxurious smokiness and a tart streak to tender chicken Milanese resting on roasted cipollini purée; and agnolotti bursting with a sweet pea-ricotta filling find savory balance with shards of crispy pancetta. As an added bonus, museum members receive a 10 percent discount on the meal.",0,0
1145,Bohemian House,Eastern European,2,"This wickedly stylish ""house"" is exactly what River North needed to shake it up-a truly unique restaurant serving up delicious Czech, Austrian, and Hungarian cuisines. The stunning beer hall-meets-art nouveau interior (think reclaimed wood beams, stunning tiles arching over a semi-open kitchen, sky-blue tufted leather couches and Persian rugs) is worth a visit alone. No detail is overlooked. Delightfully, the food is amazingly tasty and just as pretty to look at. Don't miss the open-faced schnitzel sandwich, highlighting juicy pork over apple and kohlrabi slaw, aged Gouda, a fried egg, and drizzle of coarse mustard. Also a must do? The warm blueberry kolacky, a traditional Czech cookie filled with blueberry coulis and served with lemon curd and blueberry-sour cream ice cream.",0,0
1146,Avec,Mediterranean,2,"Fans have been clamoring for the dinner plates at this West Randolph mainstay for more than a decade-and now that lunch is on the menu, it's official: Avec is a non-stop hangout. It's a fun vibe, as diners are tightly packed at a long counter and communal seating in the chic wood plank encased room, and servers do a good job attending to the crowd. Mediterranean flavors factor prominently in the kitchen's stimulating creations, like a kale and carrot salad dressed with delightfully herbaceous and spicy green harissa as well as sunflower seeds for crunch. A thick slice of excellent whole grain bread spread with walnut-beet muhamarra is the foundation of an open-faced roasted salmon sandwich, and other delights-there are many-come and go with the seasons.",0,0
1147,Beatrix,International,2,"From a spartan façade to an industrial décor, Beatrix is the epitome of cool. Then consider its many meal options, popular tunes, and trendy scene rife with hotel guests from the adjacent Aloft, and know why it's jamming. Servers don stylish hairdos and tattoos to match the vibe while attending to the giant room scattered with seats and a coffee bar dispensing excellent local brews. Meanwhile, the menu veers from creative to quirky with pleasing results. A spring pea soup highlights aroma, flavor, and texture when shot with mint, ricotta, and croutons. Salads may headline, but mains like roasted chili- and chocolate-glazed salmon are a smoky surprise. End with the apple strudel flavored with caramelized brown sugar-it's big in size and faultless in flavor.",0,0
1148,Benny's Chop House,Steakhouse,3,"Old-school service meets modern elegance at Benny's Chop House. A far cry from the clubby, masculine steakhouses of yesteryear and just a stone's throw from the Magnificent Mile, this expansive but welcoming space goes for understated glamour, with tasteful inlaid wood and burgundy columns offset by natural stone walls, white birch branches, and a marble bar. Though Benny's steaks are the draw, those prime cuts of filet mignon and ribeye are matched by fresh seafood like simply roasted bone-in halibut fillet and classic raw bar towers, along with a variety of pastas and salads. A trio of sliders featuring mini portions of Benny's burger, crab cake, and sliced filet with horseradish cream elevate the idea of bar snacks to new heights.",0,0
1149,Blackbird,Contemporary,3,"The bright, very contemporary boxy white façade is a brilliant contrast to its somewhat missable street-just as it has been since its 1997 opening. Inside the white and steel space, find clean lines and a modern aesthetic that moves from the black-and-white artwork to the bare tables and vases that seem to pop with colorful flowers. Service can be brusque, but that never seems to deter the crowds from packing in. Expect a wait. A strong sense of style extends to the cuisine; this is a serious kitchen with an eye on artistic detail and elegance. The à la carte menu may offer dishes like duck rillettes spread on a sunflower seed cracker studded with poppy, raw sesame, and pumpkin seeds as well as compressed apple for a tart counterpoint to the rich duck. Meaty abalone mushroom confit is served with tiny and delicate sweet potato tortellini, braised mustard greens, and green apple in a soy-kissed broth. Finish on a sweet note with the Bourbon gooey butter cake, inventively deconstructed and served with crushed and shatter-thin sheets of caramelized strudel, toasted pecans, and a delectable whoosh of wonderfully seasonal pumpkin pie filling, all topped with whipped goat cheese.",1,1
1150,Mastro's,Steakhouse,4,"Mastro's may be relatively young on the Windy City's steakhouse scene, but it shows up with the swagger of an old pro. Black SUVs unload VIPs in front of the revolving door, which leads to a gleaming wall of bottles at the gilded bar. Live lounge music may take the level of conversation up a notch, but sip on a shaken martini to blank out the surrounding din. Steaks on screaming hot platters come unadorned unless otherwise listed, and servers will happily rattle off recommendations for toppings, sauces, and crusts. Salads like Mastro's house version, a local favorite stocked with chopped jumbo shrimp and a giant steamed prawn, are hearty (read: oversized), but smaller portions are on offer so you can leave room for the renowned butter cake.",0,0
1151,Salero,Spanish,2,"Nestled in among neighboring Randolph Street hangouts, this upscale newbie holds its own. Accented by wood details set aglow with pillar candles and a turquoise wall hung with steer horns, the space boasts a chic front bar area for cocktails and a dining room that welcomes guests in for a meal . A contemporary vision of Spanish cuisine turns out pintxos to start-try the Gilda, a single bite skewer featuring a brown anchovy, pickled guindilla pepper, and a manzanilla olive. Follow this up with a slick risotto-paella hybrid; or boneless roasted quail stuffed with chorizo and set over wilted spinach with toasted pine nuts. For dessert, order the manzana to receive a miniature apple cake dressed with rosemary crumble, cider reduction, and goat cheese ice cream.",0,0
1152,Sable Kitchen & Bar,American,2,"Tucked into the spacious and beautiful Hotel Palomar, Sable Kitchen & Bar is a sleek, sultry, and sophisticated number, fitted out with different dining areas. There's the stunning 40-foot bar, tricked out in gorgeous dark paneling, soft leather seats, and unique light fixtures. The expansive dining room is equally elegant and urbane, attracting dates looking for more intimacy or friends catching up over dinner.The chef manning the ship here is Lawrence Letrero, and an evening in his very capable hands might entail a decadently spicy and wonderfully complex starter of shrimp and roasted squash curry. Then diners may graduate to crispy, juicy adobo pork belly, served with sticky rice, and a pickled green papaya salad topped with a fried farm egg.",0,0
1153,GT Fish & Oyster,Seafood,2,"Quaint seaside shacks have nothing on this urban spot that exudes nautical chic. A boomerang-shaped communal table by the raw bar makes a perfect oyster-slurping perch. Lead fishing weights keep napkins in place on nautically styled, brass-edged tables, lined up under an enormous chalkboard-style mural of a jaunty swordfish skeleton. Pescatarians savor the numerous seafood dishes meant for sharing, but those who forego fish are limited to three meat options. Rectangular crab cakes, stuffed to the gills with sweet meat, get a crunchy sear on all sides. Salade Niçoise spotlights pristine slices of fresh tuna and snappy green beans in a cider-mustard dressing. Key lime pie, a traditional meal-ender, is transformed into light layers of curd and cake in a glass jar.",0,0
1154,Brindille,French,4,"This posh bistro is located just steps away from NAHA, it's impressive sister restaurant from cousins Carrie and Michael Nahabedian. Hushed and intimate, the dining room is awash with a palette of soothing greys and dressed up with herringbone floors along with black-and-white photography. Brindille's menu isn't a sequel to NAHA's contemporary Mediterranean fare, but instead bears a strong Parisian accent influenced by the chef's love of French cuisine. Roasted chestnuts are whirled into a creamy soup and poured over compressed apple, wild mushrooms, and puffed rice. Spot-on Dover sole meuniere is plated with a purée of watercress and golden-crisp pommes rissolées. And for dessert, preserved cherries are just one option to fill the baked-to-order almond clafoutis.",0,0
1155,Lou Mitchell's,American,1,"At the top of Chicago's list of beloved names is Lou Mitchell. This eponymous diner is by no means an elegant affair, but thanks to its delicious omelets and iconic crowd, it has been on the Windy City's must-eat list since 1923. Don't panic at the length of the lines: they are long but move fast, and free doughnut holes (one of the restaurant's signature baked goods) make the wait go faster. Back to those omelets: they may be made with mere eggs, like everyone else's, but somehow these are lighter and fluffier, almost like a soufflé, stuffed with feta, spinach, onions, or any other ingredients of your choice. They arrive in skillets with an Idaho-sized helping of potatoes. The best part? Everyone gets a swirl of soft-serve at the meal's end.",0,0
1156,Grace,Contemporary,4,"Ask a passing foodie to name one of Chicago's most elegant and sophisticated restaurants and they'll probably say Grace. This room is as handsome as it is urbane and provides a supremely comfortable environment for those spending an evening discovering the culinary wizardry of Curtis Duffy. You'll be presented with a choice between two seasonally changing menus: ""Fauna"" or, for vegetarians, ""Flora."" Opt for the wine pairings and you're done on the decision making for the night. Trying to keep track of the ingredients of each dish will nullify the benefit of the wine, so instead just marvel at the clever presentation and dig in-because taste is what this food is all about. The dishes are intricate and elaborately constructed, with herbs playing an integral part rather than merely being a garnish. Occasionally your taste buds will get a little slap, perhaps with the odd Thai or Vietnamese flavor, and the courses will fly by. This style of cooking is very labor-intensive and if you want to learn more, then take advantage of their offer of a post-prandial kitchen tour.",3,1
1157,Baffo,Italian,3,"As the flagship fine dining experience of Eataly's mega food mecca, Baffo brings the Mario Batali brand of contemporary Italian cuisine to downtown Chicago. Dim lighting and stylized black-and-white accents add drama to the formal white-tablecloth space, which strives for sophistication despite stutter-start service that needs a bit more fine tuning to shine like a true Batali star. Thanks to truly top-notch ingredients, simple dishes like poached veal tongue with spicy giardiniera and caramelized onions stand out on the menu. Though pastas can verge on the edge of too al dente, braised short rib is perfectly fork-tender with a crunchy, buttery breadcrumb topping and rustic braised greens primed for soaking up the meat's rich jus.",0,0
1158,The Purple Pig,Mediterranean,2,"This Windy City haunt is so popular that the patio provides valuable real estate all year long by way of screens and heat lamps. If you are able to score a seat inside, where tightly packed tables bolster the accommodations, you'll enjoy a view of the kitchen from the Carrara marble bar. The extensive small plates menu is primed for pairing with the wine list, and unusual cuts of meat-like a panini with pork heart-take precedence. Inspired by a Chicago beef, this ciabatta roll is moistened with jus, stuffed full of pork, and dressed with sweet peppers and spicy-tangy giardiniera. A plethora of charcuterie, fried bites, and spreads like whipped feta with cucumbers guarantees all who sip and sup here leave with a full belly and wine-stained mouth.",0,0
1159,Michael Jordan's,Steakhouse,3,"Leave your dated 1993 Bulls jersey in the closet for a meal at this swanky steakhouse, tucked just off the lobby of the InterContinental Hotel. Leather and velvet accents telegraph an upscale vibe, and references to His Airness are subtle-from oversized sepia photographs of basketball netting to a 23-layer chocolate cake for dessert. A glass of Amarone with a dry-aged Porterhouse is always a slam-dunk, but the kitchen also turns out pleasing modern twists on steakhouse classics. Chicago's famous Italian beef gets an upgrade with smoked ribeye and aged provolone. Similarly, the traditional wedge salad is presented as a halved small head of baby romaine, layered here with creamy Wisconsin blue cheese and thick slabs of crispy bacon.",0,0
1160,Joe's,American,4,"Despite the ample neighborhood competition, this outpost of the original Miami seafood, steak, and stone crab palace does just fine up north. Clubby, masculine décor fashions a classic scene, while business diners and lively martini-toasting groups keep the leather booths full from lunch through dinner. Stone crab claws accompanied by signature mustard sauce are shared by nearly every table, followed by decadent dishes like a bone-in filet with their simple yet delicious coriander-spiked seasoning. Americana sides like Jennie's fontina and asiago mashed potatoes, or grilled tomatoes topped with cheesy spinach pesto, are ample enough to share. Joe's Key lime pie is rightly famous, but other retro sweets like coconut cream pie are worth a forkful.",0,0
1161,Labriola,Italian,2,"Supersizing his popular Oak Brook café, baker Rich Labriola expands his eponymous empire just off Michigan Avenue. The hangar-sized space is three operations in one: a café for pastries and casual bites; a bar; and a full-scale restaurant. Though the décor takes cues from French brasseries, the menus have a decidedly Italian focus. No matter where you're seated, you can sample the quality imported salumi and formaggio selections like Parma ham and Granduca pecorino, accompanied by charred bread and sharp chutney. Neopolitan pizzas, fritto misto, and house-made pastas like bucatini all'Amatriciana don't disappoint, and tiramisù gets a new twist in a mélange of velvety smooth chocolate mousse, espresso-infused mascarpone, and coffee-soaked cake cubes.",0,0
1162,David Burke's Primehouse,Steakhouse,3,"Banish thoughts of musty wood-paneled rooms from your mind and unwind at this chic-and slightly tongue-in-cheek-steakhouse in the boutique James Hotel. Rawhide tablecloths and masculine wood-and-rope décor elements hint at the ranch and open range, though the cocktails and young, trendy clientele at the accompanying bar are strictly urban. The all-American menu offers a wide selection of top-notch beef and hearty sides to match. Skewered cubes of maple syrup-smothered, black pepper-dusted bacon are a playful snack to share, a poppable prelude to the carnivorous courses to follow. Bone-in steaks like the 8-ounce filet are juicy and flavor-packed; many cuts are aged in-house in a Himalayan salt-tiled room for prime attention and coddling.",0,0
1163,Union Sushi + Barbeque Bar,Japanese,2,"The slogan of this big, bustling restaurant is ""Uniting Japanese culinary tradition with a distinctly American persona,"" which roughly translates to ""Japanese food with a party hat on."" The cocktails are good, the noise levels are high, and there are more tattoos in the room than a Yakuza convention. The menu will take forever to read so just go directly to their two specialties-the assorted sushi rolls, some of which use black rice, and meats and fish expertly cooked over an open flame on the seriously hot robata. The ingredients are good and the flavor combinations don't get silly. Just remember that sharing is the key to keeping that final check in check, especially as the T-shirted staff are masters of upselling with an iPad.",0,0
1164,Paramount Room,Gastropub,2,"Though a few blocks north of the hot-and-heavy Fulton Market food scene, this edgy joint, equal parts gastropub and dive bar, more than holds its own. To start, make like the cool kids and order something from the well-stocked bar: Moscow Mules are presented properly in frosty copper mugs, killer Bloody Marys are fortified by skewers of huge olives and blocks of dill Havarti, and the beer list boasts there's ""no crap on tap"". Paramount's menu features dishes that make the most of top-quality ingredients, like a plump burger crafted from 100 percent Wagyu beef on a toasted brioche bun. Daily specials have featured a trio of sweet and zesty pulled pork sliders sided by a heap of crisp and crunchy tempura-style green beans.",0,0
1165,Mercat a la Planxa,Spanish,2,"Within a cavernous space in the Renaissance Blackstone hotel, Mercat a la Planxa recreates the hustle and bustle of a Spanish marketplace with an extensive menu of Catalan tapas. The dining room's tightly packed tables are perfect for grazing, and soaring ceilings along with cathedral windows overlooking Grant Park impress locals and out-of-towners alike. Plump, crunchy gambas al ajillo are bathed in buttery garlic sauce with a hint of lemon, and servers add to the excitement by drizzling jus over skewers of bacon-wrapped lamb loin medallions at the table. This is the kind of place where nary a splash of sauce is left behind, so use those slices of brioche-with a swipe of sweet onion purée for good measure-to sop up every last delicious drop.",0,0
1166,Au Cheval,American,2,"This corner bar on Randolph Street's restaurant row may be dim, but it's got a few glittering edges. The reel-to-reel in the doorway lends a retro feel, but the rest is decidedly cushy. Late-night revelers prefer to sit at tufted leather booths or savor beers at the zinc-topped bar, rather than endure a wait for a table in the raucous space. Bartenders work just as hard as line cooks until the wee hours. The kitchen puts a highfalutin spin on simple bar eats. In-house butchers craft 32-ounce pork Porterhouses for sharing; foie gras for folding into fluffy scrambled eggs; and house-made sausages for bologna sandwiches that go well beyond a kid's wildest dreams. Thin griddled cheeseburger patties are perked up by maple syrup-glazed peppered bacon.",0,0
1167,The Franklin Room,American,2,"With a motto like ""Ladies and Gentlemen Welcome,"" it's no surprise that the subterranean space housing this modern-day tavern and whiskey bar is as inviting as they come. Surrounded by backlit bottles of top-notch spirits under wrought-iron latticework light panels, guests gather for convivial conversation and great drinks. Fans of Bourbon will delight in the Derby Day Mule, which swaps out vodka for Buffalo Trace. Pair your libation with rib-sticking dishes like a sandwich of garlic- and balsamic vinegar-roasted portobello mushroom caps layered with a runny egg, grilled tomato, and blue cheese; or a steaming bowl of braised duck soup complete with thick and silky pappardelle. End on a high note-think Bourbon-infused milkshake with house-made ice cream, natch.",0,0
1168,Side Door,Gastropub,2,"In a city with no shortage of steakhouses, Side Door dares to be different. It's the casual arm of Lawry's in the historic McCormick Mansion, offering the same quality and service without the power lunch vibe. Comfy leather banquettes and wide wooden tables are well spaced throughout the bi-level restaurant, offering a respite for shoppers to relax with a cheese plate and craft beer flight. Share an order of prime rib poutine among friends-it's drenched in beef gravy and pepper jack cheese-or go whole hog with the prime rib sandwich, which is hand-carved to order and presented tableside with horseradish cream and au jus. For something lighter but just as pleasurable, try the kale Caesar, with white anchovies and a delicately creamy garlic dressing.",0,0
1169,Girl & The Goat,Contemporary,2,"The revolving door never stops turning as Girl & The Goat's party keeps going. Even on a Monday night, guests linger for hours, shouting over the din at this sceney but always friendly stunner. Appropriately rustic wooden pillars and beams connect a warren of seating areas, from elevated platforms to banquettes to dim private corner nooks. A pick-your-own-protein adventure, the menu is organized by ingredient with a dedicated section for goat. Paper-thin goat carpaccio is dusted with fried capers, beads of smoked trout roe, and an olive-maple vinaigrette. Red currants brighten the luxe meatiness of wood-fired scallops with subtly smoked uni cream. The kitchen will even send out mini portions of menu items for solo diners-a truly thoughtful touch.",0,0
1170,Dolce,Italian,2,"With locations in Miami and Atlanta, Dolce's newest outpost lands in Chicago's popular River North neighborhood, tucked into the lobby of the stunning, Cubist-influenced Godfrey boutique hotel. The spacious dining room features a sleek interior with dark wood grain tiles, orange leather furnishings, tweed-lined banquettes, and enormous windows. Dolce offers a chic take on Italian dining, with a menu featuring pizzas, house-made pastas, and entrées like veal Milanese or fennel pollen-dusted roasted chicken. Try the cool watermelon salad studded with heirloom tomatoes, crumbled goat cheese, pea shoots, mint, and toasted pumpkin seeds. The pappardelle alla Bolognese arrives irresistibly silky and dressed in a wickedly good beef, pork, and veal ragù.",0,0
1171,¡Hello Tacos! De Cero,Mexican,2,"As a muy popular member of restaurant row, this spot takes the traditional taqueria and turns it on its head...with spice! Lively music keeps the energy level high, though low lighting lends a cozy vibe to the sleek wood-dominated space. Two rooms, each equipped with a bar, make it easy to get started with a strawberry-mint margarita or Mexican beer. Don't let the name change fool you; ¡Hello Tacos! is still everything you've come to love about De Cero over the years. Tacos are made with hand-pressed corn tortillas and ordered individually, letting diners sample a range of fillings including rich duck confit and spicy corn salsa. Ample chunks of carnitas with habanero salsa and julienned radish is another fave, while jalapeño-marinated skirt steak tortas are pressed to order and ooze with melting Chihuahua.",0,0
1172,Rural Society,Steakhouse,3,"This buzzy Argentinean steakhouse from prolific Chef Jose Garces brings a touch of international flair to Chicago's already meat-heavy roster. The ranch-inspired space is smart and upscale, with oversized iron chandeliers, framed photos of show cattle, and a painted wood kitchen from which a wood-fired oven and grill fill the air with a smoky aroma. In addition to excellent cuts of beef, Rural Society grills up stellar Maine lobster, chicken, and chops, while the oven produces mouthwatering Argentinean pizzas and homemade-spiced sausages. Be sure to try the plana di hierro and fritas, a South American version of traditional steak frites that boasts a subtly smoky flavor and a creamy, chili-spiced butter dip for those crispy chips.",0,0
1173,Oak + Char,American,2,"Despite its panoply of high-profile neighbors, this convivial haunt manages to maintain a relaxed, mellow vibe. Whether lounging over drinks and a bite from the innovative cocktail list and bar snacks menu, grabbing a quick soup-and-sandwich lunch, or going all out for dinner, guests are welcomed to sip, nibble, and chat as long as they like. The self-described ""modern Midwestern"" menu pulls influences and ingredients from around the globe, yet maintains a distinctly American feel in dishes like cotton cake-an airy Japanese-style cheesecake kept light with streaks of persimmon jam and basil streusel. Smoky wood-grilled eggplant pairs with red pepper jam on a hearty ciabatta sandwich, with irresistibly salty homemade potato chips straight from the fryer.",0,0
1174,Sumi Robata Bar,Japanese,2,"There's a degree of authenticity to this traditional robata bar and that includes the discreet entrance, although a spacious patio ultimately lets you know you're not in downtown Tokyo. Sit at the counter to best appreciate their specialty-the Japanese art of grilling. For a good value lunch look no further than the bento boxes, but come at night and you'll be able to try a variety of grilled items where the natural flavors shine through, whether that's Wagyu beef or crab. You can also try more unusual cuts that you may hitherto have avoided, such as chicken heart or tail. The service is smiley, helpful, and sincere. The guys behind the counter have a more serious countenance-well, good grilling is serious business.",0,0
1175,Sushi Dokku,Japanese,2,"Creatively adorned nigiri is the featured attraction at this hip sushi-ya that's all wood planks, stainless steel, chunky tables, and hefty benches. Just one piece of Sushi Dokku's supple cuts showcasing quality and technique is not enough-thankfully each nigiri order is served as pairs. Among the terrific selection, enjoy the likes of hamachi sporting a spicy mix of shredded Napa cabbage, daikon, and red chili; or salmon dressed with a sweet ginger-soy sauce and fried ginger chips. South Pacific sea bream is deliciously embellished with a drizzle of smoky tomato and black sea salt. Those who wish to branch out from sushi should go for tako yaki (crispy fried octopus croquettes), grilled hamachi collar, or a brownie-crusted green tea-cheesecake.",0,0
1176,Greek Islands,Greek,1,"This Greektown retreat sports multiple dining areas as well as a perpetually bustling bar. Diners sup among a Disney-fied décor of faux-terraces and balconies, overhangs topped by terra-cotta tiles, and a trellised ceiling entwined with artificial greenery. The chance of a courteous someone whose name ends in ""os"" attending to you is good, but it's the food that has kept the joint hopping for more than 40 years. Salads are crisp and refreshing, pan-seared cheese is flambéed tableside, and the fresh seafood doesn't disappoint: fish are grilled whole, filleted, and dressed simply with herbs, a few glugs of olive oil, and squeeze of lemon. Specialties include spetsofai, house-made sausage sautéed with onions and peppers in a red wine- and tomato-sauce.",0,0
1177,High Five Ramen,Japanese,1,"This re-purposed industrial setting is a hipster dining hall serving two hot foodie trends under one roof. The bulk of the sprawling space is devoted to Green Street Smoked Meats, a barbecue joint where crowds of cool kids sit side-by-side downing beers and heaps of pulled pork, brisket, and Frito pie. More worthy of attention, however, is High Five Ramen, a downstairs nook where the queue for one of its 16-seats starts early. Once inside, slurp a bowl of the signature, crazy-spicy broth. Loaded with thin alkaline noodles, a slow-cooked egg, roasted pork belly, locally grown sprouts, and black garlic oil, this unique rendition is worth the burn. For sweet, icy relief, sip on a slushy tiki cocktail-then wipe your brow and dig back in.",0,0
1178,Little Goat Diner,American,2,"Every Chicago neighborhood needs a good diner and in the booming West Loop, this enthusiastic homage to the reliable road trip stopover fits in perfectly. The décor gives a wink and a nod to classic design with retro booths, spinning chrome barstools, and blue-rimmed plates, but the top-quality materials keep it on the modern side. A morning-to-night menu of amped-up diner favorites can be had no matter the hour: craving a shrimp cocktail at 7:00 A.M.? Five jumbo fried shrimp wrapped in somen noodles are ready to go. The Goat Almighty burger lives up to its name with fatty beef brisket, saucy pulled pork, and a ground goat patty. Before hitting the road, grab a cup of Stumptown-and maybe a s'mores cookie-from LG Bread, the next-door bakery and coffee bar.",0,0
1179,Prosecco,Italian,2,"No matter the hour, it's always time for bubbly at Prosecco, where a complimentary flute of the namesake Italian sparkler starts each meal. This fizzy wine inspires the restaurant's elegant décor, from creamy pale walls and damask drapes to travertine floors. Sit at the long wooden bar or in one of the well-appointed dining rooms for a second glass chosen from the long list of frizzante and spumante wines. Hearty dishes spanning the many regions of Italy cut through the heady bubbles. Carpaccio selections include the classic air-dried bresaola as well as whisper-thin seared rare duck breast. Saltimbocca di vitello marries tender veal medallions with crispy Prosciutto di Parma and creamy mozzarella, with hints of sage in the tomato-brandy sauce.",0,0
1180,Tre Soldi,Italian,2,"Set a few steps above street level, Tre Soldi's tomato-red awning and floor-to-ceiling windows beckon Michigan Avenue shoppers and business lunchers. Inside, splashes of red-and-white allude subtly to those classic red-sauce joints complete with checkered tablecloths, but glossy ceramic-tiled columns and Italian stone floors up the ante. Rome and its surroundings inspire the menu and all-Italian wine list. Local Slagel Family Farm's beef becomes carpaccio, shingled on the plate and drizzled with tangy mustard aïoli, fresh parsley, and celery leaves. Thin-crust pizzas strewn with quality ingredients like cavolo nero, featuring caramelized onions and pecorino, are large enough to share. Finish with dark chocolate-hazelnut tarts, perfectly balanced by apricot jam.",0,0
1181,The Boarding House,International,2,"The long-awaited passion project from Chicago master sommelier Alpana Singh, The Boarding House has thrown its doors open to four floors of grandeur. The impressively shimmering wine glass clusters dangling in the first floor bar lead way to the upper dining room, which pulls out all the stops by virtue of its arched, mullioned windows and an installation made from more than 4,000 green wine bottles. Small and larger plates make sharing an appealing proposition. House-made tagliolini ribbons tossed with fresh peas, mint, and pickled ramps are bright and zesty. Garlic lovers use crispy chicken thighs to sop up every last bit of aromatic green-garlic pistou. Scoops of sour cherry gelée and merlot-chocolate chip ice cream crown rich brownies for dessert.",0,0
1182,Momotaro,Japanese,2,"Boka Restaurant Group's stunning West Loop canteen embraces a fantastical view of Japanese dining. An impressive selection of imported whiskies is listed on a retro-style departure board; a private dining room upstairs is styled to resemble a mid-century corporate boardroom; and a traditional izakaya beckons diners downstairs. Consistently packed, the AvroKO-designed space boasts numerous kitchens churning out a wide range of dishes. Creative bites abound in the chef's omakase featuring torched baby squid wrapped in nori. Then a Hawaiian seaweed salad with diced nopales may be tailed by robata-grilled Wagyu skirt steak with foie gras, shisito pepper, and yuzu kosho. The steamed yuzu pudding cake is just one example of the surprisingly strong dessert roster.",0,0
1183,Nellcôte,Italian,2,"The orange canopy above Nellcôte's entrance and stylish plaque would not look out of place on the Côte d'Azur. Named after the villa where the Rolling Stones recorded their iconic Exile on Main Street, this West Loop rock star-decked out with a lacquered ivory bar, marble staircase, and antique chandeliers-feels like a playground for the glam. Vases of dried lavender evoke scents of the Mediterranean, as do the kitchen's creations, which feature homemade ravioli filled with favas, a poached egg, and parmesan broth. A hearty and succulent Berkshire pork chop with sweet roasted yams and spicy grated horseradish needs no sides; whereas black pepper semifreddo between chocolate shortbread is particularly memorable when paired with red wine-poached pears.",0,0
1184,Maude's Liquor Bar,French,2,"Don't be fooled by the aged patina of this sexy boîte: though a few items like the overstuffed curio cabinet and salvaged French metal chairs are true antiques, this chicly disheveled hang has been hiding out on West Randolph for only a few years. Contemporary and classic cocktails like a violet-tinged Aviator are served in champagne coupes, adding to the vintage atmosphere. Head to the second-floor bar to snack on oysters and frites, or fill up on Francophile comfort food under the glow of mismatched crystal chandeliers. Juicy, garlicky Toulouse-style pork sausage is served whole over bacon-stewed lentils, and smashed potatoes are rich with chicken jus. Sugar fiends will delight in the crème brûlée, which sports the perfect crackling sugar veneer.",0,0
1185,graham elliot Bistro,American,2,"It's not likely you'll see peripatetic MasterChef Graham Elliot working the line at this bistro any time soon, but his namesake retains the pizzazz it brought years ago as a newcomer to the West Loop. Dramatic backlighting, colorful mosaics, and modern stained glass brighten the narrow, high-ceilinged space. The kitchen hums along in time to music bouncing off polished concrete floors. Simple comfort food goes upscale with the kitchen's cleverly deconstructed dishes. A breakfast-for-dinner twist on salmon becomes a perfectly seared fillet atop a dilled cream cheese ""schmear;"" an everything bagel tuile and onion jam drive the point home. Chicken noodle soup becomes pillowy mousseline-filled agnolotti on a bed of sunchoke purée and roasted carrots.",0,0
1186,Grange Hall Burger Bar,American,1,"American Gothic accents (think Grant Wood) invade the big city at Grange Hall, where a down-on-the-farm vibe is telegraphed loud and clear through swinging barn doors, quilted panels hanging above the lunch counter, and mismatched knit napkins set atop tables with wooden chairs and stools. The glassed-in pie kitchen in the back hints dessert won't be an afterthought. Choose your own adventure when building a burger, starting with a six- or nine-ounce grass-fed beef patty and adding toppings like Midwestern cheeses, smoked bacon, jalapeños, or homemade pickles. If a wedge of strawberry rhubarb pie or Bourbon-spiked milkshake is calling your name (especially when freshly churned ice cream is involved), go easy on those hand-cut farmhouse chili fries.",0,0
1187,Jaipur,Indian,2,"Business execs expecting the ubiquitous lunch buffet will be sorely disappointed by Jaipur-that is until they realize this popular weekday spot serves an affordable full-service lunch special that brings the buffet to your table in a parade of hammered copper katoris. In the evening, locals fill every sleek, nail-studded chair in the refined dining room as they await plates of boldly flavored Indian cooking. The broad menu features a lengthy selection of fresh and authentically treated favorites, most of which are available as part of the bountiful lunch special. Staples on the vast à la carte menu may include aloo papdi chaat; a rich and creamy chicken korma; spiced carrot soup; and scarlet-red tandoori chicken, served with garlic naan.",0,0
1188,The Publican,Gastropub,2,"The phrase ""meat market"" has many connotations at The Publican: everything about this bustling Fulton Market spot is communal, from the sprawling U-shaped table that dominates the space and the penned-in booths lining the perimeter to the sink outside the washrooms. That said, the ubiquitous pig-centric décor gives a more straightforward idea of what you'll find on the menu. As expected, pork takes precedence here with rillettes, platters of paper-thin aged ham slices, and house-made blood sausage to pair with one of the superlative beer selections. Weekend brunch gets in on the game with thickly sliced Publican bacon basted with Burton's maple syrup, or savory mushroom-and-chard French toast topped with roasted tomato and a fried egg.",0,0
1189,Les Nomades,French,4,"A giddy excitement bubbles through the air at Les Nomades, and with good reason: this intimate, charming restaurant feels like a secret hideaway within a gated Streeterville brownstone. Owner Mary Beth Liccioni welcomes all as if they were old friends, seating guests among the graciously arranged fresh flowers, framed artwork, and linen-topped tables. Though the fragrant herb-loaded lavash presented at each table is good enough to make an entire meal out of, save room for entrées like grilled Scottish salmon, served medium-rare with a colorful, flavorful mélange of beets, cucumber, and black olive tapenade. A single translucent langoustine raviolo duets on a plate with tempura soft shell crab, both enhanced by harissa- and saffron-spiked rouille.",0,0
1190,Chicago Curry House,Indian,1,"Maybe you sniff the wafting aromas of ginger, garlic, and cumin first; maybe you hear the sitar music tinkling its welcoming notes as you enter. Either way, you know immediately that Chicago Curry House is a commendable showcase of Indian and Nepalese cuisine. The lunch buffet lets you eat your fill for under $12, with crispy pappadum, baskets of fresh naan, and must-have curries like the Nepalese khasi ko maasu with chunks of bone-in stewed goat in a velvety cardamom- and black pepper-sauce. Indian butter chicken, creamy and rich in a tomato- and garam masala-spiced stew, is equally sumptuous. À la carte offerings are even more extensive. The staff has helpful suggestions for dealing with the area's draconian parking restrictions, so call ahead for tips.",0,0
1191,Indian Garden,Indian,2,"Frequent diners know it as ""The IG,"" but first-timers will appreciate the copious lunch buffet as much as the doctors, med students, and locals. These faithful droves routinely make the trip up a few flights of stairs to get their pakora and tandoori fix on, among kitschy but ornate touches like richly colored fabrics and wafting incense. Though the à la carte menu offers Northern Indian dishes brought to the table in shiny copper vessels, the lunch buffet covers all bases with vegetarian, chicken, and lamb items. Staples like saag, dal, naan, and basmati rice are freshly made. Bhuna gosht mixes succulent lamb with tomatoes, onions, and spices; while lassi or masala tea provide refreshment along with a decent selection of wine, beer, and cocktails.",0,0
1192,Tru,Contemporary,4,"Fine dining at Tru has a strong air of formality that extends from the service team to the moneyed, well-dressed clientele. Beyond the discreet exterior, find an intimate lounge with a spotlit and vivid blue sculpture. Decorative branches and net curtains divide the cavernous space; while white walls adorned with Warhol lithographs lend a luxe-gallery feel. Leather and velvet banquettes surrounding well-spaced tables are popular for quiet gatherings or romantic interludes. The variety of dining options begins with an excellent prix-fixe, extending all the way up to a deep-pocketed caviar selection. However, the menu fulfills its literal promise of exploring Chef Anthony Martin's very modern kitchen. Superlative talent is abundantly clear in the smooth and silky foie gras covered in a thin shell of sugar and counterbalanced by segments of blood orange. Succulent and pearly white halibut is seared to perfection and seasoned with a warm, chive-infused cream sauce, while Berkshire pork is the center of an impeccable presentation of ""petit vegetables"" including brilliantly crisp and tender peas. Solid desserts include an apple strudel filled with golden currants and flanked by an icy scoop of pear sorbet. Splurge on the extraordinary wine pairings.",1,1
1193,Brasserie by LM,French,2,"Taking its cue from the neighborhood cafés that dot the boulevards of Paris, Brasserie by LM brings a bit of stylish French spirit to Michigan Avenue. Despite its chi-chi surroundings at the Essex Inn across from Grant Park, this is an understated modern diner, serving up affordably priced bistro fare from morning to night. The croque monsieur is a totem of indulgence, layered with ham and béchamel, then lavishly buttered for grilling and blanketed with melted cheese. Skin-on pommes frites pair pleasantly with the sandwich, but grilled Caesar salad drizzled with a garlicky dressing is slightly more inculpable. Splurge on the signature teurgoule, a classic rice pudding from Normandy made with plump, toothsome grains and heaps of cinnamon.",0,0
1194,Farmhouse,Gastropub,2,"Like shaking the hand of your local farmer, grab the pitchfork door handles of Farmhouse and you'll be almost as close to the source of your food. Much of the décor is salvaged and much of the menu is procured right from the Midwest. From Indiana chicken to Michigan wine, local is more than a buzzword. Exposed brick, rough-hewn wood, and wire-encased filament bulbs make it the quintessential modern tavern. Highlights of the harvest headline each course. Whole-grain mustard dresses up a vibrant (and requisite) beet salad. Nueske's bacon is the star in a rustic BLT, accompanied by Klug Farms peaches tossed with balsamic dressing. Cream cheese-frosted carrot bread pudding is fragrant from autumn spices, layered with a golden raisin purée and nutmeg crunch.",0,0
1195,Giordano's,Pizza,1,"Value, friendly service, and delicious deep-dish pizza make Giordano's a crowd sweetheart. With several locations dotting the city and suburbs, this restaurant has been gratifying locals with comforting Italian-American fare for years. Come during the week-service picks up especially at dinner-to avoid the cacophony. Giordano's menu includes your typical salads, pastas, et al., but you'd do well to save room for the real star: the deep-dish. Bring backup because this pie could feed a small country. The spinach version arrives on a buttery pastry crust, filled with spreads of sautéed (or steamed) spinach with tomato sauce, and topped with mozzarella and parmesan. For those cold, windy nights, opt for delivery-their website sketches a detailed menu.",0,0
1196,The Dawson,Gastropub,2,"""See and be seen"" should be the motto of this hip spot, where globe lights shine like beacons through the façade's towering windows. Inside, a wraparound bar attracts spirited guests like moths to a flame. A lengthy communal table and open kitchen with a chef's counter offer multiple opportunities for meeting, greeting, and eating. Cocktails like the Surfer Rosa, which balances tequila and mezcal with blood orange and chilies, loosen-up diners jonesing for big flavors. When hunger strikes, caramelized onion sabayon, potato confit, and garlicky pea shoots add depth to an Arctic char fillet. And lest you forget dessert, Bourbon-pecan bread pudding set upon flash-frozen vanilla cream and drizzled with sea salt-butterscotch sauce, is meant for sharing-or not.",0,0
1197,The Lobby,Contemporary,3,"You can't say you weren't warned. The Peninsula people sensibly realized that honesty was best when naming this vast space which looks remarkably like...a lobby. At least the friendly staff manages to wrestle back some control, and you know your conversation won't be overheard-because there aren't any tables near you. So why the recommendation? Because the food is very good. The lunch menu doesn't really get past lobster rolls and chicken legs, but at night the kitchen's innate skill is very much in evidence. Dishes are good-looking, but also have depth and ingredients are of irreproachable quality. Flavors marry well and there are intriguing touches of originality but never at the expense of the overall balance of the dish.",0,0
1198,Piccolo Sogno,Italian,2,"In-the-know locals craving mouthwatering Italian fare head to this swanky spot, usually packed with a dressy crowd. Inside, they are welcomed by a palette of rich, cool hues, crystal-beaded light fixtures that hang overhead, and an open kitchen boasting a wood-burning oven. Piccolo Sogno's rustic, yet refined menu offers traditional dishes with a twist. A version of the ubiquitous beet salad (both red and golden) is elevated here by shaved fennel, a drizzle of bright citrus oil, and a dollop of creamy, lush buffalo milk ricotta. If you need further encouragement, let us recommend the rabbit. Braised in a white wine sauce redolent of rosemary and lemon, the tender meat is served with wilted escarole and porridge-like semolina pudding.",0,0
1199,Fulton Market Kitchen,Contemporary,3,"Floor-to-ceiling windows put Embeya's industrial interior on display, letting passersby soak up its intriguing sculptural elements and Asian-inspired decor. Inside, blown-glass bouquets of light fixtures hang above communal tables, and wooden screens in intricate cutout patterns divide the lofty, airy dining room and open kitchen, where Chef Mike Sheerin and his team whip up enticing Pan-Asian fare. The affordable lunch menu features dishes like carrot salad with shaved country ham, an assertively spicy togarashi dressing, and a swipe of yuzu curd; or udon in a thickened broth with diced tofu and seasonal vegetables. Dinner entrées display more ambition, as in poached halibut with coconut, hearts of palm, and mint fumet.",0,0
1200,Gino's East,Pizza,2,"Pizza pilgrims continue to make the trek to the original location of this renowned local deep-dish chain, where a 45 minute wait is the norm. However, solo diners may rest assured as they can order personal pies from a walk-up counter. The walls, scribbled with years of graffiti, are nearly as iconic as the high-walled pies themselves, whose crusts get their signature crunch from cornmeal and searing-hot metal pans rife with two inch-high sides. Filled with heaps of mozzarella and toppings like the ""Meaty Legend"" lineup of spicy pepperoni, Italian sausage, and both Canadian and regular bacon before getting sauced, it's hard to eat more than two wedges here. Nonconformists can of course opt for thin-crust pies, gussied-up by add-ons like roasted red peppers.",0,0
1201,RL,American,3,"If you swoon for tartan and pine for the posh life Ralph Lauren represents, head for the boîte attached to the flagship Michigan Avenue store. Like a stylish private club but without the centuries of stuffiness, RL offers options for a quick solo lunch, cocktail at the mahogany bar, or full dinner. The odd Blackhawks jersey here and there doesn't detract from the overall aura. The menu is as classically American as the name, featuring bistro favorites like Waldorf salad and raw bar offerings alongside well-prepared dishes like sweet and plump pan-seared scallops with white balsamic-crème fraîche. The thin, flaky crust of a goat cheese- and caramelized onion-tart nearly steals the show from the rich atmosphere of the wood-paneled dining room.",0,0
1202,NoMI Kitchen,American,3,"A hushed aerie awaits on the seventh floor of the Park Hyatt at NoMI Kitchen. Let the dapper staff whisk you through the hotel lobby and elevator to a glassed-in dining room with Water Tower views. A semi-open kitchen doesn't detract from the lush but restrained décor, and a breezy terrace offers an alfresco option with a different menu. Chef Ryan LaRoche's impressive, ingredient-driven dishes are equally inspired by Eastern and Western cuisines. Fresh fish makes for a seaworthy selection of sushi and maki, while pickled pepper jam and sweet pine nut streusel pair with orbs of fried caponata-style eggplant that are crispy on the outside and perfectly silky within. End with a parade of house-made ice cream flavors like toasted vanilla marshmallow.",0,0
1203,La Sirena Clandestina,Latin American,2,"A relaxing Caribbean vibe breezes its way northward to Fulton Market and settles within La Sirena Clandestina's aquamarine walls. Languidly spinning fans, light filtered through antique etched glass panels, and an international selection of sippable rum and mezcal all conspire to bring guests' blood pressure down a notch or two. Baked empanadas rotate through a series of fillings, but these popular pockets never leave the menu. Whether stuffed with venison ragù or ricotta, hazelnut, and butternut squash, they're all exceptional. Handfuls of Manchego add decadence to plump bomba rice studded with fiery pickled jalapeño rings, toasted pepitas, and buttery white corn. Classic alfajore shortbreads filled with dulce de leche and sea salt are a memorable send-off.",0,0
1204,NEXT,Contemporary,4,"Welcome to dinner as theater, where the only thing more radical than each new theme is the success (or failure) of the cuisine. Next's conceit is reinvention. It may begin the year as, say, a culinary homage to French ""Bistro"" cooking with hit-or-miss fare that does little to underscore the kitchen's strengths. The long, dark, windowless room reflects that theme with a smattering of typical trappings, like chalkboard specials on the wall and little ceramic roosters on the table. Some concepts may be rooted in regional innovation, offering an array of Spanish ""Tapas."" Months later, the chefs may craft small plates with an eye on wine and global ""Terrior."" This is a very unique place with an adept and dexterous kitchen, but the experience just isn't for everyone.",0,0
1205,Eleven City Diner,Deli,1,"Nosh on a mile-high sandwich or chocolate malt at Eleven City Diner, a modern revival of the classic Jewish deli. Gleaming subway tiles play off retro leather booths and swiveling barstools, while jazz in the background keeps things moving with chutzpah and finesse. Diner standards include patty melts, sandwiches piled with corned beef or pastrami, knishes, and latkes. Bubbie's chicken soup comes bobbing with a fluffy matzo ball the size of a baseball; while Junior's cheesecake from Brooklyn or a triple-decker wedge of red velvet cake sates all the sweet-loving guests. A full-service deli counter offers salamis and smoked fish to-go. For a true blast from the past, stop by the candy stand near the entry stocked with Bazooka Joe and other favorites.",0,0
1206,Bistronomic,French,2,"Tucked away from the buzz of the Magnificent Mile, Bistronomic is a great place to cool your tired heels. Jaunty red awnings beckon brightly, and the revolving door spins guests into a warm room that's focused on the bonhomie of dining with friends. Oxblood walls, gray banquettes, and a central bar play up the bistro feel, while the kitchen conveys creativity with fresh renditions of tasty classics. Rusticity and elegance come together in a fillet of Lake Superior whitefish that is pan-seared to golden-brown and matched with spring ratatouille, preserved lemon, and puréed eggplant. Exquisitely crisp feuilletine is a glamorous upgrade to the classic Kit Kat bar, folded with hazelnuts, bittersweet chocolate, and finished with a sweet-tart orange sauce.",0,0
1207,La Sardine,French,2,"In a neighborhood packed to the gills with gastronomic innovation, La Sardine may be the most daring option of all, flaunting hearty French bistro food in a warm and rustic setting. The time-tested combination of wheezing accordion music, white linens, tile floors, and pastoral murals makes it all the rage among diners craving the familiar-and a $30 lunch prix-fixe doesn't hurt either. From escargots and steak tartare to bouillabaisse and steak frites, Chef/owner Jean-Claude Poilevey nails the classic bistro dishes. Don't miss the steak haché, a patty of excellent ground beef seared to perfection, then topped with smoked goat cheese and plated with truffle-laced Bibb lettuce, a thick slice of maple bacon, and crunchy fried onion rings.",0,0
1208,mk,American,3,"After nearly two decades in business, larger than life ""mk"" still welcomes all to Chef/owner Michael Kornick's eponymous flagship. Rich brown tones warm up the former paint factory's lofty interior, which features a skylit space that's beloved citywide for big nights and romantic evenings. There's a seasonal dish here to sate every appetite, whether diners are seated at linen-draped tables or perched on sleek stools in the lounge area. Bar bites offer upscale indulgences like bison sliders tucked into bone marrow-buttered focaccia, while a dual preparation of tartares-yellowfin tuna with Moroccan olives complementing Scottish salmon with charred red onion-could be a meal on its own. For dessert, citrusy ""Where troubles melt like lemon drops"" is every bit as charming as its name.",0,0
1209,Pizano's,Pizza,1,"While Chicago may be hailed as home of the deep-dish pizza, the thin-crust pies at Pizano's have justly earned their own devoted following. This refreshing and cozy local spot recalls Italian-American style without feeling like a chain-restaurant cliché; even the waitstaff's genuine warmth is palpable. Of course, the crowds come for the crust-here it is flaky, buttery, thin (by local standards), and perfectly crisp. As unexpected as it sounds, their pizzas are some of the best in town. And yet, it should be no surprise as pizza has long been the family calling: owner Rudy Malnati's father founded Pizzeria Uno. The ""thinner"" offspring at Pizano's sates its growing fan-base from three locations, and even ships to those far from the Second City.",0,0
1210,Vera,Spanish,2,"Pimentón de la Vera, one of the most powerful spices in Spanish cuisine, also provides partial inspiration for this first-come, first-served wine bar in the West Loop dining corridor. (The other homage? Chef/owner Mark Mendez's grandmother.) Exposed brick walls and walnut floors are typically lovely, but do little to soften the din of a happy hour crowd after a few glasses of sherry. Classic tapas as well as ham-and-cheese flights comprise the menu, along with larger plates like a piled-high paella with rabbit, duck, and chorizo. Shell out a few extra dollars for crusty bread to sop up the garlicky, lemony olive oil that bathes their plump head-on shrimp. Grilled rounds of octopus are sweet and smoky thanks to a liberal dose of good old pimentón.",0,0
1211,Café des Architectes,Contemporary,3,"European sophistication lends extra polish to this shimmering contemporary spot in the Sofitel Hotel, where ""Bonjour"" is passed around freely by the mostly French staff. The dining room is just as chic, with crimson banquettes, black-and-white portraits of the city's architectural marvels, and floor-to-ceiling windows with striking steel accents. The seasonally shifting lineup of small plates is simple but creative, like a single Wianno oyster dabbed with fennel cream and crowned with spoonfuls of both sturgeon and faux citrus caviar. Market-inspired entrées include butternut squash ribbons curling over tender beef short rib and vanilla-tinged salsify purée. For a more casual, small bites affair, move to Le Bar, the hotel's chic watering hole.",0,0
1212,deca,Contemporary,2,"Part of the Ritz-Carlton's expansive 12th floor lobby, deca is a casual haunt that still keeps a few high-end accents around. Paintings hung in gilded frames add to the attractiveness in the seated dining area; and a gently trickling sculptural fountain (illuminated by a skylight) offers an auditory escape from the lobby's background buzz. The well-edited menu features light, seasonal dishes that are skillfully prepared. Two large pillows of freshly made squash ravioli are garnished with hearty kale pistou, pickled wild mushrooms, and toasted pepitas. Wild salmon with a crunchy mustard crust is bathed in luxurious garlic-red wine jus. Finish in style with a wedge of tangy lemon tart decorated with fresh raspberries and set atop a neat pool of coulis.",0,0
1213,Tête Charcuterie,French,2,"No greater respect can be shown to a former meatpacking warehouse than by converting it into a restaurant specialising in charcuterie. This most ancient of culinary arts is joyfully celebrated here in all its forms-there are cured meats, wonderful glistening terrines, rich pâtés, and plump homemade sausages. This is roll-your-sleeves-up food that will put hair on your chest. The enthusiasm of the on-view kitchen team is palpable. Curing is done in-house and there's a separate Sausage Room where they create their own varieties, which range from a French boudin blanc to Moroccan inspired merguez. But don't think they can't show a light touch when required: the ""spring garden"" served en cocotte is one of the prettiest things you'll see.",0,0
1214,Pelago,Italian,3,"Adjacent to Hotel Raffaello, the elegance of this brick structure is accentuated by large arched windows. Inside, the bi-level room wears a crisp style à la high ceilings, eminently comfortable leather seats, and a soft azure-blue color scheme. If the décor doesn't transport you to the Mediterranean in a flash, look to the regional Italian menu with ingredients imported directly. A salad of plum tomatoes topped with creamy burrata and fragrant basil in a light dressing is as inherently satisfying. So, too, are pasta signatures including rich risotto alle verdure or creamy ricotta-filled ravioli swimming in a vibrant sauce of spinach and showered with slivers of nutty parmesan. Swap dessert for a fine selection of imported cheeses, and never look back.",0,0
1215,Vora,Asian,2,"Whether you're a carnivore, herbivore, or somewhere in between, Vora's plethora of Asian offerings aims to please. The modern space puts nature at the forefront with vine-like clusters of light bulbs snaking above bars, room dividers punctuated with floral cutouts, and sprightly lime-green banquettes. Can't choose from the health-oriented lineup of Taiwanese dim sum, Indian curries, or Chinese classics? The dim sum box is actually a bento offering a dizzying array of multi-cultural tastes: soft shrimp siu mai, juicy xiao long bao, steamed pork buns, and miso soup, as well as other bites. Slices of Sichuan beef and vegetables stir-fried with chili sauce can be amped up to match Chinatown's level of heat, or toned down to suit milder tastes.",0,0
1216,Spiaggia,Italian,4,"This modern bi-level dining room showcases subdued shades of gray, an intricately tiled marble floor, and spacious seating that only money can buy. Its views of the lake and Magnificent Mile are just as priceless. Glass ""caves"" for wine and cheese, and charcuterie served at the bar whet the appetite. The kitchen reflects its elegant surrounds in treating each meticulously sourced ingredient with care, respect, and talent. Modern twists are clear throughout the menu, yet Spiaggia remains a very classic Italian restaurant. This is immediately evident in pasta courses such as the springy and resilient fresh tajarin; the thin and pale yellow noodles are twirled with a none-too-buttery sauce and generous shaving of fragrant white truffles. ""Little hats"" or cappelletti are stuffed with duck confit, leeks, and Parmigiano, then served in a rich duck consommé amid poached egg and dehydrated hen of the woods mushrooms. Venison with white truffles, chestnut purée, and tart macerated mulberries is amazingly delicate on all levels. Finish with puffs of blood orange meringue with pine-rosemary essence and pine-nut brittle. Ignore the occasional trip-ups and upsells; dining here is a true culinary journey.",1,1
1217,Cafe Spiaggia,Italian,2,"After an extensive renovation, Cafe Spiaggia is sporting a sophisticated, contemporary new look, with beautiful white tufted leather banquettes, dark wood tables, and black-and-white photos gracing the wall. Towards the back, leather stools line a long white marble bar, and majestic floor-to-ceiling windows offer views of Magnificent Mile. The menu is solid and approachable Italian-a decidedly less formal alternative to sophisticated older sister, Spiaggia, next door. Kick things off with the piadini, a thin Romagna-style flatbread, grilled and folded around delicious fillings like mortadella, maybe a caprese, or even chicken and honey. Then, slide on over to the kitchen's focus-gemelli humming with summer beans, preserved lemon, Pecorino Romano, and Prosciutto di Parma.",0,0
1218,Nico Osteria,Italian,3,"Buzz around Nico Osteria has already reached deafening levels, especially since this Paul Kahan spot isn't tucked into a gentrifying corner of the city, but situated smack dab in the center of the chic Gold Coast. Communal bar seating keeps the space humming with energy, but moody lighting conspires to keep the vibe relaxed. Though billed as Italian-inspired cooking, the kitchen takes liberties with traditional dishes on the seafood-heavy menu. Well-grilled and generously oiled sourdough fett'unta topped with combinations like baccalà and Dungeness crab are rustic introductions to the meal. Ask for more bread to soak up the Neapolitan-style ragù-a skillet bubbling with goodies like a swordfish meatball and slabs of grilled pork belly in a tomato gravy.",0,0
1219,Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House,American,2,"Housed in a sprawling setting adjacent to big brother Gibson's, Hugo's always seems packed. The vast dining room sets white linen-topped tables amidst dark polished wood and pale walls decorated with a mounted swordfish, fish prints, and model ships. Hugo's bar draws its own crowds with abundant counter seating. The menu focuses on a selection of fish preparations as well as steaks and chops. These are supplemented by stone crab claws, oysters, crab cakes, chowders, and sautéed frog's legs. Speaking of frog's legs, the restaurant takes its name from the nickname of owner Hugo Ralli's grandfather, General Bruce Hay of Her Majesty's Imperial Forces. Bring a football team to share a slice of the Muddy Bottom Pie, a decadent (and enormous) ice cream cake.",0,0
1220,Merlo on Maple,Italian,3,"Inside a graciously decorated Victorian townhouse, Chef/owner Luisa Silvia Marani proudly showcases the bounty of her native Bologna with an Emiliana-inflected accent and delicious Northern Italian fare. Her frequently changing roster of luscious dishes are edible billboards for the foods of the region-think mortadella di Bologna and tartufi neri del'Umbria. Rabbit ragù clings to delicate parsley-flecked bow tie pasta tossed with Parmigiano-Reggiano and copious handfuls of butter. Wine-braised bone-in lamb shank, served in its own rich sauce, needs little else to shine. Signature budino di mascarpone, cioccolato e caffé is the standard-bearer for proper tiramisù, accompanied by tart sugar-coated red currants to offset the creamy sweetness.",0,0
1221,TWO,American,2,"This urban interpretation of a Midwest tavern was set up by two owners, features two chefs, second-hand furnishings, and an address whose last digit is-you guessed it-the number two. Step past the vintage Toledo scales to arrive at this reclaimed wood-paneled space dressed with antique meat cleavers, quaint ceiling fans, and large barn doors. If that doesn't scream farm-to-fork cuisine, consider what's being whipped up in the open kitchen (the banquette across from it affords the best view): a ramp raviolo filled with ricotta, a perfectly cooked hen's egg, and enhanced by brown butter and shiitakes; or a halibut fillet with cherry tomatoes and asparagus. On the sweet front, homemade puppy chow is chilled, crisp, and delicious with a uniform sugar dusting.",0,0
1222,Tuscany on Taylor,Italian,2,"Italian and Chicago accents co-mingle at Tuscany on Taylor, where the classic cuisine and service are perfectly old-school (no pun intended-the university is a few blocks away). The formal staff tends to diners at white linen-topped tables in the terra cotta-tiled dining room. Chefs in puffy toques man the open kitchen amid shelves of polished copper pans. A wide-ranging menu of modern Italian interpretations takes guests on a whirlwind tour of the boot. Tiny ravioli stuffed with roasted pears are set in a densely flavorful mascarpone cream sauce with toasted pine nuts and strips of sundried tomatoes. A simple caprese salad arrives as three stacks of thickly sliced heirloom tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, and basil pesto drizzled with balsamic reduction.",0,0
1223,Bistrot Zinc,French,2,"If you couldn't tell from the bright red exterior and hand-painted windows, Bistrot Zinc is indeed a classic dressed in mosaic-tiled floors, lemon-tinted walls hung with mirrors, woven rattan chairs, and yes, that curvaceous zinc bar. Suits, locals, and Gold Coast power shoppers populate the tables from lunch through dinner, as white-aproned waiters happily uncork bottles of rouge et blanc. Don't look for modern surprises on the menu; contentment here is attained through uncomplicated but expertly prepared French dishes from frites to frisée. Whole trout, pan-fried until golden and napped with butter sauce, hits all the right notes; while daily standards like croque monsieur or French onion soup are enhanced by more ambitious monthly specials.",0,0
1224,Kurah,Middle Eastern,2,"The phrase ""small plates"" doesn't always translate to ""great value,"" but Kurah offers an exception to the rule with its affordable selection of shareable, Middle Eastern-influenced dishes. Featuring Arabic-inspired wallpaper and upholstered seats, the setting is as warm and cozy as the open grill blazing away in the kitchen. Build a meal from hot and cold tapas options like muthowma, a blend of silky potatoes and whipped garlic that's perfect for scooping onto warm pita bread. Larger meat platters like a single juicy lamb and beef kifta kabob, served with roasted vegetables and golden saffron rice, make a hearty meal for one. For dessert, dark chocolate oozes invitingly between layers of phyllo and crushed walnuts in a tasty twist on classic baklava.",0,0
1225,Table Fifty-Two,Southern,3,"Chef Art Smith's drawl floats overhead like a warm breeze as he chats up guests inside Table Fifty-Two's cozy white row house, a stately survivor of the Great Chicago Fire. Southern charm permeates every inch of the room, from the pressed-copper ceiling to the white sideboards to a wood-burning oven churning out the restaurant's signature biscuits. The meal might get started with an amuse-bouche of deviled eggs topped with pickled mustard seeds, and if it's a Sunday or Monday, the famous fried chicken will be making an appearance on many plates. Plump fried green tomatoes and thick pork chops are on order, but for a true down-home taste, get a tall wedge of hummingbird cake, fragrant with banana and pineapple and slathered in cream cheese frosting.",0,0
1226,Chicago q,Barbecue,2,"American barbecue is anything but honky tonk in this gorgeous Gold Coast setting. Everything within the bright, bi-level space seems to gleam, from the colossal contemporary light fixtures and sun-splashed skylights to the shimmering open kitchen and myriad bottles of whiskey at the bar. Elegant preparations elevate traditional barbecue elements, like a spicy pairing of cornmeal-dredged fried green tomatoes and habañero-glazed pork belly with red onion-mango relish. Baby back ribs-so tender they're practically falling off the bone-are served with a trio of house-made sauces for dipping and slathering. And pig lovers planning for a large party can order a whole pork shoulder carved tableside with a picnic-worthy spread of slaw, beans, and cornbread.",0,0
1227,Riva,Seafood,2,"If a stroll along Navy Pier works up an appetite, follow your nose (and stomach) past the Ferris wheel to Riva, a nautically themed escape from the carnival atmosphere. The upstairs dining room is a visual feast, with colorful murals above the open kitchen and sweeping lakeshore views; while a casual café downstairs serves drinks and light bites. Though the menu swims with seafood, Prime steaks and Italian-inspired dishes like pear-and-cheese agnolotti offer variety. Caper-studded Louis sauce augments a single plump cake of jumbo lump crab with a crisp side of Asian slaw. A fillet of Atlantic salmon is placed atop a vibrant plate and paired with cherry tomato fondue, a handful of quartered Brussels sprouts, and bite-sized potato gnocchetti.",0,0
1228,Coalfire Pizza,Pizza,1,"Sure, you could come for a salad, but the focus here is on pizza-and yours should be, too. The cozy room features an open kitchen where pie production is on display for all to see. And in a playful bit of recycling, empty tomato sauce cans on each table become stands for sizzling pizzas churned straight from the 800-degree F coal oven. This hot spot has its ratio down to a fine art and knows not to burden its thin, crispy crust that's blackened and blistered in all the right places. The mortadella is a delight, with chopped garlic and gossamer slices of peppercorn-flecked sausage. Care to go your own way? Build the perfect pie with toppings that run the gamut from Gorgonzola to goat cheese. A second location in Lakeview continues to thrive.",0,0
1229,Chez Joël,French,2,"With tables covered in archetypal butcher's paper, butter-yellow walls, and red velvet window dressings, Chez Joël adds a touch of je ne sais quoi to Little Italy. The cozy, romantic setting is filled with expats and locals reliving memories of their trips to the City of Light. Taxidermied pheasants keep watch over the room from their high perches, like a Deyrolle curiosity. The kitchen gives classic French cuisine a soupçon of international embellishment. Three plump scallops spooned with basil pesto are set over a pool of tomato coulis for a Franco-Italian take on coquilles St. Jacques. A simple Caesar salad benefits from fresh ingredients like tender grilled chicken and crisp romaine lettuce in a garlicky dressing. Tasty pastas round out the menu.",0,0
1230,bellyQ,Asian,2,"This end of West Randolph Street might be quiet, but it's always a party inside bellyQ. The volume and energy are high throughout the lofty, concrete-heavy space with tabletop hibachi booths and industrial metal seating. A wall-length horse-themed screen separates the restaurant from casual sister spot Urban Belly, which shares the open kitchen. As imagined by prolific Chef/owner Bill Kim, the Asian barbecue experience at BellyQ takes its form in a number of genre-melding shareable plates. A side of bibimbap-style sticky rice is crunchy and tender, tossed with glistening slices of Chinese sausage and generously sprinkled with togarashi. Chewy chunks of brownie in vanilla soft-serve are drizzled with caramel-balsamic-soy ""Seoul sauce"" for a savory twist.",0,0
1231,Pump Room,American,2,"Back when the Public Hotel was known as the Ambassador East, scores of celebrities clinked glasses and forks in the Pump Room. Though these memories are preserved in black-and-white photos hung throughout the hotel, today the sunken dining room is a classy, updated space where cushy circular booths, mod orbital lights, and brown kraft paper placemats meld flawlessly. Under the direction of Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the seasonal American menu is as casually riveting as the décor. An amply sized boneless fried chicken breast is moist and flavorful beneath its shatteringly crisp coating, ready to sop up habanero-infused butter sauce. In an elegant sundae, handfuls of candied peanuts and caramel popcorn top three neat quenelles of salted caramel ice cream.",0,0
1232,Charlatan,Mediterranean,2,"Despite what its moniker might suggest, Charlatan is in fact a genuine and authentic show of talent. Hip and comfortable, this gastropub boasts whimsical toile and velvet details, a trio of mounted animal heads, and quality fare that puts the average pub grub to shame. The menu is anchored by a number of inventive pastas prepared in-house, like charred fennel-stuffed tortellini bobbing in a boldly seasoned porchetta brodo hit with fennel pollen and garlic-mustard oil. Unbelievably tender grilled octopus is plated with beef-braised carrots and fried bone marrow-enriched romesco; and the honeycomb-topped chocolate tart tastes as silky as a bowl of pudding. To make the most of your meal, wash it all down with a local brew or wine from a small producer.",0,0
1233,Acadia,Contemporary,3,"Dining here is like being let in on a secret, uncovered along this rather unfortunate strip of no-man's land. The unexpected yet grand space employs nothing but neutral grays that extend from the concrete façade to the cushioned chairs and silvery beads dividing the center of this lofty room in half. Service is gracious and professional-the kind we should all expect but is hard to find. Unusual and artful presentations may begin with canapés arriving in a box of moss or along a branch. Follow this with hamachi served as a brilliant study of flavor and balance, showcasing silky and beautifully marbled fish, placed on a bed of coconut-infused rice pudding with dabs of black garlic, bits of finger lime, and lemongrass-spiced chutney. Genius and luxury are at play in the sinfully rich Australian Wagyu beef, served red and fleshy with classic Bordelaise, roasted maitake to magnify the umami, chunks of sweet lobster, and lobster foam to lend an ocean-like airiness to the plate. Finish meals on a smooth and fudgy note with chocolate pudding cake accompanied by coconut gelée for striking visual contrast, a swipe of caramel, rum ice cream, candied black walnut, and toasty little slivers of fresh coconut.",2,1
1234,Old Jerusalem,Middle Eastern,1,"Set on a charming and centrally located stretch of Old Town, this family-run Middle Eastern favorite has been eagerly accommodating its happy customers for years. The menu focuses on Lebanese classics, such as tabbouleh with cracked wheat, scallions, and tomatoes, seasoned with lemon, olive oil, and plenty of crisp, green parsley. Hummus arrives rich with tahini, perhaps accompanying the likes of grilled chicken kebabs and traditional flatbreads. Finish with flaky-sweet baklava. While the décor may not impress, Old Jerusalem manages to make its well-worn look feel cozy and comfortable for everyone. Very reasonable prices, family-friendly service, and generous portions make this the neighborhood go-to, whether dining in or taking out.",0,0
1235,Three Aces,Gastropub,2,"Look past the fact that Three Aces is a bar-a hip, dimly-lit, rock n' roll-loving bar at that-and you'll find a soulful kitchen with a deft hand at turning out Italian riffs on American farm-to-table cuisine. Inventive combinations are the order of the day on both the food and cocktail lists; the Fiery Jalesco gets motors revving with a delicately smoky blend of mezcal, St. Germain, and grapefruit aromatics. Many dishes beg for sharing, like the Calabrese pizzetta that heats things up with spicy sausage and red chili flakes. Roast beef panini takes its cue from Chicago's famous Italian beef, its pressed sourdough slices are slathered with aïoli, packed to the gills with tangy giardiniera and provolone, and served with garlicky beef jus.",0,0
1236,County,Barbecue,1,"As its name implies, this urban 'cue joint celebrates barbecue in all its lip-smacking regional varieties. A flannel-lined wall stretches behind wooden tables set with an array of sauces for sampling, and beer and Bourbon take precedence on the drinks menu. Ensuring that no barbecue briquette goes unturned, the menu's spice rubs, brines, and smoking methods honor the regional styles of the Carolinas, west Texas, Kansas City, and Memphis. Take a gander at the nightly ""smokin' specials"" or choose from an already impressive lineup of slow-smoked ribs, wings, and other tasty bits. For extra impact, add a pile of tender pulled pork to a smoked bacon and fried green tomato sandwich-and order a slice of sensationally sweet pecan pie from Scafuri Bakery for dessert.",0,0
1237,Stax Café,American,1,"""We're Breakfast Geeks. We take this stuff way too seriously"" reads one of the server's T-shirts at Stax Café, and UIC students and staff are grateful for their dedication to heart-warming wake-up delights. From the coffee and fresh juice bar for on-the-go types, to flat-screen TVs for those dying to catch up on sports, this corner restaurant aims to get everyone's day started right. Breakfast items with tasty twists abound, like ricotta pancakes with strawberry-rhubarb compote; or the Spanish Harlem omelet served frittata-style with chorizo, roasted tomatoes, and poblano peppers. Can't choose? Get a side of mini waffles dusted with powdered sugar alongside your main dish, and don't forget to check out the chalkboards for specials-perhaps breakfast tacos?",0,0
1238,DeCOLORES,Mexican,2,"This family-owned Mexican restaurant in Pilsen's art district appropriately doubles as a gallery, with locals' works rotating frequently on the coffee-colored walls. If the pieces for sale don't strike a chord, just admire the bar's halting design of stylized metal branches snaking between shelves of colorful sugar skulls and paper flags. Recipes passed down through generations highlight fresh vegetables and healthy fare. The salsa with house-made corn chips as a starter changes every day, but each variety is a pleasure. Hominy stew with roast pork is traditionally garnished with shaved raw cabbage, radish, and red onion in pozole and then sprinkled with cucumber salsa for a fresh take; while boneless guajillo-marinated pork loin chops gain sweetness from grilled pineapple.",0,0
1239,Bascule Wine Bar,Contemporary,2,"Among the profusion of Italian-American standbys in Little Italy, Bascule emerges as a rustic and welcoming newcomer. Wide wood plank floors and a windowed façade open up the cozy space, flooding the length of the bar with light-and a semi-open kitchen turning out ambitious seasonal dishes emphasizes that this is much more than a wine bar. Quality ingredients and technique are on display in compositions like Indiana-farmed rabbit loin tucked with black pepper and glazed with blueberry and rhubarb demi-glace to balance sweetness and spice. Half portions let guests enjoy tastes of heady dishes like truffle cavatappi with cheddar crackling and roasted crumpled parsley. Stuffed? Order a slice of the olive oil cake for an ethereally light finale.",0,0
1240,Flo,Southwestern,1,"It's not Santa Fe, but the Southwest is well represented in West Town through the chili-packed flavors at Flo. This early meals joint cranks out a variety of spicy and tasty Tex-Mex dishes for diners crowded into the sunlight-dappled dining room. Pressed-tin ceilings, mirrors mounted on exposed brick, and narrow plank floors add quaint appeal. Made-to-order breakfast and brunch is served until 2:30 P.M., allowing ample time for Fruity Pebbles French toast or breakfast burritos. Pollo picante quesadillas get a kick from pickled jalapeños and Jack cheese. Sopapillas come in sweet as well as savory varieties like house-made chorizo with scrambled eggs and cheddar. As in the Southwest, fresh red or green chili is always offered as an option.",0,0
1241,Green Zebra,Vegetarian,2,"Named after a popular heirloom tomato variety, Chef/owner Shawn McClain's vegetarian standby is beloved among Chicagoans looking for an upscale meat-free experience. Japanese minimalism inspires the small space's décor, with palms and bamboo lining the entry and earthy tones throughout the room. Diners graze on shared small plates paired with organic and biodynamic wines. Creamy hen of the woods mushroom pâté, served with caramelized Vidalia onion marmalade and toasted bread, ensures that no one misses the meat. Peppery arugula purée and a dollop of crème fraîche balance silky celery root soup. Thin shards of dark chocolate and dense peanut mousse with currant coulis are a match made in vegan heaven; a crushed pretzel garnish gilds the lily.",0,0
1242,The Rosebud,Italian,2,"The Rosebud holds its own among the brass of University Village's Italian thoroughfare. The original location of what is now an extended family of restaurants throughout Chicagoland, it's nothing if not classic with its red neon sign, dark carved wood, and cool but accommodating all-male waitstaff. Italian wedding soup brings comfort with moist, tiny meatballs, escarole, and acini di pepe simmered in broth; while sweet sausage chunks, caramelized onions, and a garlicky white wine sauce make chicken giambotta a satisfying choice. Loyal clientele crowd around white tablecloths for platters of their favorite chicken parmesan or linguine topped with a mountain of clams. Also, dessert is not to be missed: a single slice of carrot cake will gratify the whole table.",0,0
1243,Mexique,Mexican,2,"Large groups fill most of the banquettes in this slender space, but a bar stretching half the length of the room makes it easy for smaller parties to stop in for a glass of sangria. A large rear window offers a glimpse of Chef Carlos Gaytan at work in the kitchen, and congratulatory graffiti from visiting chefs provides a fun distraction on the way to the restroom. Many of Mexique's contemporary Mexican dishes are inspired by classical French techniques. From the platos fuertes, the mar y tierra is a delightful composition of Michoacán-style braised pork belly over silken sweet potato purée dressed with a complex dark mole prepared from over 20 ingredients; sea scallop with bacon-apple jam and pickled onions complete this intoxicating one plate feast.",0,0
1244,Cai,Chinese,1,"Cai rolls out the red carpet for a lavish experience on the second floor of Chinatown Square, making it the local choice for celebratory seafood dinners or quick midday dim sum. The banquet hall-style room is grand and formal, complete with crystal chandeliers and professional service. To say there's a lot to choose from is an understatement, as there are nearly 100 rolled, crimped, steamed, and fried dim sum options alone. Highlights include flaky puff pastry turnovers filled with sweet and savory barbecue pork; and large lotus leaves that envelope tender sticky rice mixed with chicken, liver, and crab. When the dim sum parade ends at 4:00P.M., the menu shifts to an equally vast selection of Cantonese dishes like crunchy stir-fried lotus root with ginger.",0,0
1245,Frontier,American,2,"If Davy Crockett is king of the wild frontier, then chances are he'd be smitten by this stylish, modern-day saloon. To start, a taxidermied grizzly bear, wolf, and bison head hang among football-flaunting flat-screens behind the 40 foot-long bar. And even Frontier's menu drives home the hunt-and-gather theme, with dishes divided into three sections: ""Fried,"" ""Foraged,"" and ""Whole Animal Service."" Carnivores revel in the chef's signature duck tacos juiced with salsa verde, while pescetarians beg for crab Benedict-a superb staple of toasted muffins with sweet crabmeat, soft poached eggs, and spicy Hollandaise. Calorie-counters love the well-dressed house salad, but for dessert, there is no passing up on crispy sugar doughnuts-gently caressed with a rum-apple sauce in true Crockett fashion.",0,0
1246,Ruxbin,American,2,"Refurbished and repurposed is the rationale behind Ruxbin's funky décor. In the tiny first-floor space, salvaged apple juice crates form wall panels and seat belts become chair backs. Up a few stairs, a stainless steel communal table offers a view into the semi-open kitchen. Meals usually start with popcorn seasoned with changing flavors like sesame and seaweed-a preview of the menu's mix of American and international ingredients. A fresh oyster trio gets three distinct garnishes: sambal-pickled ginger, tangy apple mignonette, and pork belly with a smoked aroma revealed by lifting a glass cloche. Seared scallops and pork carnitas meld with black raisin emulsion. Rest easy that you won't miss the booze here after trying a house-made basil-hibiscus soda.",0,0
1247,Phoenix,Chinese,1,"Dim sum lovers get the best of both worlds at Phoenix, a comfortable room that boasts a grand view of the Chicago skyline. Here, stacks of bamboo baskets are wheeled to tables on signature silver trolleys for a classic dim sum experience-yet each diner's selection is cooked to order for truly fresh and steaming hot bites. The proof is in the soft and poppable shrimp-and-chive dumplings and the fluffy white buns stuffed with chunks of barbecue pork. Those looking for larger portions will appreciate the meandering menu, which also boasts Hong Kong-style stir-fry and clay pot dishes alongside Americanized Chinese classics. Fillets of steamed sea bass swim in soy oil on a large oval platter, sprinkled with a touch of slivered scallion to brighten the delicately flaky fish.",0,0
1248,Twin Anchors,Barbecue,2,"Within the brick walls that have housed Twin Anchors since 1932, generations have made their way across the checkerboard linoleum floor to throw a quarter in the jukebox and get saucy with a slab of their legendary ribs in one of the curved booths. Though the bar is wall-to-wall on weekends, most weekdays are low-key, with families and groups ready for a casual night out. Fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs are the real deal, made with a sweet and spicy rub, served with their own ""zesty"" sauce or the newer Prohibition version, with brown sugar and a hint of ghost-pepper heat. Classic sides like onion rings, baked beans, or hearty chili round out the meal. If there's a wait at this no-reservations spot, try the beer of the month while cooling your heels.",0,0
1249,Lao Sze Chuan,Chinese,1,"The news clips papering its front windows don't lie: this flagship branch of Tony Hu's mini-chain is a longtime Chinatown hot spot with a second outpost in Streeterville. But hot is a double entendre here, and a crimson-themed décor along with mod acrylic chairs printed with chili peppers clues guests in to the kitchen's propensity for spicing things up. If the book-length menu seems overwhelming, scan the list of favorites at the beginning for a quick pick-be sure to avoid any items marked with a chili if you'd rather walk on the mild side. As for the hits, chili oil and peppercorns give numbing heat to crunchy, translucent sheets of beef tendon, and succulent Xinjiang-style cumin lamb is generously coated in cumin seeds and tossed with fresh, zippy ginger.",0,0
1250,MingHin,Chinese,1,"Conveniently situated on the ground level of Chinatown Square, MingHin is a stylish standby that draws a diverse crowd to the neighborhood. Spacious dining rooms separated by wooden lattice panels offer seating for a number of occasions, from casual booths and large banquet-style rounds to specially outfitted tables for hot pots. Dim sum is a popular choice even on weekdays, with diners making selections from photographic menus rather than waiting for a passing cart. Among the numerous options, juicy har gao, stuffed with plump seasoned shrimp, always hit the spot. Pan-fried turnip cakes are simultaneously crispy and creamy, studded with bits of pork and mushroom, and fluffy, subtly sweet Malay steamed egg cake is a rare find for dessert.",0,0
1251,Ahjoomah's Apron,Korean,1,"Thanks to this modern, casual space, southside Chicagoans no longer need to head uptown for their fix of authentic Korean food. While there are no tabletop grills smoking up the dining room, the picnic-style tables fill quickly with generous portions of kitchen-grilled bulgogi, warming stews, and banchan. A crimson kimchi jjigae broth, seamlessly balanced between sour and spicy, bobs with soft chunks of tofu and pork. Bibimbap sizzles in a stone bowl, letting the requisite crispy crust form on the bottom while diners dig into a mountain of glistening sweet soy kalbi, crunchy vegetables, and fried egg. Want to feel virtuous about your meal? Wall posters tout the health benefits of traditional Korean ingredients like doenjang, an umami-rich soybean paste.",0,0
1252,Honky Tonk BBQ,Barbecue,2,"A rousing success since it opened in 2007, Honky Tonk BBQ serves up live music and award-winning Memphis-style treats on the southwest side of the city. Though the rollicking bar up front takes its cues from a swinging Wild West saloon, the rear dining room offers a more sedate-though still eclectic-setting for sipping house cocktails and chowing down on sensational smoked meats. You'll need two hands to hold homemade empanadas stuffed with combinations like Manchego cheese and shiitake mushrooms, and extra cottony white bread to soak up the juices of bone-in, wood-smoked chicken. Brisket chili is even more robust with a scoop of creamy mac and cheese-and if you're still hungry, soda floats with Bridgeport-made Filbert's root beer are the cherry on top.",0,0
1253,Balena,Italian,2,"Balena effortlessly blends rusticity and contemporary design in its prime Lincoln Park location. Lofty ceilings and industrial accents are a simple but statement-worthy juxtaposition against wooden floors and tables-and an appealingly inviting backdrop for a menu of inventive but solid takes on Italian cuisine. Knowledgeable, on-point service makes the meal even more divine. Start with a choice from the large vermouth selection and a round of burrata with pickled mustard seeds and fresh mint, ready to be piled on lardo-brushed toast. Or sink your teeth into wood-fired pizza with a parade of toppings like pistachio pesto and crisp mortadella. For dessert, brandy-soaked cherries add boozy warmth to caramel budino with salty-sweet praline crumble.",0,0
1254,Dusek's (Board & Beer),Gastropub,2,"Dusek's brings the party to Pilsen thanks to its palpable energy, groovy beats, and good-looking bar pouring an exceptional beverage program. Then consider the fact that the owners of Longman & Eagle are behind this operation and know that you're in for some seriously unique and outstanding eats. Housed in a booming, hipster-centric corner of the lower west side, this stylish public hall has major cool factor and enough real estate to be a triple threat. Framed by windows, the dining room is on the main floor while the upstairs (Thalia Hall) is a live music venue. Service throughout is very cordial, so settle in and await a spread of quirky American food. The menu changes daily so don't get hung up on favorites. However, smash-hits may include a wood-roasted cheese-stuffed pretzel coupled with wasabi dipping sauce as well as an ultra-decadent blue crab dip paired with artichoke relish and crusty, house-made pain d'epi. Live out your gourmet gastropub fantasy with slow-cooked salmon sporting a salty crust and spiced with salsa verde; or gnocchi tossed with lamb Bolognese and creamy ricotta. Portions should necessitate a doggie bag, but all the better to save room for an inventive fruit loop donut or even roasted chili churros with dulce de leche.",1,1
1255,Yuzu,Japanese,1,"Ancient and modern accents work in harmony at Yuzu, where hand-painted anime murals catch the eye above weathered plank wainscoting. A century-old wooden slab finds new life as a sushi counter, where diners sip sodas from Ball jars and groove to hip tunes. Whole ginger- and garlic-glazed grilled squid is sliced into rings, then sprinkled with scallions and creamy jalapeño sauce. Succulent robata-grilled skewers, purchased by the piece, arrive with specialized accompaniments like marinated pork shoulder with sweet chili sauce or kalbi-glazed short rib. The tobiko-topped Black Sea roll is one of a roster of quirky but manageably sized maki, all of which arrive with an artistic flourish-think intricate, paisley-patterned sauces painted onto plates.",0,0
1256,Perennial Virant,American,2,"Housed along tony Lincoln Avenue and packed with patrons to match, this Paul Virant operation is a ""perennial"" hit. Take the time to truly appreciate the philosophy followed at his haute farm-to-table spot, where local, sustainable cuisine combines with a minimalist décor featuring lush earth tones and chandeliers crafted from repurposed jars. Each ingredient-driven dish honors farmers and seasonality. Crisp pan-fried spaetzle, vivid green with mint, steals the show from a duo of mild but meaty lamb sausages, while a pickled pair of golden beets and diced onion provide a light, refreshing counterpoint to Arctic char. Chèvre ice cream rounds out an arrangement of velvety chocolate pavé, buttery graham cracker, salty-sweet caramel, and chewy coconut macarons.",0,0
1257,Alinea,Contemporary,4,"Who needs a meal followed by a show when you can have both together? That's because eating at Alinea, which involves around 20 courses over about three hours, is more than simply dinner-it's culinary theater. Perhaps it could qualify for a Tony Award along with its Michelin stars, because you're even invited backstage afterwards to meet the talented protagonists in the kitchen. Alinea provides such a vivid, visceral experience, that you'll even forget about the somewhat painful and entirely inhospitable booking procedure. Neophytes have nothing to fear here as there's a veritable army of charming, clued-up helpers and servers to guide you effortlessly through each and every dish. And guidance is certainly needed because the only menu you'll see is the one presented to you like an award certificate as you leave. The cooking is strikingly original and very clever. It can surprise but it can also challenge; at times dishes can be playful or even whimsical. But underpinning all those clever techniques and all those dazzling arrangements and quite striking presentations is an inherent understanding of flavor-and this is what gives the cooking such great depth.",3,1
1258,Boka,Contemporary,3,"Housed in an affluent part of town, find a small walkway that leads into this elaborate, handsome, and very sultry dining room. There are three different seating areas and each exudes class with a bit of romance, whimsy, and occasional quirk (note the escutcheon-covered doorway and capricious paintings). Against dark pebbled walls, find oversized horseshoe booths, long banquettes, and mirrored light bulbs casting funky shadows. The semi-outdoor solarium has a living wall of moss and ferns. Servers are friendly and genuine without a hint of pretense. This is the kind of place where one can sink in and not care to leave. Chef Lee Wolen's menu may be modern, but it is widely appealing with a Mediterranean edge. Begin with translucent slivers of fresh sea bass that get a pleasant chew from almond crumble and perfect flavor from a subtle dab of citrusy yuzu kosho. Then, deliciously tender and evenly pink Colorado lamb is served with a harmonious hodgepodge of creamy yogurt, charred lettuce, and nearly sweet baby potatoes. For dessert, an airy and whipped mound of praline-flavored mousse is set beside milk ice cream, which serves as a cooling counterpoint to the nutty flavors throughout and makes for a fine ending.",1,1
1259,Arami,Japanese,2,"Come to this bamboo-clad izakaya, with its comfortable sushi bar and soaring skylights, for impressively rendered small plates and specialty cocktails featuring Japanese spirits. The night's tsukemono can reveal spicy okra, crisp hearts of palm, and sweet burdock root, and the nigiri selection has showcased New Zealand King salmon topped with pickled wasabi root. The robata produces grilled maitakes with Japanese sea salt and black garlic purée; and gani korroke, a crunchy-creamy crab croquette, is plated with togarashi-spiked mayonnaise.

1260,The Blanchard,French,3,"In a minimalist but elegant space that complements its picturesque Lincoln Park environs, The Blanchard serves up sophistication with a side of well-executed French bistro food. Petite portions still satiate thanks to the richness of classic dishes like rillettes, duck à l'orange, and foie gras preparations. Escargots à la Bourguignonne start the meal on a luxurious note, with each of six plump curls sitting on a knob of mushroom duxelles and bathed in garlic butter, parsley, and breadcrumbs. Lightly caramelized capers and a brown butter sauce garnish two thin fillets of Dover sole meunière, with a streak of green pea tendril pommes purée alongside. Lush passion fruit curd and a sprinkle of lavender buds enhance a moist and chewy coconut financier.",0,0
1261,Connie's Pizza,Pizza,2,"No one knows who Connie was, but the name happened to be on the building bought by Jim Stolfe in 1963, and it stuck. Even Chicagoans who've never set foot in this spacious location know about its near-monopoly at White Sox games (including a complimentary shuttle to U.S. Cellular Field) and constant presence at citywide festivals. Those who do step inside the flagship come for the convivial vibe and, of course, pizza. Of the many options, the deep-dish is Miss Popularity, but it's fun to go one further with a stuffed pizza topped with a buttery crust. The garlic- and oregano-laced sauce is pleasantly tangy, and carnivores sing the praises of Connie's plump fennel sausage. Call ahead to forego the 45-minute cooking time and pick your pie up at the drive-thru.",0,0
1262,tocco,Italian,2,"Are we in Milan or Wicker Park? Tocco brings haute design and fashion to the table with such upscale textural touches as polished resin, faux ostrich skin, and bubblegum-pink accents in this sleek black-and-white space. Don your catwalk best before visiting: a fashion-centric display near a long communal table hints at the chichi theme present throughout. The décor is cutting-edge, but the menu respects and returns to Italian standbys. Gnocco fritto, a dough pillow served with charcuterie, is irresistible to even the most willowy fashionistas; while cracker-crisp artisan pizzas from wood-burning ovens are equally pleasing. Traditional involtini di pollo, pounded thin and rolled around prosciutto, gets a hit of brightness from lemon and white wine sauce.",0,0
1263,Bangers & Lace,Gastropub,2,"Despite the frilly connotations, this sausage-and-beer mecca's name refers not to doilies, but to the delicate layers of foam that remain in the glass after your craft brew has been quaffed. You'll also have lots of opportunity to study the lace curtains as you plow through their extensive draft beer menu, noted on blackboards in the comfortably worn-in front bar room. Decadent foie gras corn dogs (actually French garlic sausage wrapped with soft-sweet brioche cornbread) and veal brats with melted Gouda elevate the humble sausage; while a slew of sandwiches suit simpler tastes. Grilled cheese gilds the lily with taleggio, raclette, and Irish cheddar; and dreamy house-made chips drizzled with truffle oil and malt vinegar are more than a bar snack.",0,0
1264,Carriage House,Southern,2,"Carriage House brings South Carolina hospitality to the heart of Wicker Park. Gauzy shades cover large windows in the understated dining room. Wire cage light fixtures lend farmhouse flair; while bentwood bistro chairs and tufted leather ottomans add a contemporary touch. The menu mixes traditional dishes with modern interpretations for a North-South blend of flavor and technique. Velvety Charleston she-crab soup is poured tableside over bright orange roe that bursts in the mouth. A scrumptious house-made garlic bologna- and pimento cheese-sandwich on brioche bridges the worlds of fine dining and country charm. Family-style suppers like a low-country boil with shrimp, clams, and rabbit chaurice sausage are meant to be shared around a table of friends.",0,0
1265,Nuevo Léon,Mexican,1,"Nuevo Leon's colorful trompe l'oeil exterior is almost as loud as the din inside this family favorite in the heart of Pilsen. A jukebox competes with the chatter as it blasts Mexican tunes throughout multiple dining rooms, bouncing off clay tile floors and rattling the hand-painted plates on festive yellow walls. The crowds come for large portions of straightforward Mexican favorites like slabs of carne asada with warm corn tortillas to wrap the lightly seasoned meat and beans. Munch on a complimentary beef-and-potato soft taco while poring over the extensive menu. Sizzling platters arrive in a heartbeat once the order's been placed. Just add summery tomato salsa or taqueria-style pickled carrots and jalapeños to give each bite a bit more zing.",0,0
1266,Black Bull,Spanish,1,"Like bulls, hungry foodies are drawn to the color red-at least that's what the thinking must be at this chic tapas spot dominated by a neon bull and candy-apple exterior. Inside, glasses of crimson and rosé sangria are in everyone's hands, helping the noise skyrocket as the night wears on. Look at the colorful chalk-drawn mural above the kitchen, depicting Spanish scenes, products, and food terms, to get a sense of what's on offer. Shareable plates mix tradition with contemporary twists, like crispy hollowed-out patatas bravas filled with ketchup and aïoli. A half-dozen pickled mussels arrive in a tin beneath a layer of creamy potato foam; while an excellent consommé poured over a farm egg yolk and truffles is brightened by a dash of manzanilla sherry.",0,0
1267,Pl-zeň,Gastropub,2,"The beckoning tentacles of an enormous octopus painted on a brownstone point the way to this quirky subterranean spot. More murals lead diners down a brick-lined alley and into the dining room, where the dim space is lightened by blonde wood bar stools and a hospitable vibe from the cool young staff. Though both chilaquiles and sesame-crusted tilapia tacos find their way on to the menu, Pl-zenˇ offers a full slate of gastropub fare that steps away from the traditional Mexican bent of the neighborhood. Raisin- and pignoli-studded boar meatballs are simmered in tomato sauce and finished with ricotta and caramelized onions. A poached egg adds richness to crispy pig ear salad with Fresno chili aïoli. Cinnamon-sugar beignets deserve a dip in luscious strawberry-pinot grigio sauce.",0,0
1268,Mott St.,Fusion,2,"New Yorkers know Mott St. as the bustling artery in the heart of Chinatown, but to Chicagoans the name connotes something off the beaten path. Inside the low-slung, standalone red structure, a chicken wire-caged pantry is stocked with jars of red pepper, black vinegar, and other pungent edibles-all of which appear again in the food on your plate. Offerings at this hip haven crisscross the globe, melding diverse ingredients for an utterly unique dining experience. Shredded kohlrabi substitutes green papaya for a Thai-inspired salad tossed with candied shrimp, poached chicken, and plenty of fresh herbs. Stuffed cabbage bears a Korean accent with tender chunks of slow-braised pork, tangy Napa cabbage kimchi, and crunchy sticky rice.",0,0
1269,Mana Food Bar,Vegetarian,1,"Feeling like your body needs a jump-start? Mana, whose name translates to ""the life force coursing through nature,"" is a good place to get your mojo back. Though welcoming to vegans, vegetarians, gluten-free diners, and anyone who's looking for a nutrient boost, it's not just health food: the small space also offers a full bar with sake cocktails, smoothies, and freshly squeezed juices. Mana may be a tiny spot, but its diverse menu of vegetarian dishes is big on taste-and spice. Korean bibimbap mixes a roster of vegetables like pea pods, roasted carrots, and pickled daikon with a fresh sunny side-up egg; while horseradish and cracked black pepper sneak into macaroni and cheese. House-made hot sauce with serranos and jalapeños adds extra pep to any dish.",0,0
1270,Kokopelli,Mexican,1,"This Wicker Park taqueria is the next best thing to a getaway from the shores of Lake Michigan to the Pacific Coast of Mexico. Sure, it's north of the border, but the cooking is as authentic as it gets. Inside, the space is warm and comfortable with bar seating aplenty, bright green banquettes, and an accent wall painted a shade that can only be described as Baja blue. Seafood is the focus of the unique menu, and octopus reigns supreme. The eight-armed delicacy works its way into a number of items including pulpo ceviche and the Kraken taco, which features a grilled, pesto-marinated version. Equally excellent are the poblano tacos stuffed with smoked rainbow trout, charred corn, and a creamy salsa made from roasted pumpkin seeds and Serrano chiles.",0,0
1271,Smoke Daddy,American,1,"After a renovation doubled the size of this barbecue joint and live music venue, it's become easier to grab a bite of burnt ends and a touch of the blues. The original room still oozes soul and smoke from its brick walls and vinyl floor, while the new space is bright and airy with a retractable glass door leading to an umbrella-shaded patio. No matter which barbecue style you pledge allegiance to-Kansas City, Memphis, or Carolina-you'll find something worth gnawing on, from moist pulled pork and chicken to spare and baby back ribs. Order any sandwich ""Daddy Style"" to get a few slices of brisket slapped on top, or fill up on jalapeño cornbread. Fans of the in-house Bloody Mary mix should grab a bottle to-go, along with smoked pig ears in a true doggy bag.",0,0
1272,Summer House Santa Monica,American,2,"Sunny days and southern California come to Lincoln Park in the form of this bright and breezy restaurant that resembles a beach house, albeit an enormous one with lots of house guests. It's the perfect choice for a summer's day-and not a bad one in the colder months, either if you're having a quick bite before the theater or want to shake off those winter blues for a while. There's even a countdown showing the number of days till summer. The menu proves a good fit for the surroundings by keeping things easy. There are sandwiches, tacos, and salads, but it's the meat and fish from the wood-fired oven that stand out. For dessert, choose a big cookie from the counter by the entrance. There's also a pizza restaurant and bar attached.",0,0
1273,Briciola,Italian,2,"After decades of cooking and traveling, Chef/owner Mario Maggi was ready to open a small place-just a crumb, or ""una briciola,"" of a restaurant. This tiny trattoria nestled between Ukrainian Village's brick buildings is indeed a speck of warmth and charm, festooned with party lights on the patio and mustard-toned walls inside. Traditional Italian cuisine gets personalized tweaks from the chef. Carpacci may include paper-thin octopus, beets, or beef; macaroncini alla Briciola folds diced Tuscan sausage into a spicy garlic-sage sauce; and a hefty bone-in pork chop, pounded thin, breaded, and pan-fried until golden, is a house classic dressed with arugula and shaved parmesan. A bottle from the wine shop down the block makes the meal even more convivial.",0,0
1274,Ada St.,Contemporary,2,"Despite its obscure location among the industrial warehouses of far-east Wicker Park, adventurous diners have no trouble seeking out Ada St. Reservations aren't accepted after 6:30 P.M., so the cozy, brick-walled lounge quickly becomes a party space where patrons peruse the wooden cubbies of vinyl to create their own soundtrack. The menu of small plates is influenced by both hearty gastropub dishes and lighter Mediterranean bites. Tabasco mash ketchup heats up a plate of charred, tender octopus, while a poached egg gilds rich duck confit tossed with cavatelli. Even the snappy green beans need nothing more than Dijon butter to shine. Before you take off, show your appreciation by choosing the last item on the menu: a six-pack of beer for the kitchen staff.",0,0
1275,Schwa,Contemporary,4,"There comes a point when pared-down style jumps from being easy-to-miss and becomes hard-to-forget (think security grills on the façade). When a utilitarian and self-consciously bare interior seems modern and industrial. When temporarily disconnected phone lines and full mailboxes make every hipster in the room feel like he hit the jackpot to score this reservation. The booming hip-hop peppered with expletives reflects the deeply talented chefs' ethos, going well beyond laissez-faire to reach the point of ""we don't give a damn."" That said, you probably won't either. The food really is that good. The 14-course nightly tasting has no menu really to speak of, but there are plenty of tattooed servers ready to describe each dish with details that come at you rapid fire. While some courses may seem way out of balance in terms of flavor and textural complexity, others have been known to show nuance and delicacy-as evident in the smooth and fine Osetra caviar sitting in a mélange of cashew nut purée, tender hearts of palm, and fried plantain chips; or a single quail egg raviolo with its glossy and unctuous brown butter sauce. Desserts can be pure genius, beginning with watermelon ice and unagi ice cream-a sprinkle of togarashi perfectly foils the intensity of this treat.",1,1
1276,Taus Authentic,International,2,"You'll want to make an evening of it at this Wicker Park newcomer, where a stylish front lounge-complete with a working fireplace-makes for a cozy spot to enjoy a beer or cocktail. Then you may proceed to linger over a meal in the beautiful dining room, a modern vision of wood, powder blue velvet, and plate glass windows. Chef Michael Taus has designed a menu made for grazing: think charcuterie, cheese, and starters including a sunchoke dosa. Made from lentils and basmati rice, this lacy crêpe is topped with chunks of tender sunchokes in a spicy red curry sauce sweetened by golden raisins and candied pumpkin seeds. A tasting portion of pan-seared fluke, plated with sweet chili vinaigrette and a Korean-style pancake studded with dried shrimp, is equally delicious.",0,0
1277,Gemini Bistro,American,2,"Opposites attract at this delightful neighborhood bistro that offers the best of both worlds: a chic, upscale setting with a casual, approachable attitude. Dark Venetian blinds and awnings remove outside distractions, letting guests focus their attention on the white marble bar and the lychee martinis shaken there. Most street parking in the area is permit only, so consider the valet. Seasonal American cooking pulls inspiration from the Mediterranean in dishes like plump double-boned pork chop Lyonnaise, cooked to a juicy medium, draped in herbed demi-glace, and nestled with cipollini onions and roasted fingerling potatoes. Smaller bites like a trio of seared scallops are paired with the timeless flavors of brown butter, capers, and lemon zest.",0,0
1278,Antique Taco,Mexican,1,"No reservations and walk-up counter service lead to an inevitable wait at Antique Taco (wear comfortable shoes). Ease the pain by browsing well-curated racks of knickknacks while awaiting market-fresh Mexican food, which arrives on abuela-worthy china plates. Place your order and score a wooden stool at a boxy plank table. Antique Taco piles its corn tortillas with substantial and delicious fillings. Crispy battered fish is spiced up with sriracha-tartar sauce and chilled smoked cabbage slaw. Shredded roast pork is rubbed with adobo, glazed in tamarind, and joined with creamy avocado and queso fresco for tasty carnitas. Pickled red onions add punch to chunky guacamole. Vodka-spiked agua frescas are nice, but the horchata milkshake is unmissable.",0,0
1279,Riccardo Trattoria,Italian,2,"The timeless wood-and-cream décor doesn't resemble an Italian nonna's kitchen, but no matter-the soulful personality of Chef/owner Riccardo Michi and his cache of family recipes make his eponymous restaurant a second home to nearly half the neighborhood. It's a spot that's suited for flirty date nights, boisterous dinners, and every occasion in between. As befits the word ""trattoria,"" rustic Italian preparations take precedence, but the simplicity satisfies. Chunks of pork sausage add heft to a heaping bowl of hand-rolled cavatelli bathed in a light tomato cream sauce, and curls of grilled calamari need only a squirt of lemon, splash of olive oil, and sprinkle of parsley to sing. For dessert, a thin, buttery tart shell cradles tender wine-poached pears.",0,0
1280,Oiistar,Asian,1,"It's easy to mistake Oiistar for yet another trendy ramen joint-but don't. Sure, it's got all the design hallmarks-from a minimalist wood-planked dining room and industrial open kitchen, to a turned-up soundtrack. But, the internationally influenced menu makes it much more than your average slurp shop. In fact, ""It's A Small World"" could be the unofficial theme song for their lineup of steamed buns and comforting ramen bowls showcasing noodles hand-pulled in-house each day: fiery kochujang complements barbecue chicken on the pollo bun, while the saltimbocca bun goes Italian with sage, prosciutto, and mozzarella. Extra special is the chadolmen, which blends a tangle of delicate wheat noodles with brisket and ground pork in a spicy miso and kimchi broth.",0,0
1281,Cumin,Indian,1,"This proudly-run blend of Nepalese and Indian eats sits among a plethora of bars, coffee shops, and vintage stores in boho-centric Bucktown. While fans of the sub-continent love Cumin for its clean and modern surrounds, linen-lined tables struggle to contain the myriad plates that pile up during its ubiquitous lunch buffet. Paintings of mountain scenes decorate crimson-red walls and prep diners for an authentic range of flavorful food hailing from the Northeast. Nibble on crispy samosas or onion bhajis (finely shredded onion fritters) teamed with mint chutney. Then soak pieces of buttery naan in rich and vibrant saag bobbing with soft chunks of chicken. For a sweet finale, dig into a creamy pistachio kulfi or opt for a light and fruity mango lassi.",0,0
1282,Takito Kitchen,Mexican,2,"Chicago's upscale taco circuit gets a new contender with Takito, where fresh ingredients make Latin-inspired food sing. Tequila takes pride of place in a chile-salted margarita, while skylights and mirrors make the narrow, mod-industrial space seem even brighter and larger. Sure, you can get a corn tortilla here, but sesame and hibiscus options let the kitchen get creative as evident in tacos filled with cornmeal-crusted redfish, beef barbacoa, or tamarind-chayote pequin. Shared plates like sope de carne asada blur culinary boundaries with the addition of Brunkow cheddar and green onion kimchi. It's an across-the-board mishmash of colorful flavors, but certainly a good way to go over the top. Sister spot Bar Takito also boasts a notably concise menu.",0,0
1283,Greentea,Japanese,2,"Regulars would rather your eyes glaze past Greentea's nondescript storefront so they can keep this secret to themselves. The bento box-sized room isn't glitzy, so the scene is limited to a few lucky cat sculptures and plants to punctuate the seafoam green walls. Otherwise, the focus is kept on the itamae in colorful chef's coats and the pristinely fresh seafood they're preparing. Purists love the well-priced nigiri, sashimi, and manageably sized rolls showcasing silky hamachi or glistening uni with a touch of minerality. Tiger Eyes salad is a visual showstopper: squid stuffed with smoked salmon, julienned cucumber, and marinated carrots sliced into thin rounds are a clever and flavorful resemblance to an orange-pupiled eye.",0,0
1284,Mirai,Japanese,2,"Mirai is a bit like Disney World. You know it's not real, but who cares? The Japanese food is westernized and by no means traditional, but unless you're dining out with Mr. Shinzo Abe, rest assured that nobody will cry foul. Bold and appetizing flavors beg to take center stage. It's really all about the fish at this spot-just look around and you'll find most devotees feasting on sashimi, unagi, and maki. If raw fish doesn't float your boat, take a shot at one of the house specialties like kani nigiri, a baked king crab concoction. There is also a surfeit of hot dishes-think chicken togarashi with spicy, sweet, and tangy flavors. Affable and alert service combined with a relaxed atmosphere make this a hit among area residents.",0,0
1285,Aquitaine,American,2,"When Lincoln Park locals want French-inspired cuisine, they head to Aquitaine for a taste of Chef/owner Holly Willoughby's refined cooking. Dim lighting and subtle brocade details on the walls keep the long, narrow dining room casually romantic, with enough simple sophistication to swing a Saturday night date or weekday post-work dinner. A well-priced wine list only adds to the elegant appeal. Large chunks of succulent lobster are a luxe touch in a ramekin of tender potato gnocchi bathed in creamy sauce. Eggplant, olive, and tomato relish give double-cut lamb chops a Provençal spin, heightened by a drizzle of basil pesto. Textbook-perfect crème brûlée needs only a tap of the spoon to send its delicate sugar crust splintering into the silken custard.",0,0
1286,Mon Ami Gabi,French,2,"A real French bistro can give an American steakhouse a run for its money in the meat department any day, and the 11 different steak preparations on Mon Ami Gabi's menu (all served with crispy golden frites) are justly impressive. Beyond the butcher case, a selection of satisfying Francophile classics keeps the sophisticated Chicago contingent returning to this cozy, stylish standby. Tradition reigns in the kitchen, where the emphasis is on flavorful and unpretentious dishes like seafood pot-au-feu bobbing with scallops and pepper-crusted cod fillet in a tasty fennel broth. Pickled cornichons and warm toast points make a meal out of house-made country pâté. And for an indulgent finish, split a plate of warm caramel-drizzled pineapple crêpes.",0,0
1287,Nando Milano Trattoria,Italian,2,"A corner bar television constantly tuned to (European) football, vintage aperitivo posters, and a welcoming patio tailor-made for afternoon glasses of prosecco: charismatic host Dario Vullo has installed his own little slice of Milan in Wicker Park. The chic trattoria offers an intensely Italian menu and wine list to match the authentic accents of Vullo and family. A trio of arancini are playfully prepared, with each rice ball sporting a unique shape-sphere, triangle, and cube-to denote a special filling like Bolognese ragù and smoked mozzarella; or mascarpone and spinach. House-made pastas like beet gnocchi in saffron sauce steal the show from equally flavorful and fresh focaccia sandwiches layered with creamy burrata and Prosciutto di Parma.",0,0
1288,Las Palmas,Mexican,2,"Vivid décor complements the spirited flavors on the menu at Las Palmas, from the colorful Mexican artwork on adobe-style walls to exposed ductwork welded to resemble a scaly dragon winding through the deceptively large space. If the weather suits, the outdoor garden or glassed-in atrium beckon; if not, a cozy fireplace in the front room keeps things intimate. The cocktail menu draws inspiration from both South and Central America, featuring a variety of capirinhas and mojitos alongside inventive cucumber-lime and pineapple margaritas. Vibrant and modern Mexican dishes like crispy taquitos with chicken barbacoa, pickled red onion, and tangy salsa cruda; as well as seafood-filled cornmeal empanadas with peanut-jalapeño relish showcase the kitchen's flair.",0,0
1289,Lillie's Q,Barbecue,2,"Bucktown's urban barbecue shack takes a scholarly approach to 'cue, as each table bears a caddy stocked with six regionally specific sauces for embellishing the slow-smoked meats to come. Cocktails served in Mason jars are a specialty made from ""moonshine"" offered at three proof levels, and servers in modern mechanic's shirts tend to the crowds clamoring for heaps of smoked meats rubbed in ""Carolina dirt."" Tri-tip is tender and pink-tinged after its time in the smoker with the joint's signature dry rub; while the succulent smoked hot link rests in a butter-griddled, top-sliced brioche bun served with Southern-style coleslaw. And if at-home grilling is your thing, you'll be pleased to know that the mouthwatering sauces are available by mail order.",0,0
1290,Rickshaw Republic,Indonesian,1,"The captivating flavors of Southeast Asian street food are matched by the creative design at this friendly, family-run Lincoln Avenue space. Color and pattern collide as parasols, puppets, and bird cages vie for attention with abstract Indonesian wood carvings. Once the food arrives, though, the spotlight shifts to the aromatic plates. Start with crisp martabak crêpes that behold a savory combination of beef, onions, and egg. Then move on to lemongrass-braised chicken thighs in a turmeric-tinged coconut curry with sweet and spicy tamarind sambal and pickled cabbage. Surprise your palate with es cendol, a mix of coconut milk and green pandan jelly in palm sugar syrup. Finally, take one of Mama Setiawan's homemade sambals home to bring color to your cooking.",0,0
1291,Big Star,Mexican,1,"Bucktown's favorite taqueria has all the fixings for a fiesta. Craft beers, custom-bottled Bourbons, and pitchers of margaritas wash down the affordable abundance. And, despite the grungy décor, the vibe is as intoxicating as the aroma of the taco de chorizo verde. The patio is even more of a party, and sun-starved Chicagoans can be spotted out there soon after the groundhog has (or hasn't) seen his shadow. Tacos are served individually, thus allowing ample opportunity to graze on the likes of the pollo pibil-achiote- and citrus-marinated chicken thighs steamed in banana leaves, topped with pickled onion slices and cilantro. Save room for the salsa de frijole con queso, a crock of pinto bean dip accompanied by lime salt-sprinkled tortilla chips.",0,0
1292,Taxim,Greek,2,"Though Taxim channels the spirit of Greece in its food, the Moroccan-esque décor takes inspiration from Turkey and other Mediterranean coastal neighbors. The large room glints with light from hanging Moorish lanterns and copper-topped tables. Share small plates on the sidewalk patio to take full advantage of Wicker Park people-watching. Many of Taxim's dishes get a modern twist while remaining respectful to the islands' traditional cuisine. Wild Greek oregano and ouzo-preserved lemon offer a perfect balance to roasted Amish Miller Farms chicken; while loukoumades prove that no one can resist fried dough, especially when tossed in wildflower honey and topped with rosewater-infused pastry cream. The all-Greek wine list is an adventure for oenophiles.",0,0
1293,Dove's Luncheonette,American,2,"With a chill, throwback vibe, all-day breakfast, and a drink list with more than 70 labels of agave spirits, this One Off Hospitality roadhouse is a Wicker Park hipster's dream come true. To drive the point home, the diner features wood-paneled walls, counter seating, a record player spinning the blues, and of course, Tex-Mex fare listed on a wall-mounted letter board. The daily special may be a blueberry quinoa pancake, while savory favorites include crunchy buttermilk fried chicken with chorizo verde gravy or the farmer's cheese-stuffed Anaheim chile relleno, served in a pool of tomato-serrano sauce with pasilla chiles and pickled chayote slices. Pies from Hoosier Mama Pie Co. are a grand finale; try the lemony Atlantic Beach with a saltine crust.",0,0
1294,White Oak Tavern & Inn,American,2,"Though there was a late summer (2015) transition in chefs, a creative sense of flavor combinations and technical finesse continue to flourish at this appealingly rustic restaurant and inn. Midwestern hospitality and bounty are at the forefront here, and every ingredient on each section of the multi-category menu is of irreprehensible quality. The in-house cheese-making and bread programs are on full display as evidenced in a bowl of stracciatella, where mozzarella mingles with pickled shallot rings next to fluffy, griddled focaccia sticks. A whiff of smoke uplifts moist, meaty sturgeon, simply seared and surrounded by candied hickory nuts and nutty crème fraîche; while a refined and clever root vegetable tartare is deliciously crowned by a sous vide duck egg.",0,0
1295,Enso,Japanese,2,"All bases are covered at Enso, from tempura to ramen and chirashi to teriyaki, but it's mostly about maki. There are fairly classic combinations of ingredients on offer, but also more challenging blends of flavor. If you can't decide then you can always ""make your own maki""-but you'll only have yourself to blame should the memory of your chosen flavors return to haunt you at a later date. The homemade steamed buns are also worthy; a filling of roasted pork belly with pickled vegetables inside one of these little pillows of delight is hard to beat. The vaulted room looks like a Goth's cellar, all black and moody, with the open kitchen at the far end shining like a beacon of hope. Larger parties should try to snare one of the low-slung booths.",0,0
1296,The Duck Inn,American,2,"Grab a taxi and head to the warehouses of Bridgeport, where this stylish, modern tavern-from neighborhood native Kevin Hickey-feels like a diamond in the rough. Through a set of French doors, the hubbub brought on by intricate cocktails in the retro globe-lit lounge leads to a decorous dining room with wide wooden tables and curvy midcentury seating. Beyond the kitchen's signature rotisserie duck for two, the menu spreads its wings with a focused but diverse selection of small plates and entrées. Briny sea beans are the crowning touch to a winning dish of uni butter-slathered spot prawns and creamy risotto, while a duo of pickle- and beer-brined chicken thigh and drumstick glisten with a tableside finish of smoked paprika jus.",0,0
1297,Bourgeois Pig Cafe,Deli,1,"Scholarly types from nearby DePaul University adore this bookish café on a quiet block of Fullerton. Choose from a litany of salads, sandwiches, and drinks from oversized chalkboard menus behind the counter; then stake out one of the premium second-floor tables. Upstairs, chandeliers, cozy couches, and scattered antiques (not to mention frequent study groups guzzling caffeine and homemade cookies) lend character. Many sandwiches take names from literary works, like The Old Man and the Sea (tuna salad) or Catcher in the Rye (reuben). The muffuletta is a lightly pressed panini rendition of the New Orleans standard, stacking a deli's worth of ham, salami, mortadella, provolone, and mild giardiniera in fresh focaccia for a hearty yet delicate bite.",0,0
1298,Trenchermen,Contemporary,2,"In old-timey slang, a trencherman is a hearty eater and drinker, a definition that lets you know what you're in for at this glossy but comforting Wicker Park gastropub. Housed in a former Russian bathhouse, the black-and-white tiles and notched brick walls dividing the eclectic warren of rooms give a nod to the former tenant of this 1920s building. Bar snacks and weekend brunch are taken just as seriously as full-on lunch and dinner here. Corned beef adds a manly touch to eggs Benedict, especially when drizzled with piquant choron sauce. Dense pretzel cinnamon rolls straddle the salty-sweet line. A menu favorite at any time of day, fried pickle tots are served with kicky beet-tinged red onion yogurt and thinly sliced chicken breast bresaola.",0,0
1299,Fiesta Mexicana,Mexican,1,"Cheerful and bright, Fiesta Mexicana is truly a party for the eyes and tastebuds. High-ceilinged rooms are lined with colorful murals of small-town life, and wide-open front windows invite in warm evening breezes. Live mariachi bands turn up the heat on weekends. Creative Mexican fare begins with the usual suspects like tacos al pastor and piquant, spunky house-made salsa, but unique dishes broaden the offerings. Here, a bowl of fundido is a Latin cousin to spinach-and-artichoke dip, with a blend of tangy cheeses and plenty of roasted poblanos for extra heat. Pan-fried pork tenderloin medallions come smothered in tomatillo sauce alongside drunken beans, bacon-wrapped shrimp, and a side of smashed red potatoes with oozing Chihuahua cheese.",0,0
1300,Mindy's Hot Chocolate,Contemporary,2,"Bucktown wouldn't be the same without this sweet spot run by pastry chef extraordinaire, Mindy Segal. Diners walk past decadent hot chocolate mix and cookies on display before hitting an industrial-chic space fitted out with sleek dark wood, caramel-brown walls, and chocolate-toned leather banquettes. Get the point yet? Decadent chocolate is the name of the game here, though guests will be delighted to discover savory items beyond their expectations. Try the roasted tomato soup, garnished with bright green onion slivers; or the BLT with pesto aïoli, heirloom tomato, avocado, and thick, crispy maple-cayenne bacon. An affogato-a scoop of coffee-cocoa nib ice cream paired with the chef's namesake hot chocolate-makes for the perfect finale.",0,0
1301,EL Ideas,Contemporary,4,"Free your mind, keep your expectations high, and ignore the hand-made sign and desolate locale that make this undeniably edgy restaurant feel like a David Lynch movie. No one comes here for high-end pampering. Rather, the interior is an amalgam of heavy wood timber, zinc ductwork, abstract art, and a homespun curtain made of wine corks. The open kitchen and its team of freewheeling anti-heroes lend a dinner-party vibe, with guests bringing bottles of Bourbon as gifts for the chefs and others getting up to mingle. Woe to those who come here to dine alone. This prix-fixe is an all-embracive antithesis to highfalutin fine dining, with courses that the chef might describe as salty-sweet stoner food. Envision golden-fried potatoes in a piping hot leek soup, topped with liquid nitrogen-prepared vanilla ice cream that pops and crackles when poured overtop. The result is a brilliant playfulness that hits all the right gustatory notes. Seared venison may arrive with plump morels, jicama brunoise, beluga lentils, and wonderfully bright green garlic ""slaw."" Flavor, texture, and presentation reach their height in the chartreuse cake with candied fennel, wild huckleberries, and white chocolate crémeux.",1,1
1302,Pequod's Pizza,Pizza,1,"Ditch your diet, grab your fellow Blackhawks fans, and head to this Lincoln Park stalwart for some of the best pies in town. Christened for Captain Ahab's sailing ship, Pequod's menu promises smooth sailing for sports bar noshers, featuring a lineup of shareable bar snacks such as wings and mozzarella sticks, hearty sandwiches like tender Italian beef, and both thin-crust and deep-dish pan pizzas. Grab that cutlery before digging into the buttery crust of each deep-dish pie, ringed with blackened cheese at the edges. Then toppings like pepperoni, fresh garlic, and crunchy sautéed onions are generously layered between tart tomato sauce and handfuls of cheese for an oozy jumble in every bite. A towering wedge of fudge cake awaits those with room for dessert.",0,0
1303,de Quay,Fusion,2,"Given its history as a former colony, the Dutch have developed a great deal of appreciation for Indonesian culinary tradtions. And, Chef/owner David de Quay pulls from his family heritage to bring the two together at his eponymous restaurant. Delft pottery houses and sleek teak wood wall accents are visual mementos of this union. On the menu, sweet-and-sour babi panggang departs from its traditional pairing with roast pork to heighten succulent grilled shrimp and fragrant lemongrass lumpia. Crisp-edged dumplings enclose a creamy potato-and-Gouda filling that is studded with bacon and English peas. Chewy house-made stroopwafels sandwich warm spiced caramel with vanilla bean-flecked ice cream for an unforgettable finis.",0,0
1304,Kai Zan,Japanese,2,"A recent expansion has doubled the space of Kai Zan's tiny empire on far western Chicago Avenue, adding multi-rooms of wooden tables and benches next to the original sliver of a marble sushi counter. Make a reservation to guarantee a spot at the counter, where it's a pleasure to watch chefs and twin brothers Melvin and Carlo Vizconde work in synchronicity. Though known for its sushi, grilled items like juicy beef tongue complement the roster of exceptionally fresh bites. Smoky seared saba and octopus sashimi are served with typically restrained seasoning, needing nothing more than a dab of soy and dip in pickled wasabi sauce. Monthly specials may include Eskimo clouds, a poetic name for escolar-wrapped kushi oysters with Tabasco-ponzu foam.",0,0
1305,Han 202,Asian,2,"In a neighborhood dominated by sports bars and Irish pubs, Han 202 stands apart as a sophisticated pan-Asian alternative for White Sox watchers. Bare wood tables and high-backed coffee-and-cream leather seats convey polish-an attitude reinforced by the skilled chefs and servers. Dramatic driftwood sculpture and framed art play against pale walls. The $35 four-course prix-fixe menu is a true bargain, with each course punctuated by precisely cut fresh bites of sushi. Jeju Island hirame is lightly brushed with mirin and kissed with wasabi. Lobster tail arrives warm and buttery with a dollop of fresh ricotta and tender red beet halves, drizzled with olive oil. Seared duck breast adds juicy flavor to standard steamed vegetables in a fermented bean sauce.",0,0
1306,Birchwood Kitchen,American,1,"Every neighborhood needs a spot like this, where one can order a bowl of turkey chili followed by sourdough waffles simply because the mood strikes. (Speaking of the chili, it's perfectly spicy and studded with white beans, and those waffles arrive with vanilla bean butter and warm maple syrup.) The vibe here is enhanced by service that charms, and the team goes beyond mere smiles to engage with diners, even offering a cup of coffee for the road to help defend against winter's icy blast. This ""Kitchen's"" periwinkle façade stands out like a gem. Inside, a refrigerated glass case displays lemon bars, chocolate chip-banana bread, and other goodies to-go. And, the low-key crowd seated along old church pews lining exposed brick walls, are loyal for good reason.",0,0
1307,En Hakkore,Korean,1,"Healthy doesn't have to be humdrum. This simple little Korean eatery, run by a husband-and-wife team and decorated with more than a hint of whimsy, specializes in big bowls of bibimbap. You choose your rice and protein, be it pork or barbecue beef, decide on the heat level and then dive straight in-up to 16 different vegetables are used and they're as tasty as they are colorful. Also worth trying are the steamed mandoo (pork dumplings) and the curiously addictive tacos made with paratha. Simply place your order at the counter, grab a plastic fork and, if you're with friends, commandeer the large communal table. There's no alcohol (and it's not BYOB) so instead take advantage of an invigorating soft drink from the fridge. You'll feel so virtuous.",0,0
1308,Frances' Deli,Deli,1,"Frances' Deli is the type of quaint, lived-in diner everyone dreams of having just around the corner from home. Lucky Lincoln Park residents get that wish fulfilled at this authentic pre-war haunt packed with American antiques and memorabilia-where weekend waits are the norm as half the neighborhood vies for a place at one of the closely spaced tables. As with any good diner, breakfast, lunch, and dinner all know how to hit the spot. The deli roasts its own meats and does Jewish-American staples right, from flavorful, crisp-tender potato pancakes to oversized pastrami and brisket sandwiches with all the fixings (slaw, fries, and potato salad). As long as you're going for the full nostalgia trip, slurp down a made-to-order milkshake or malt.",0,0
1309,North Pond,Contemporary,3,"Sitting just north of the pond, this former warming house for ice skaters has been reconceived as a chic Craftsman-style cottage with windows overlooking the shimmering water. Flickering candles and wood accents make it feel like a remote forest lodge, and a quote from Chaucer over the wine rack enhances the overall historic feel. Both the reasonably priced à la carte and fixed menus appear simple, listing one or two main seasonal ingredients often repeated with new insight throughout a meal. However, each dish elevates farm-to-table cooking with creative exploration. This is at once clear in the ""egg, bacon,"" its velvety yolk ready to spill over and lushly sauce the roasted rapini, bacon confit, and dark slice of toasted pumpernickel beneath. This may be followed by pearly white fluke set over deep-green kale braised with bacon and paired with shards of crisped kale, juice-like kale foam, as well as bacon bits, purple potato slices, sweet apple balls, toasted hazelnuts, and a single, succulent Gulf shrimp. Finish with a quenelle of unique smoked olive oil sorbet paired with torn pieces of herbaceous rosemary cake, cinnamon-laced apple, spiced pecans, puffs of apple foam, and salt-pepper crumble. Then breathe a sigh of supreme satisfaction.",1,1
1310,Del Seoul,Korean,1,"Korean street food makes its way from the trendy trucks to a fast-casual space that gives the people what they crave. All the intoxicating flavors of Korean cuisine are here in finger food form, perfect for sharing or creating your own personal buffet. Choose from the video screens above the counter, take a number, and grab a seat. Bite-sized barbecue tacos are the star of the menu, filled with a variety of meats including kalbi-style braised beef short ribs or panko-breaded sesame-chili shrimp. Both get a topping of bright cilantro-onion slaw on grilled white corn tortillas. Canadian poutine crosses a number of borders when topped with more of those tender short ribs, house-made kimchi, pickled red onions, and a trio of melted cheddar, jack, and crema.",0,0
1311,Le Bouchon,French,2,"Pressed-tin ceiling? Check. Brick-and-Dijon color scheme? Check. Close-knit tables in a snug space? Check. A warm welcome from an actual Frenchman? Check. Owner Jean-Claude Poilevey has fashioned the quintessential bistro experience at Le Bouchon, where straightforward French food never goes out of style. The informal atmosphere gets convivially raucous as the night goes on with regulars lining the bar and petite dining room. Familiar, approachable favorites rule the menu: soupe à l'oignon, wearing its traditional topper of broiled Gruyère on a moist crouton, oozes and bubbles over the sides of a ramekin; and an ample fillet of saumon poché napped in beurre blanc is the essence of simplicity. A lunch prix-fixe keeps the wallet light but belly full.",0,0
1312,Homestyle Taste,Chinese,1,"For more adventurous fare than spicy Sichuan lamb or dim sum, look no further than this family-run favorite. Though the lengthy menu offers plenty of usual suspects (think scallion pancakes and mapo tofu), it's also chock-full of authentic Chinese dishes that will make any offal lover's day. Thin slices of lamb kidney are dry stir-fried, their mild flavor boosted by copious amounts of cumin and red chilies. Then, a sweet and sour sauce offsets the funky flavor of quick-fried intestine, tripe, and liver; and pickled cabbage and pork meatball soup, boosted by tofu and noodles, is a welcome warmer on cold days. The service is friendly and amenable, so don't be afraid to specify your preferred meat or ask for chili oil to amplify the heat quotient.",0,0
1313,Izakaya Mita,Japanese,1,"This Bucktown addition is a family-run tavern worth seeking out for its homespun take on izakaya eats and gracious hospitality. Start with single-serve sake in a jar so cute you'll want to smuggle it home, or a cocktail inspired by Japanese literature (the Norwegian Wood, a delicious interpretation of the Haruki Murakami novel ""Noruwei no Mori,"" blends whiskey, Luxurdo, sweet vermouth, and orange bitters).The array of small plates brims with creativity and flavor: tsukune are coarse-ground, delightfully chewy, and achieve a mouthwateringly charred exterior from having been grilled over bincho-tan; while tako-yaki are as delicious as any found on a Tokyo sidewalk. Korroke, a panko-crusted potato croquette, comes with tonkatsu sauce for delicious dunking.",0,0
1314,Pizzeria da Nella,Italian,2,"Though it calls itself a pizzeria, this cheerful and vast Italian hang near DePaul University is so much more. A mosaic-tiled wood-burning oven gleams from the rear of the dimly lit space, brightened by sunny yellow and Mediterranean blue walls. Craft beer nerds should take a seat at the bar for a sampling from the varied list of artisanal Italian brews. Authentic Neapolitan pizzas share menu space with modern stuffed ""bomba"" pies like the Ciotta Ciotta, which mounds a deli case's worth of salumi and cheeses between two pizza dough rounds. Pasta selections are equally sprawling, and include fresh combinations like pappardelle with plump mussels, black truffles, and pecorino. Limoncello-soaked strawberries over homemade sponge cake keep the finale light.",0,0
1315,La Plena,Latin American,1,"Owners Epi and Soraya Velez have created a warm and welcoming haven for anyone hoping to enjoy a little piece of Puerto Rico in Chicago. Their home-style cooking would make any Boricua proud, offering standards from mofongo to lechon and even the holiday favorite of coquito-with much less of the heaviness often associated with the traditional cuisine. As the story goes, the jibarito was created by Chicago's Puerto Rican community, and La Plena's rendition-featuring thin steak strips, garlicky mayonnaise, and melted cheese between fried flattened plantains-is an exceptional example. For dessert, dig into a slice of dense, eggy flan while you take in the dining room's custom murals that showcase Puerto Rico's beaches and countryside.",0,0
1316,Coast Sushi Bar,Japanese,2,"Dimly lit but lively, this high-volume sushi bar cranks out a remarkable variety of rolls to keep up with demand especially on weekends from noon till night. Two spacious dining rooms and a narrow sushi counter armed with wood-framed chairs accommodate the chatty crowds. Bring your own sake, wine, and bottle opener to make the wait more tolerable. The broad selection of Japanese dishes ranges from signature maki and nigiri to innovative appetizers like fried soft-shell crab with mango-shallot salsa. Miso soup spiked with jalapeño is served in a coffee cup for easy sipping. A deep bowl of boatman chirashi is laden with orange tobiko, pickled veggies, shiso leaves, and an array of sashimi. Dig right in or grab a sheet of toasted nori for a custom-wrapped hand roll.",0,0
1317,Juno,Japanese,3,"Raw fish with a side of creativity differentiates Juno from the rest of this city's sushi brethren. With a plain, tavern-like bar up front as well as a bright, inviting dining room and counter (the best seat in the house) in back, this low-key spot is popular for a casual meal. The menu offers cool bites like the Juno queen, a special nigiri of salmon topped with spicy scallop and potato crunch; and hot treats like honey-glazed quail. Chef B.K. Park's omakase must be ordered 48-hours in advance, but with cleverly spun morsels like briefly torched prawn with pineapple salsa, pickled garlic oil-drizzled New Zealand King salmon, soy-marinated sea eel dabbed with ground sesame seeds, and spicy octopus temaki, it's a feast well worth the extra effort.",0,0
1318,Nana,American,2,"While Nana Solis is the matriarch of this family-run Bridgeport favorite, her children (who were raised just upstairs) keep the kitchen and dining room humming. A devoted breakfast crowd takes up residence at the coffee bar and butcher block tables each day, often perusing the colorful modern artwork for sale on the walls. Locally sourced and organic are the guiding principles behind every ingredient here; many dishes also get a little Latin flavor. Soft avocado wedges are tossed in panko, then flash-fried for a crispy exterior and creamy center. ""Nanadicts"" give a Southwestern accent to eggs Benedict by adding chorizo, corn pupusas, and poblano cream. Sunday nights feature family-style fried chicken dinners fit for large groups with larger appetites.",0,0
1319,mfk.,Spanish,2,"""First we eat, then we do everything else,"" said M.F.K. Fisher, the food writer who serves as both the inspiration and namesake for this young neighborhood darling. Thanks to large windows, whitewashed brick walls, and gleaming silver-and-white tilework, the subterranean space manages to evoke a breezy seaside oasis. And with a seafood-centric menu featuring modern interpretations of Iberian-inspired plates, the food follows suit. The ocean's bounty is showcased in simple but flavorful dishes, like crispy fried prawn heads served with a nutty salbitxada sauce for dipping; and bowls of cataplana stew with fresh clams, crunchy shrimp, and grilled cobia collar. A crumbly slice of Basque cake and an expertly pulled cortado ends the meal on a high note.",0,0
1320,Red Door,International,2,"Even with no sign, it's easy to find this funky Bucktown bar: that red door is impossible to miss. Grab a metal barstool or a raised wooden banquette for an evening of seasonal cocktails, craft beers, and internationally inspired pub fare. On warm evenings, the backyard patio becomes romantic with candlelit communal tables and a canopy of twinkling lights overhead. Gastropub classics take a spin around the globe, while often featuring local ingredients (sometimes right from the patio). Bulgogi-style hanger steak and eggs is a weekend brunch favorite, layering tender chunks of meat over scrambled eggs with a pile of spicy, hangover-busting kimchi on the side. Poutine boasts Wisconsin's Brunkow cheese curds and spicy curry gravy.",0,0
1321,The Bristol,American,2,"Get to know your neighbors a little better at this dim, bustling haunt boasting a lineup of seasonal American treats with a Mediterranean twist. Regulars sit shoulder-to-shoulder at thick butcher block communal tables or at the concrete bar, squinting under filament bulbs to see the constantly changing menu's latest additions on chalkboards throughout the room. After sharing a Moscow Mule in a frosty copper mug, duck fat fries, or monkey bread with dill butter, it might be time for messy elotes tossed with sweet chili jam to be licked off each finger; or an heirloom tomato tart with a SarVecchio cheese crust and shaved onions. Do the right thing and save room for homemade Nutter Butter cookies with dark chocolate sabayon for dipping.",0,0
1322,Belly Shack,Fusion,1,"Belly Shack's concise menu is an eclectic Asian-Latin mash-up that reflects the Korean and Puerto Rican backgrounds of Chef Bill Kim and his wife, Yvonne Cadiz-Kim. Place your order and take a number-a metal stand that looks like it was made by a high school shop class-then wait for your dishes to arrive. Korean barbecued beef is a favorite, but regulars enjoy new tastes from the roster of daily specials that can include the lechon tostada. This treat is comprised of thinly sliced, slow-roasted pork loin piled high onto a fried corn tortilla with grated sharp cheddar, mashed smoky black beans, and pineapple-cilantro salsa. For dessert, lick up peaks of creamy vanilla soft-serve with topping combos such as caramel and freshly grated Vietnamese cinnamon.",0,0
1323,Bar Pastoral,International,2,"When Wrigleyville denizens want to say cheese, they head to Bar Pastoral, the rustic bistro companion to an artisan cheese and wine shop. Subtly styled like a cave for aging, the restaurant's barrel-vaulted ceilings and exposed brick walls evoke intimacy. A glossy half-moon bar, marble-topped cheese counter, and rustic wood tables inlaid with wooden wine box details let guests gather and sample. As expected, many dishes feature cheese, though shareable plates run from house-made charcuterie to bone-in pork chops. Thick slices of bacon-wrapped country pâté are generously studded with pistachios. A succinct wine list offers a number of by-the-glass selections for pairing with cheese-such as the raw cow's milk Kentucky Rose served with caramelized onion chutney.",0,0
1324,Chilam Balam,Mexican,2,"Chilam Balam's cozy subterranean space feels like an undiscovered hideaway, but the secret of this lively Mexican hot spot is out. Though waits can be long, the accommodating staff goes the extra mile to mix up margaritas with BYO tequila or walk guests through the rotating roster of shared plates. Familiar favorites and seasonal specials make for a festive mix of adventurous, yet universally pleasing dishes. Flat corn tortillas form a sandwich-style enchilada, stuffed with fork-tender beef brisket and topped with crunchy strands of sweet potato slaw. Salty chorizo and green papaya tlacoyos show that opposites attract, and peanut butter empanadas-primed for dipping in Oaxacan chocolate sauce and dulce de leche-take a childhood favorite to new heights.",0,0
1325,DMK Burger Bar,American,1,"Outside, towering neon ""DMK"" letters shine like a beacon for burger fanatics; inside, craft beers gush from taps and attentive, accommodating servers sling mile-high piles of fries. With blaring music and church pew-lined banquettes, it's a cool and modern hang for families and friends of all ages. Sate salt cravings with a batch of batter-fried okra pods and tangy pickle spears dipped in creamy herbed ranch; then order by number to get the creative grass-fed burger of your choice. The #3 takes on a Reuben with pastrami, sauerkraut, and Gruyère; while #9 is the platonic ideal of a patty melt, with smoked Swiss, caramelized onions, and chewy bacon between caraway-studded slices of rye bread. Save room for #15-the always-interesting daily special.",0,0
1326,Fish Bar,Seafood,2,"Chicago may not be known for local seafood, but Fish Bar makes sure to handpick the best from both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to fill its chilled coffers. A blackboard above the semi-open kitchen lists the fresh daily fish and oyster offerings, ready to be shucked, steamed, fried, and grilled for guests lining up at the wood bar that snakes around the room. The casual menu pays homage to classic coastal fish shacks, yet throws in a few gussied-up items like tartare and octopus à la plancha. Bowls of gumbo stick to the classic recipe with zippy andouille sausage, okra, and chunks of blue crab. The Satchmo po'boy is a mouthful, combining fried rock shrimp and crawfish tails along with slaw and sweet pickles in a traditional, buttery split-top roll.",0,0
1327,ATK,Thai,2,"Chef Andy Aroonrasameruang's Thai kitchen has earned numerous accolades and a devout following in its brief existence. Bring friends and settle in to the slender, spotless room arranged with ebony-finished tables and accent walls painted with hues evocative of turmeric and purple onion. Cooked-to-order creations are spicy, sour, crunchy, and aromatic-as in the snappy Isaan-style sausage sided by a mouthwatering dipping sauce. The kao soy features thin egg noodles in a rich golden-yellow curry stocked with pounded chicken, bean sprouts, raw cabbage, and pickled mustard greens-all topped by a nest of crunchy fried noodles. The duck in red curry is chili-revved, redolent of five-spice, and balanced by the sweetness of diced pineapple, grapes, and tomato.",0,0
1328,La Casa De Samuel,Mexican,1,"Though the sign over the awning reads ""Cocina Internacional,"" make no mistake: this Mexican restaurant has been bringing tacos and queso fundido to Pilsen since 1989. Exposed wood beams, brick walls, and bright oil paintings add a true-blue vibe; while a tortilla station where an abuelita works masa into thin discs gets the appetite going. Multi-generational families return time and again to share spicy molcajete-crushed salsa. Along with the freshly made tortillas that arrive swaddled and warm from the grill, the bustling kitchen turns out solid standards like fajitas as well as unusual wild game options like grilled wild boar, rabbit, or alligator. Wash down baby eels sizzling with garlic and chile with an icy lime-infused margarita.",0,0
1329,"Table, Donkey and Stick",Austrian,2,"When American comfort food just won't suffice, look to Table, Donkey and Stick for a helping of cozy Alpine fare. The rustic inn-inspired setting reflects its reputation as a gathering place where friends meet at the inviting bar or settle in at communal tables for whimsical, creative compositions. Though the food is European-influenced, ingredients from local farms make their way into many dishes. Caraway seeds spice up duck meatballs nestled among springy egg noodles with dehydrated sauerkraut and shaved salted egg yolk, and honeycomb tripe wins new fans when fried to a crisp and topped with house-made giardiniera. For a sweet take on the traditional baked good, try the pretzel-shaped puff pastry sprinkled with candied mustard seeds.",0,0
1330,Kanela,American,1,"A comfortable, lived-in setting makes this breakfast club more like a home away from home for many Lakeview residents. The cozy chocolate-brown dining room packs in hungry brunchers on weekends, but the flung-open front windows, efficient kitchen (and a Bloody Mary or two) keep everyone happy. Since Kanela is Greek for ""cinnamon,"" the signature pastry is appropriately loaded with spiced sugar, vanilla frosting, and blueberries. A flight of four kinds of French toast sweetens the deal for indecisive types. But savory brunchers have a host of options too, including the Lorraine scramble with Gruyère, peppered bacon, and sprightly scallions. Brunch cocktails, fresh-squeezed juices and smoothies, as well as Julius Meinl coffee cover all the beverage bases.",0,0
1331,Osteria Langhe,Italian,2,"A tapestry-length photograph of the Piemontese countryside is the only nod to tradition in Osteria Langhe's buzzy contemporary space. Lines of glowing bulbs hanging from a sculptural grid bring warmth to bare wood tables and metal chairs. A communal table at the restaurant's entrance, visible through the garage-like glass façade, shines like a beacon of conviviality. Don't spoil your appetite by eating too many of the complimentary house-made black olive grissini before the entrées arrive. Regional specialties abound on the menu: rich, eggy strands of tajarin swirl around braised beef ragù or simple butter and sage. Use delicate crêpe-like crespella, filled with a variety of seasonal vegetables, to sop up spicy leek fonduta.",0,0
1332,Wood,Contemporary,2,"The décor at this Boystown spot might be all grown-up with rich wood tones set against pale tufted booths and a glossy cream bar, but witty winks to the gay community pop up throughout the menu. Cocktails like a ""manhandled sour"" are as suggestively named as they are superbly prepared. Heck, even Sunday brunch is titled ""Morning Wood."" That said, the menu is incredibly refined. Choose from seasonal American food like roasted venison with creamed spinach as well as homemade sausage and spaetzle. Or opt for the country ham flatbread topped with creamy raclette and charred black kale, presented in squares for easy sharing. The bar continues to pour long after the kitchen closes, so night owls sample from the ""Backwoods"" menu of Belgian frites and sauces.",0,0
1333,Bakin' & Eggs,American,1,"A pastry case chockablock with cupcakes, cookies, and brownies entices passersby into this relaxed Lincoln Avenue breakfast and lunch hangout. Inside, whitewashed repurposed church pews provide ample seating for both big families as well as solo hipsters who can be seeen sipping on Intelligentsia coffee, which is on hand for a pick-me-up. As the sibling of Wicker Park's Lovely Bake Shop, it's no wonder the moist, generously frosted cupcakes take the cake. Flavors like pumpkin spice, peanut butter and jelly, and red velvet make it hard to pick a favorite. Latin influences on the savory menu mean carb-loaded and dense chilaquiles with avocado and tomatillos. A kids' menu offers mini breakfast burritos or buttermilk pancakes with whipped cream smiles.",0,0
1334,Milt's Barbecue for the Perplexed,Barbecue,1,"The full name of this kosher spot is Milt's Barbecue for the Perplexed, but even without pork (or dairy) on the menu, there's no sign of ""confusion"" among patrons, as the catalog of smoky barbecue and Jewish deli delights are bound to appease one and all. Additionally, 100% of their profits go to charity, so get in here and get your craving on. The room is simple, with dark wood furnishings and floors, but the kitchen is all sparkle. Tender chopped brisket on a toasted hamburger bun arrives with a trio of barbecue sauces-mustardy Carolina, smoky Memphis, and sweet Kansas City-and fries in a wire fryer basket; while pulled smoked chicken makes its way into the homemade soup. Don't expect to take your Friday night date here as Milt closes at sundown out of respect for the Sabbath.",0,0
1335,P.S. Bangkok,Thai,1,"Even first-timers are part of the family at P.S. Bangkok, a charming Lakeview retreat run by a trio of sisters. Wind chimes ring softly as Sue (who runs the front of the house) graciously welcomes each guest. Linen-draped tables, wooden arches, and bamboo accents lend subtle elegance to the space. Diners do double takes at intriguingly titled dishes that depart from the usual Thai menu. ""Love me tender"" duck is a sweetheart of a meal, featuring fanned duck breast slices with crackling, sugary skin in a citrus-tinged sauce. ""Beef paradise"" is marinated in garlic and spices, and served with Thai barbecue dipping sauce. Stir-fried entrées named for flavor profiles like pungent, tangy, or peppery let guests cater to their own taste buds.",0,0
1336,Parson's Chicken & Fish,American,2,"For the young professionals and new families of gentrifying Logan Square, Parson's Chicken & Fish is a lively but low-key hangout that hits all the bases. It's equally appropriate for a midday snack with the kids or late-night munchies run, and the stay-and-play vibe extends to on-site activities like a winter ice skating rink or summer ping pong tables. As per the name, poultry and piscine offerings are house specialties, with signature golden-fried chicken (and equally popular Negroni slushies) on many tables. An aïoli-smeared brioche bun holds a piping-hot fillet of beer-battered fish topped with crisp slaw and house hot sauce. Dessert isn't made in house, but no matter; neighboring Bang Bang Pie Shop provides daily slices of sweetness.",0,0
1337,Home Bistro,American,2,"Home dishes up loads of charm with a healthy dash of humor in the heart of Boystown. Flickering tea lights on the closely packed bistro-style tables faintly illuminate cozy orange walls painted with food-related quotes. Chef Victor Morenz's eclectic menu picks up influences from around the globe, but each dish is consistently gratifying. Southern meets south of the border in crisp fried oyster tacos with pickled pepper remoulade. Candied kumquats and olive tapenade contrast pleasantly with buttery seared duck breast, and a dense cube of warm, fudgy chocolate cake placed over a swipe of coconut peanut butter is a decadent finale. Plan for an early evening if you're looking forward to a quiet meal; at peak hours, those orange walls really reverberate.",0,0
1338,Chicago Diner,Vegetarian,1,"""Meat free since '83"" is the slogan at Chicago Diner, where servers have been slinging creative, healthy fare to grateful vegetarians and vegans for decades. The ambience evokes a neighborhood diner with fire engine-red tables trimmed in chrome, shiny black vinyl chairs, and raised booths. And the food? It looks and tastes the part. Convincingly crispy seitan buffalo wings cool down the spice factor with vegan ranch dressing; while flautas filled with mashed potato, faux cheese, and jalapeños are served with tons of flavorful fixings so that the meat is not missed at all. With a popular brunch menu, numerous gluten-free choices, and a stronghold on the local vegan scene, you can expect a line. So, get there early or hope for good Karma-and a seat.",0,0
1339,Masada,Middle Eastern,1,"Masada Ramli, the mother of owner Shadi Ramli, is the inspiration of this richly adorned spot bedecked with metal lanterns and colorful glazed tiles. A collection of hamsas at the entrance wards off evil, and the lower level lounge pours a bevy of sprits including cocktails, crafts beers, and arak. Although kebabs and wraps can be ordered, there's nothing commonplace about Masada's home-style cooking. Instead, imagine the likes of lamb's kidney and heart sautéed with onions and oyster mushrooms; or fetit betinjan, crunchy pita cubes and roasted eggplant dressed with tahini, pomegranate molasses, and lemon. A number of vegan options abound and attract, including koshari, a hearty mélange of rice, lentils, and gluten-free pasta, accompanied by spicy tomato sauce and tart pickles.",0,0
1340,Owen & Engine,Gastropub,2,"Owen & Engine's charm extends from its glossy black façade into its warm polished wood interior and all the way to the second-floor dining room that sees action into the wee hours. Brocade wallpaper, gas lights, and studded leather club chairs lend a Victorian feel. A frequently changing draft list always features a few selections pulled from a beer cask (or ""engine""). British-inspired gastropub grub matches the impressive roster of brews and Pimm's cups. Bar nibbles like mustard-glazed soft pretzels with Welsh rarebit for dipping; or peanuts tossed in sriracha, Worcestershire, and brown sugar cater to the snacking sort. Hearty entrées like bangers and mash feature house-made Slagel Family Farm's pork sausage and potatoes smothered in onion gravy.",0,0
1341,Fat Willy's,Barbecue,2,"With piles of hickory and applewood stacked at the entrance and the sweet-spicy aroma of smoke filling the air, Fat Willy's telegraphs an authentic barbecue experience from the outset. Vintage hand mixers decorate one wall, but this isn't a precious farmhouse bakery-the meat is front and center, as indicated by the rolls of paper towels and sheets of Kraft paper laid out over gingham tablecloths. Signature baby back ribs are pink and glistening with fat after a slow smoke, and a duo of house-made barbecue sauces lets diners kick things up as desired. Minced fresh garlic adorns the pulled pork sandwich, with a few shakes of seasoned vinegar for extra oomph. After those savory indulgences, a slice of cool, creamy peanut butter mousse cake is just the ticket.",0,0
1342,The Radler,German,2,"With around 20 suds on tap and more than 95 bottles to sample, The Radler is everything you want a beer hall to be. Though the space is new, it has an old soul: communal benches hearken back to the days of classic Bavarian biergartens, and the enormous Bohemian Export beer mural that commands guests' attention is indigenous to the building-a happy discovery during demolition. A stack of small plates on each table sends the message that everything on the menu is meant for sharing. A German onion pie arrives straight from the oven, topped with shaved asparagus and made-to-order Pilsner soubise. Four types of wurst are available by the link, like Thüringer-served over a bed of spring green peas with authentic marinated cucumber salad and traditional mustard.",0,0
1343,La Encantada,Mexican,1,"Encantada is Spanish for enchanting, and this family-run spot more than lives up to its name. Royal-blue, golden-yellow, and exposed brick walls are hung with gallery-style artwork (most of which is for sale), and contemporary Latin tunes waft through the air. Culinary inspiration begins in the family's hometown, Zacatecas, but pulls from around Mexico with delectable results. Enchiladas rojas, a Zacatecan specialty, are as authentic as one could wish. Two small, salted beef-filled tortillas are draped with earthy salsa rojas for muted chili heat, while avocado and crema fresca bring depth to a rustic chicken tortilla soup. The chewy, caramelized crust on pan-fried plantains is textbook perfect, served with a dollop of cinnamon-laced cream.",0,0
1344,Frasca,Italian,2,"The warmth of the wood-burning brick oven and the list of generously priced wines is enough to entice Lakeview's young professionals into the friendly confines of Frasca. Amidst décor inspired by the restaurant's name (""branch"" in Italian), lively groups and intimate dates sample wine flights and split appetizers like charred Brussels sprouts and cauliflower florets tossed with bacon and briny capers. Chewy pizza crusts blistered from the heat of the oven are laden with market-fresh toppings.

Local products and in-house goodies are stocked in the front of the narrow space, while the rear offers comfortable banquettes for a casual sit-down meal. Breakfast is served as long as the sun shines, with options like a freshly baked and buttered English muffin stuffed with ginger-sage sausage, a vibrant orange sunny side-up egg, and sweet pepper jelly. A side of red bliss potatoes sweetens the deal, but if you're really looking for something sugary, the grilled coffee cake is a double-layered cinnamon and cream cheese delight. Craving more of your meal? You're in luck: certain menu items, denoted with an asterisk, are available for purchase up front.",0,0
1346,L' Patron,Mexican,1,"Don't worry-the long line stretching past L'Patron's neon-bright façade isn't cause for concern. Counter service moves quickly at this affordable and popular Diversey Avenue taqueria, as staffers smoothly satiate customers with a concise but tasty array of tortas, tacos, and burritos wrapped in handmade tortillas. The interior décor is just as colorful as the outside, with pulsing Latin music to keep you moving as you munch. Ultra-fresh dishes are cooked to order, like a grilled burrito stuffed with charred poblanos, caramelized onion, and tomatillo-jalapeño salsa. Carne asada tacos arrive packed with grilled, well-seasoned beef; while crisp tortilla chips, still warm from the fryer, are addictive companions for scooping chunky, garlicky guacamole.",0,0
1347,Jam,American,1,"Hiding in plain sight on a residential Logan Square block, Jam remains the sweetheart of brunch-o-philes who won't settle for some greasy spoon. Clean white walls and gray stone tables punctuated by lime green placemats give a gallery-like feel to the space; a friendly welcome and wide-open kitchen keep it homey. Their brunch standards like French toast are nothing short of luxurious: think brioche soaked in vanilla- and malt-spiked custard cooked sous vide to absorb every drop, then caramelized in a sizzling pan and garnished with lime leaf-whipped cream and pineapple compote. Braised beef, tangy tomato crema, and smoked Gouda are rolled into lacy buckwheat crêpes and topped with a sunnyside egg for an elegant take on the breakfast burrito.",0,0
1348,Lula Cafe,American,2,"Despite a gleamingly renovated kitchen, neighborhood darling Lula Cafe remains the same beloved hangout it's always been. No matter what's on the constantly evolving menu, the fresh, seasonal, and always original fare keeps the casual spot slammed with the creative denizens of Logan Square from morning to night. The mouthwatering fixings in Lula's Royale breakfast sandwich change with the seasons and might include thin slices of meaty, tender short rib, a sunny-side up farm egg, smoky cumin aïoli and bitter orange jam served alongside a salad of vinegary carrot, daikon, and cilantro. Sweet teeth are satisfied by a tall wedge of double-layered carrot cake complete with crème anglaise and a luxurious spoonful of strawberry preserves on the side.",0,0
1349,Fat Rice,Asian,2,"Not familiar with the food of Macau? Not to worry-Fat Rice turns the uninitiated into believers nightly. A wooden pergola shelters hardy souls braving the infamous wait for a table. Bar seating around the open kitchen gives a bird's-eye view of the mélange of ingredients used in each dish, though servers are happy to walk any guest through the intoxicating mashup of Portuguese and Asian cuisine. Sharing is recommended for platters like the namesake arroz gordo, a paella-esque blend of meat, shellfish, and pickles. Pillowy bread sops up chunky olive-and-bacalhau spread in a pool of verdant olive oil. Shredded dried pork and fried shallots are intriguing but successful dessert components, when paired with salted caramel, sesame and crispy rice.",0,0
1350,TAC Quick,Thai,1,"The focus at this Wrigleyville institution is on speedy, authentic Thai food-and that's exactly what you'll get. Colorful orchids brighten up the minimal space, where solo diners sit at the narrow center bar and people-watchers keep an eye on the hustle and bustle outside from high tables near the windows. Two laminated menus-one with standard fare, and another ""secret"" listing with more traditional dishes-ensure there's something for everyone. It's hard to resist double-dipping a stack of glistening, charred moo ping pork skewers in sour, spicy, and sweet sauce, or finishing every flaky morsel of pad ped pla duk (fried catfish with creamy green curry). Spice crazed? You're in luck; TAC Quick's heat level is perhaps the most authentic around.",0,0
1351,Longman & Eagle,Gastropub,2,"Poised along a trendy corner and marked by a single ampersand over the door, this is the ultimate merger of the Old World and New Order. It's the kind of place where remnants of a glorious past live in harmony with more current elements, and where chefs prefer bandanas and beards to toques. Yet, the cuisine is as haute as ever. Millennials never tire of this local hangout and its numerous dining nooks, including the hip and happening bar that pours an exceptional carte of cocktails; a boisterous front dining room; as well as an exposed brick alcove that flaunts both space and privacy. Open from early to late, the jumping tavern cooks up an exciting lineup of truly extraordinary fare. Make a decadent start with duck (pastrami, confit, and heart) in a jar neatly coupled with rice, beans, and potatoes. Black bass, fried oysters, and green tomato chow chow in a Southern pork broth is another rich dish; while buckwheat cannelloni with chickpeas, French feta, and fennel barigoule in soubise is as wholesome as it is heavenly. At the end, black sesame doughnuts with tapioca and coconut are creamy, crunchy, and certify nothing short of sweet dreams-perhaps in one of the hotel rooms above the bar?",1,1
1352,Yusho,Japanese,2,"Just off the beaten (and quickly gentrifying) path from its Logan Square brethren, Yusho quietly draws a crowd. A narrow façade hides a deceptively expansive room done up in a rustic-chic mix of weathered wood planks, cement floors, plaid-upholstered booths, and Danish midcentury chairs. Diners show up in droves for a rotating selection of steamed buns, crispy chicken bits, and slurpable noodle bowls. ""Logan Poser Ramen"" showcases Chef/owner Matthias Merges' house-made noodles, a swirl of thick, al dente strands in spicy tonkatsu broth. A poached hen egg and crispy pig's tail croquette take it over the top. Vegetarians delight in an elegant pickled gobo root salad with translucent Asian pear and black plum slices and silky tofu-tobanjan dressing.",0,0
1353,Kuma's Corner,American,1,"Even vegans know the cult following of Kuma's Corner, though there's absolutely nothing for them on the menu at this heavy metal burger joint on an unassuming Avondale corner. It's not for the faint of heart: between the crowds, the crunching blasts of sound, and the NC-17 artwork. Steady yourself with a beer or Bourbon while waiting for a table and a juicy patty. The lines wouldn't be stretching out the door if the kitchen weren't cranking out kick-ass burgers. The menu features more than a dozen options of 10-oz. monsters served on pretzel rolls with myriad toppings like roasted garlic mayonnaise, house-made hot sauce, and pepper jack cheese. Almost as famous, mac and cheese with add-ins offers a comparably artery-clogging change of pace.",0,0
1354,The Piggery,American,2,"The bacon is back-as well as the ham, the shoulder, and the rest of the pig too. This Lakeview sports bar and shrine to all things porcine pays homage to its whimsical ways by way of kitschy pig paraphernalia that shares shelf and wall space with flat-screens tuned to Cubs and Sox games, naturally. The menu may be hell for vegans, but it's a pork lover's paradise: cuts from every part of the animal find their way into nearly each dish, from hearty ham-stuffed burgers to the signature bacon-wrapped jalapeño poppers. Gently charred slabs of ribs basted with the Piggery's own heady barbecue sauce are teeth-sinkingly tender. Even salads may give you the meat sweats, with pulled pork or buffalo chicken-and bacon, of course-offered as toppings.",0,0
1355,Friendship,Chinese,2,"Innovative Chinese cuisine and sophisticated cocktails make this hip Logan Square venue worth seeking out. Inside the dimly-lit space, wood-lined walls, sleek banquettes, linen-draped tables, and polished cooper accents play off a palette of rich neutrals to lend a modern, upscale vibe. Friendship's spirited menu offers both traditional cuisine and enticing departures. Fruit juices and liquors enhance items like Barbarian beef with a chili-cabernet sauce. Then, Champagne lemon chicken, XO brandy beef chow fun, and sizzling Xi'an pork with a red chilli-and-black bean sauce all boast salty, sweet, and spicy notes. Chocolate fortune cookies are a sweet finish, but if in need of more, you're in luck: there's a second outpost downtown on the lakefront.",0,0
1356,Via Lima,Peruvian,2,"Via Lima infuses a chic, contemporary personality into the typical rustic atmosphere of a Peruvian restaurant. Here, Lakeview residents pack themselves into comfortable booths upholstered in colorful fabrics, sharing dishes from a refined menu of familiar classics or tucking into larger entrées at bare wood tables. A bracingly sour leche de tigre broth infused with fiery South American rocoto chile adds zing to market-fresh fish ceviche, while starchy corn kernels and a scoop of creamy sweet potatoes tame the heat. Choclo soufflé blends a fluffy, mildly sweet corn cake with meltingly tender duck confit to balance sweet and savory; while Lucuma mousse subtly showcases the vibrant marigold-hued Peruvian fruit, topped with a spoonful of fresh vanilla whipped cream.",0,0
1357,Parachute,Fusion,2,"Husband-and-wife chef team Johnny Clark and Beverly Kim have put their little corner of Avondale on Chicago's culinary map with this hip and homey bistro. Young foodies fill the space every night, whether seated at tables lining the wooden banquette or perched on colorful stools dotting a double-sided slab of counter, half of which faces the open kitchen. Clark and Kim's exemplary cuisine results from a deep understanding of the Korean pantry as well as a brilliant application of au courant technique to seasonal product. Baked potato bing bread, the restaurant's signature flaky flatbread carb-bomb, is stuffed with melted scallions and bacon bits, topped with nutty sesame, and served with sour cream butter. Then, cauliflower is deep-fried, set over cool, herbaceous raita, and studded with shards of spicy tandoori chicken skin; while dukbokki, or Korean rice cakes, are pan-crisped and combined with bits of succulent goat meat sausage and refreshingly bitter wilted rapini. Desserts are a stellar finish-think silky panna cotta served with a soy sauce-caramel drizzle and topped with popped corn, or a novel take on fruit crisp with buckwheat, Bing cherries, ginger-spiced broth, and scoop of sakura ice cream.",1,1
1358,Sticky Rice,Thai,1,"There's no dearth of Thai joints in this neighborhood, but Sticky Rice stands out-not only for its focus on Northern Thai specialties, but also for the quality and abundance of dishes made to order. Sunny and citrus-hued, it's the kind of place where those who dare to step outside their satay-and-pad Thai comfort zone will be greatly rewarded. Luckily, the extensive menu makes it easy to do just that. Tender egg noodles absorb the fragrant coconut curry in a bowl of kow soy that's redolent of citrusy coriander and served with pickled greens and cilantro. Larb duck is zippy and full of spice, with an unforgettable tart-and-sweet dressing. Hint: use the spot's namesake sticky rice to temper the heat while soaking up every last drop.",0,0
1359,Mixteco Grill,Mexican,2,"Floor-to-ceiling windows that wrap around the corner of Montrose and Ashland are flanked by cheerful orange curtains that imitate Mixteco's fiery and flavorful Mexican fare. A large open kitchen splits the casual dining space, giving the front room's patrons a firsthand look at the mesquite-fired grill and from-scratch preparations. Non-traditional menu items might miss the mark here and there, but familiar dishes don't disappoint-and neither do the reasonable prices that pull in crowds of regulars. Shredded chicken enchiladas (wrapped with house-made tortillas) balance earthy, complex mole negro with a burst of brightness from radish matchsticks, cilantro, and raw onion; and thick and creamy refried black beans ensure that no one leaves hungry.",0,0
1360,Cho Sun Ok,Korean,1,"As tempted as you might be to judge this book by its brisk, unsmiling cover, don't. Instead, enter the cozy, wood-paneled den and raise that first delicious forkful to your mouth. Take a cue from the regulars and start with galbi, a crave-worthy signature that glistens from a soy- sugar- and garlic-marinade and warrants good old-fashioned finger-licking. Haemul pajeon stuffed with squid and scallions is a crisp, golden-fried delight; and kimchi jjigae is a rich, bubbling, and nourishing broth packed with soft tofu and tender pork. Summer calls for a taste of the bibim naengmyeon-a chilled broth floating with buckwheat noodles, fresh veggies, Asian pear, and crimson-red gochujang all tossed together for a delicious reprieve from the city's sweltering heat.",0,0
1361,Staropolska,Polish,1,"Fans of traditional Polish cooking know to proceed to this Logan Square mainstay. If a stroll past nearby Kurowski's Sausage Shop doesn't put you in the mood for some meaty, belly-busting cuisine, then one step inside this Old World-style sanctum certainly will. Polish pilsners and lagers are poured at the bar and pair perfectly with the stuffed and slow-cooked plates sent out by the kitchen. Pierogies are a staple, and are offered here with a variety of sweet and savory embellishments. Stuffed cabbage is available with a meatless mushroom filling, and house specialties include the placek po wegiersku: a light and tender griddled potato pancake folded over chunks of pork and bell pepper slices, braised in a tomato and sweet paprika sauce.",0,0
1362,Magnolia Cafe,American,2,"Uptown residents turn to Magnolia Cafe for chic comfort in a homey neighborhood standby. Close-knit tables covered in kraft paper and tasseled lampshades hanging from exposed wood beams create a warm atmosphere for dining, while a small bar near the entry stands at the ready for creative pre-dinner cocktails and brunch mimosas. Chef/owner Kasra Medhat's menu incorporates a melting pot's worth of ingredients into American bistro standards. Huevos rancheros are filling enough to soak up the excesses of Saturday night, with two sunny side-up eggs layered with homemade salsa and guacamole over a mix of black beans, sweet corn kernels, and crumbled chorizo. Composed salads and dishes like applewood-smoked chicken pappardelle round out a roster of dinner options.",0,0
1363,Spacca Napoli,Pizza,1,"Long before Chicago deep-dish, Italy was famous for its Neapolitan pies. The ""Vera Pizza Napoletana"" sign at Spacca Napoli's door proclaims that this is the real deal, Naples-certified pizza, thanks to its authentic pizzaiolo, Jonathan Goldsmith. That glass-tiled custom Bisazza wood-burning oven in the center of the open kitchen is a tip-off, too. The casual menu features a dozen varieties of red or white pizzas, along with antipasti and desserts for those who need more than a pie. Juice glasses filled with wine and served alongside crispy squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and sweet peppers whet appetites. Pizzas arrive uncut, blistered, and charred, with just enough chewy bite to let the fresh mozzarella-cow's milk or bufala-and toppings shine.",0,0
1364,42 Grams,Contemporary,4,"To know the name refers to the supposed weight of two souls is to also know that this is not your usual restaurant. In fact, it's hardly a restaurant at all and more like a dinner party with strangers-you even need to arrive with a bottle or two of wine under your arms. There are two sittings: the first is at the counter where you watch Chef/owner Jake Bickelhaupt and his two colleagues in action; for 8.30 P.M. arrivals, it's the large communal table. For both, you'll be sharing your dinner with people you don't know, but the ice is usually broken by someone asking where their fellow diners have eaten recently. The set menu offers no choice but any allergies are discussed during the bothersome flurry of e-mails that follow the initial impersonal booking process. Then it's over to Jake's smiling wife, Alexa, to guide diners through the parade of dishes. The cooking is clever and contemporary and the ingredients superlative, whether that's the peekytoe crab ""dumpling"" or mojama de atún (air-dried, salt-cured tuna) plated on black slate and perched above a light green pea gelato. Dishes are wonderfully well-balanced and modern techniques are used to great effect to deliver superb flavors. A coffee ""spuma"" flavored with cardamom and whipped cream is an ideal way to cap off this exceptional meal.",2,1
1365,Royal Thai,Thai,1,"Stately elephants march down the silk runners on each linen-draped table at this age-old Lakeview Thai spot, adding a regal air to the already-polished dining room. Glossy bamboo floors, dark wood high-backed chairs, and ceiling fans atop light walls hung with mirrors make the space look larger than it is. What this minuscule spot lacks in size, it makes up for in big and bold flavors. Be mindful of your spice tolerance, as the kitchen is known to turn up the heat. They're not fooling around so don't plan on kissing anyone after sucking on plump Royal Thai prawns topped with a potent mix of minced, fresh garlic, dried red chillies, and fragrant cilantro. Ask for a second bowl of rice to sop up the homemade peanut curry in spicy rama chicken.",0,0
1366,Demera,Ethiopian,2,"Demera's well-lit corner location welcomes hungry Uptown residents looking to immerse themselves in Ethiopian cuisine. Colorful wicker seating at the dining room's communal table gives groups an authentic dining experience, while picture windows offer plenty of people-watching for everyone. Vegetarian and omnivorous offerings abound on the menu, which features a small glossary of terms to help newcomers. Pleasantly spicy ye-siga wot combines tender chunks of beef with onions and ginger in a rich berbere sauce. Served with turmeric-infused split peas and jalapeño-laced collard greens, this stew is a hearty pleasure. Sop up extra sauce with piles of tangy and soft injera, presented in the traditional Ethiopian manner in lieu of silverware.",0,0
1367,Miku Sushi,Japanese,2,"Miku Sushi piles on the style in a spacious location with a polished, airy room featuring a 12-seat counter plus a full bar for cocktail hounds. More than a simple sushi spot, the menu boasts artfully presented and inventive maki, ramen, yakitori, and small plates that make for a festive night of sharing with fellow food lovers. Snack on the robusuta roll, surely to become a ""Lincoln Square classic"" pairing lobster and fried banana; or for a more traditionally savory but still modern option, the Miya maki combines white tuna, snow crab, and avocado with grilled asparagus. Warm up with a bowl of springy, correctly spicy ramen teeming with fresh mushrooms, soft-boiled egg, and tender pork belly in a cloudy, miso-rich broth spiked with garlic and sesame oil.",0,0
1368,A10,Italian,2,"A10 is a highway that winds through the Italian Riviera, but its detour through Hyde Park comes courtesy of prolific restaurateur, Matthias Merges. University of Chicago students and staff populate this split space, building a buzz over marble-topped rounds in the low-key bar area or dark wood tables in the convivial dining room. Like the décor, the menu deftly balances comfort and sophistication. A single fresh pasta ribbon folded back and forth becomes lasagna filled with succulent veal osso bucco, fresh baby oregano leaves, and both quark and Parmigiano cheeses tucked within each layer. Tender chunks of octopus, Niçoise olives, and saffron-tinged slaw dress a chickpea fritter; and rustic chocolate beignets with toasted meringue triangles sweeten the finish.",0,0
1369,Bistro Campagne,French,2,"The romantic ideal of a French bistro is alive and well at Bistro Campagne. Light slants gently through wooden Venetian blinds, bouncing off cream-and-brick walls in the welcoming dining room. Choose a white cloth-covered table inside, under the red-golden soffit ceiling or outside under twinkling lights and green tree branches in the garden. Inspired accompaniments make for memorable versions of rustic French standards. Meltingly tender foie de veau sparks happy sighs from calves' liver lovers, complemented by crisp bacon and Dijon mustard cream. House-made pappardelle and maitake mushrooms soak up the lavender-infused jus that finishes white wine-braised rabbit. Black figs are tucked into a moist brown butter pain perdu drizzled with caramel.",0,0
1370,Due Lire,Italian,2,"Naples native and gentleman's gentleman Massimo Di Vuolo welcomes guests from near and far to charming Due Lire. Smartly situated near the Old Town School of Folk Music, the dining room is often dotted with locals enjoying a pre-show dinner or lingering on the back patio with a glass of Falanghina. Abstract art brings bright color and energy to the otherwise understated décor. Comforting but refined modern Italian dishes offer hearty satisfaction: creamy polenta sops up the slow-simmered stew ladled over braised lamb shank and tender root vegetables, and strands of freshly made spaghetti are bathed in rich, porky amatriciana-style ragù. For a refreshing finish, bite-sized ricotta ciambelle doughnuts-topped with limoncello-orange crema-keep things light.",0,0
1371,gather,American,2,"A chic, cozy space lets guests get up close and personal at gather. Diners seeking dinner and a show take front row seats at barstools lining the open kitchen's polished granite counter, while tall communal tables fill with patrons enjoying bites from the menu's ""gather and share"" section. A rear dining room offers more solitude and romance. Family-style Sunday dinners are a local draw, but the à la carte menu showcases flavorful options nightly. Slice into a single large uovo raviolo to mingle poached egg and ricotta with white truffle butter, jalapeño slivers, and chopped chives, or share a crock of Pernod-splashed mussels. Fragrant and garlicky, they're served with sourdough toast points for soaking up every last drop of the white wine-cream sauce.",0,0
1372,The Promontory,American,2,"Equal parts restaurant, watering hole, and music venue, The Promontory brings a much-needed gathering place to the Hyde Park community. Under lofty ceilings trimmed with black iron beams and sleek wood accents, urbanites sip hand-crafted cocktails around a central bar. A white-hot fire blazes away in the open kitchen, providing the ""hearth to table"" food trumpeted on the menu. Smoky roasted feta arrives in a pool of balsamic vinegar and oil with a generous assortment of briny olives, while shatteringly crisp black trumpet mushrooms and pickled shallot add piquant crunch to Nantucket bay scallops. For dessert, sweet brûléed marshmallow and a scoop of graham cracker ice cream sit atop a moist chocolate soufflé, a reverse take on s'mores.",0,0
1373,Luella's Southern Kitchen,Southern,2,"Luella's is named for Chef Darnell Reed's Southern-born great-grandmother, and for good reason: one bite of its soul-infused fare will transport you to her hometown of Morgan City, Mississippi, a place she left behind for Chicago many years ago-and one that lives on in her grandson's cooking. The no-frills, order-at-the-counter spot is simply adorned, with genuinely welcoming service that only adds to the charm. Every spoonful of Luella's andouille and chicken gumbo is one to remember, thanks to a roux that's been cooked for five (count 'em) hours. The hot, sugary beignets are a pastry wonder, and chicken and waffles drizzled with Bourbon syrup are Southern by way of Brussels, featuring thick, eggy Liège waffles standing in for the usual rounds.",0,0
1374,Pho 777,Vietnamese,1,"A market's worth of fresh ingredients allows Pho 777 to stand out in a neighborhood where Vietnamese restaurants-and their signature soup-seem to populate every storefront. Bottles of hot sauce, jars of fiery condiments, and canisters of spoons and chopsticks clustered on each table make it easy for regulars to sit down and start slurping. Add choices like meatballs, tendon, flank steak, and even tofu to the cardamom- ginger- and clove-spiced beef broth, which fills a bowl the size of a bathroom sink. Then throw in jalapeños, Thai basil, and mint to your liking. If you're not feeling like pho this time around, snack on spring rolls with house-made roasted peanut sauce; or a plate of lacy banh xeo stuffed with shrimp, sprouts, and herbs.",0,0
1375,Ceres' Table,Mediterranean,2,"Rounding out a second year in its Lakeview home, Ceres' Table continues its reign as a stylish setting for enjoying the kitchen team's rustic Italian cooking. Whether waking up with brunch, snacking at aperitivo hour, or filling up with the $22 trio (pizza, beer, and dessert), there's an excuse to stop in for any occasion or budget. Regional Italian favorites from Tuscany to Sicily are represented throughout the menu. A wood-burning oven brings cannellini beans to creamy consistency in a broth for meaty monkfish osso buco. Then oversized orecchiette cups chunks of tender pork sugo, balanced by bitter rapini; and Tuscan torta della nonna is sweet simplicity, with buttery baby pine nuts coating a wedge of vanilla-tinged custard pie.",0,0
1376,Pho Xe Tang - Tank Noodle,Vietnamese,1,"A stone's throw from the Little Saigon EL, this simple corner spot keeps pho enthusiasts coming back for more. Communal cafeteria-style tables, crowded during prime meal times, are stocked with all the necessary funky and spicy condiments. Efficient service keeps the joint humming and lets the patrons focus on slurping. Pho is the definitive draw here, and this fragrant, five-spiced, rice noodle- and beef-filled broth is accompanied by sprouts, lime wedges, and plenty of basil. Other delights on the massive menu include shrimp- and pork-stuffed rice flour rolls with addictive sweet and sour nuoc cham; followed by spicy catfish soup simmered with an intriguing combination of okra, pineapple, and bamboo shoots drizzled with garlic oil.",0,0
1377,Arun's,Thai,4,"Dining at Arun's feels like attending a dinner party hosted by a well-traveled friend. Covered wall-to-wall in rich carpeting and filled with artwork and figurines, the dining room feels homey and intimate. Adding to the ambience, the kitchen offers a choice of seven- ten- or 12-course chef's tastings nightly in lieu of à la carte. The dishes on each tasting menu shift according to the chef's whims, and some are more successful than others. Courses range from the familiar and comforting to the innovative: crisp, shatteringly light batter coats two thin strips of pork belly; a hearty chunk of beef tenderloin melts into rich spice-infused massaman curry; and a squirt of lemon balances the fragrant coconut broth and crushed chili peppers of mee kati noodles.",0,0
1378,ampersand wine bar,American,2,"This cool wine bar cuts a stylish figure with its pale walls, gorgeous blonde wood, and sun-flooded dining room. Combine that urbane setting with polished service and a simple, but perfectly executed menu and you have one of the best new spots in town. Grab a seat at the long, L-shaped bar, the best perch in the house to ask a zillion questions-or just dig in as the small plates begin their march from behind the counter. The menu, at the moment anyway, is small but packs a big punch-what's available is seasonal, diverse, and extremely fresh. A cold and creamy gold tomato gazpacho features tart strips of roasted eggplant and cool cucumber; while a deconstructed strawberry shortcake arrives in layers of luscious basil caramel and sweet berries.",0,0
1379,La Petite Folie,French,2,"Though its tree-lined courtyard off 55th Street may not be as picturesque as the Tuileries, La Petite Folie remains a transporting Gallic hideaway in Hyde Park. The graceful lace-curtained dining room and curvaceous wood bar draws scholarly types from nearby University of Chicago, with prices that satiate student budgets. A retinue of French classics like whole trout Grenobloise are refreshed by seasonal market ingredients at the hands of Chef/co-owner Mary Mastricola. Slices of smoked duck drizzled with black currant vinaigrette get an earthy touch from apple-walnut compote in an elegant lunch salad. Even the wine list chosen by Mastricola's husband Michael is an all-French affair, with numerous by-the-glass choices from Bordeaux to Chablis.",0,0
1380,Isla,Filipino,1,"Don't let Isla's plain-Jane décor dissuade you-despite the flimsy curtains and bare-bones dining room, the space is practically bursting with Filipino pride. From the convivial owners and servers, to the bantering patrons getting their fix of Filipino cable TV as they eat, the warmth and love for this Southeast Asian country is clear here. Traditional dishes populate a menu that offers a whirlwind tour of the islands' bold flavors. Tinolang manok, a refreshing take on chicken soup, is redolent with ginger and punctuated by green papaya. Dried taro leaves in laing sa gata lend smokiness to tender, coconut milk-simmered pork and shrimp, and a side of Isla's famous adobo rice, spooned with the classic tart and garlicky pork stew, goes with everything.",0,0
1381,Elizabeth,Contemporary,4,"Find an owl, a deer, and a diamond over an unremarkable door on this rather commercial street-these are foodie hieroglyphs for homey yet conceptual Chicago dining. The diminutive interior has only a handful of tables, all surrounding the brightly lit kitchen spectacle. The whitewashed tin ceiling and shelves stocked with everything from Dutch ovens to jars of pickles make it seem like we're all dining in Chef Iliana Regan's cottage-chic underground restaurant. You might even see her refilling your water glass; this is a humble place where dedication trumps attitude. The nightly 17-course menu is a clear treatise on local, organic, and foraged cuisine. Don't be surprised to find bear jerky showcased in the deliciously inventive ""rock course"" that is literally served on a jet-black rock, along with a sticky bite of wild puffed rice mixed with mushroom marshmallow, and topped with Wisconsin cheddar as well as a vibrant pink peppercorn. When the glazed bowl containing a perfectly cooked duck egg and shaved truffles arrives at the table, expect a bit of theatrics as the server explains that the ""twigs"" decorating the table all along are actually fried breadsticks to enjoy with the dish.",1,1
1382,Hopleaf,Gastropub,2,"Perfectly ordinary from the outside, Hopleaf thrives as a labor of love for owners, Michael and Louise. Named after a pale ale brewed in Malta, this serious tavern has beer and food fans in raptures over their stirring selection of sips, snacks, and serious eats. Dine comfortably amid exposed brick walls, steelwork, and shabby-chic furnishings whether seated at the traditional front bar, in the rear, or by the glassed-in kitchen. A great collection of enamel beer signs will put you in the mood for a brew with your Belgian or Thai-style mussels, followed by hearty shavings of porcetta folded into crusty ciabatta with tangy giardinera and creamy mayo. Dinner may flaunt extra variety-but for dessert, fix upon lavender-buttermilk panna cotta crowned with blackberry compote.",0,0
1383,Paprika,Indian,2,"Chef Shah Kabir and his family know hospitality. Prepare to be swept up in their warmth and care (with maybe a splash of kitsch) the minute you enter this richly colored space, adorned with artifacts. Even the chef himself is at the door welcoming guests to sit and sip a cool, refreshing lassi. From aromatic, homemade curries to tasty twists on dahls (turka dahl ki shabzi is a revelation), everything is fresh and fragrant. Bengali fish curry is a notable attraction-its flavors mild yet lively with mustard seeds, firm and fresh green beans, and silky-sweet onions. A very nice selection of vegetarian dishes might include the veggie samosa: its soft, light shell is stuffed with spiced potatoes, peas, cauliflower, and served with a trio of tangy chutneys.",0,0
1384,Taketei,Japanese,1,"Though it's a mere sliver of a space, Taketei's Japanese temple to fresh piscine makes a bold statement in this neighborhood, noted for its Vietnamese joints. The wee room, so small there's not even a true sushi counter, remains serenely bright but minimal, filled with a handful of white tables and chairs. A limited menu makes the most of shiny pieces of fish. With the majority of nigiri available for less than $3 each, regulars know to load up or go all out with a sashimi platter featuring a wide selection of generously sliced seafood like mackerel, octopus, and maguro with a bowl of rice. Manageably sized, non-gimmicky rolls along with appetizers like pert, crunchy hiyashi wakame salad or spinach with sweet sesame sauce supplement this appealing array.",0,0
1385,Bread & Wine,International,2,"Bread & Wine's mix of American bistro fare and international flair mirrors the cultural melting pot of surrounding nabe Humboldt Park, and the former laundromat's parking lot fills quickly. Solo diners perch at the 10-seat counter to watch the chefs at work, while groups crowd around tables made from cross-sections of fallen trees, snacking on barbecue chicharrónes or house-made charcuterie. Plates like the mortadella sandwich smeared with olive pesto and stacked with tasso and pancetta further showcase the kitchen's prowess with cured meat. A substantial beet and barley salad is loaded with feta cheese and fresh arugula. Before you leave, browse the small market for bread, wine, and artisanal treats; diners receive a discount on same-day purchases.",0,0
1386,Jin Ju,Korean,2,"A sexy spot on a bustling stretch of North Clark, Jin Ju spins out luscious Korean classics with aplomb. Inside, dim lighting, dark wood furnishings, and luxuriant fuchsia-red walls create a sophisticated coziness, while servers are gracious and attentive. A simply-named house salad showcases the restaurant's modern, accessible Korean ethos, combining meaty pan-seared portobello strips atop delicately bitter green leaf lettuce, torn sesame leaves, cucumbers, and scallions in a funky garlic-soy sauce. Without tableside barbecue grills, fatty pork slabs are sautéed in the kitchen for sweetly caramelized sam gyup sal. Wrapped in sesame leaves with Brussels sprouts, beets, crispy leeks, and a smear of kicky miso paste, the package provides instant gratification.",0,0
1387,Smoque BBQ,Barbecue,1,"Smoque opens for lunch at 11:00 A.M., but a crowd of devotees can be found lining up for a barbecue fix long before then. Once inside, peruse the chalkboard menu, then order cafeteria-style before staking your claim among the communal seating while waiting (and salivating). The half-and-half sandwich, piled with pulled pork and brisket, is the best of both worlds, with chunky shreds of tender pork and spice-rubbed slices of pink-rimmed beef spooned with vinegary barbecue sauce. The usual side dish suspects like zingy, crisp coleslaw and deeply smoky baked beans are anything but standard here, complementing the 'cue as they should. For a sweet finish, look no further than pecan bread pudding drizzled with salted caramel-Bourbon sauce.",0,0
1388,Goosefoot,Contemporary,4,"This understated plate-glass façade may seem lost in a sea of mediocrity, but the restaurant it houses is truly distinct. The soothing décor appears minimal, with splashes of orange banquettes, bare tables, and Rodin replicas to fashion a space that is instantly likeable. Menus are made of planting seed paper that guests are encouraged to take home, soak, and use to grow their own wildflowers. Dishes are intricate and take time for the well-versed staff to describe, which may explain the relatively slow pace of dining here. The nine-course menu showcases noteworthy Chef Chris Nugent's classical edge and contemporary artistry. Start with a plump, butter-poached scallop seared until golden, set in a lobster-rich and coconutty sauce with maitake mushrooms and curry spices, surrounded by edible flower petals placed in gels redolent of lemongrass. This may be followed by a unique egg and shell presentation of black garlic custard dotted with shrimp, tucked with an enticingly sharp sprout purée. Superb cheese and dessert courses are a consistent highlight. Goosefoot is still BYO, but an attached wine shop ensures that no one is caught empty-handed. Pay attention to the chocolate lab and market, too.",1,1
1389,Ixcateco Grill,Mexican,2,"Servers stand erect as soldiers at Ixcateco Grill, their pressed white shirts tucked into immaculate black pants. It's a sight you wish you'd see more often-the unmistakable feeling that the staff cares deeply about your experience at this delicious Mexican hot spot. The colorful space, painted in bright shades of orange, green, and fuchsia, only adds to the bonhomie. Chef Anselmo Ramírez, a veteran of Frontera Grill and Topolobampo, knows his way around Southern Mexican food. Try the irresistible picaditas, a pair of tender little masa canoes filled with savory chicken carnitas, pickled cactus, avocado cream, and queso fresco; or the wonderfully complex and authentic pollo en mole negro, sporting that perfect, complex blend of sweet and spicy mole.",0,0
1390,Pearl's Southern Comfort,Southern,2,"Chicago's been on a Southern food kick of late, and this sparkling Andersonville charmer is a straight up hep cat-its enormous arched windows opening up to a completely revamped 100 year-old room featuring long exposed ceiling beams; whitewashed brick; dark slate walls; and soft leather chairs. But even with all that design swag, the main draw at Pearl's Southern Comfort is still the food. For starters, there's their ace barbecue, but guests should hardly stop there. Try the enormous double cut pork chop, grilled to supple perfection and paired with ""dirty"" farro salad, Cajun slaw, and pork jus. Another staple, the Louisiana jambalaya, is served decadently dark and spicy, bobbing with tender chicken, Andouille sausage, and Crystal hot sauce.",0,0
1391,Ombra,Italian,2,"Though it shares a kitchen with next-door gastropub Acre, Ombra is a destination in its own right. Booths patched with recycled leather jackets and ""wallpaper"" of vintage Italian newspapers give the cozy dining room a unique sense of place, and the Italian-inspired cuisine is just as interesting. Diners make quick work of dishes like toothsome farro and mushroom ""arancini,"" deviled eggs kissed with lemon aïoli, or parmesan-dusted meatballs in a chunky tomato sauce. Crispy skin-on whitefish is paired with buttery potatoes and takes a heavenly swim in caper-lemon sauce. Pizzas arrive charred from the wood oven, their dough flavorful and chewy, and creative cocktails like the Chicagroni-modernized with IPA and tea-keep the bar hopping.",0,0
1392,Anteprima,Italian,2,"Nestled into a vibrant strip of shops and eateries, this family-friendly gem is set apart by smart plate-glass windows and olive green-tinted woodwork. Inside, rusticity rules the roost with pressed-tin ceilings and intricate wood paneling. It's the kind of place where even solo patrons feel welcome, especially when perched on a window seat overlooking the bustling street. Following its moniker, diners should ""preview"" the wide-ranging menu before opting for such delights as grilled sardines with sweet fennel, fragrant herbs, and fine olive oil. Delicious pastas include homemade ravioli-filled with a blend of crushed peas and mint-finished with a light, parmesan-flecked sauce. For dessert, a rich, well-made panna cotta wobbles with lemon syrup and zest.",0,0
1393,Big Jones,Southern,2,"Big Jones has all the genteel charm you'd expect from a restaurant specializing in Southern cuisine. Green brocade wallpaper surrounds large framed prints of haunting low-country landscapes. Guests are greeted with a ""Guide to Good Drinking"" upon arrival, featuring barrel-aged punch selections and a lengthy roster of Bourbon and whiskey. Start with whole kernel-studded cornbread and honey butter, a fitting salvo for a meal steeped in Southern tradition. Sweet potato bisque is poured tableside over cornbread croutons, spicy apple chutney, and fried sage. Pickled pork shank and smoked jowl beef up red beans, braised voodoo greens, and aromatic Arkansas rice. An elderberry jelly roll sprinkled with Benne seeds finishes the meal on a classic note.",0,0
1394,Herb,Thai,3,"In the sea of Thai restaurants that flank this area, elegant Herb stands out for its lovely wood and stone décor; and service staff friendly enough to use your name. This is killer Thai, elevated and prepared with care. Herb offers both a three- and six-course prix-fixe dinner at tremendous value, but Chef/owner Patty Neumson's cooking is light (and delicious) enough to go the distance. A sample menu might begin with a cool pile of crunchy green papaya, carrot, and cucumber, laced in a beautifully balanced lime dressing with crispy vermicelli noodles and peanuts. Then move on to tofu and kabocha in a deliciously complex coconut curry full of wilted basil and heat. Soft glass noodles find their match in sautéed onions, fresh crab, and crunchy shrimp.",0,0
1395,Vincent,Belgian,2,"Go Dutch at Vincent, where innovative yet approachable cooking meets a tried-and-true European bistro menu boasting enough cheese to satisfy even the pickiest turophile. Adding to the romance, high-top marble tables and brocade-papered walls make for a warm, intimate ambience that's accented by tall votive candles. Got an appetite? An overflowing pot of P.E.I. mussels is a decadent meal on its own, brimming with bits of pork belly, chilies, scallions, and cilantro and accompanied by a big bowl of traditional frites with mayonnaise. Basil and lemon balsam perk up risotto with charred purple cauliflower and braised fennel. Also, you'll want to hold on to your fork for slices of lemon butter cake with Chantilly cream and blueberry compote.",0,0
1396,Shokran Moroccan Grill,Moroccan,1,"Embrace Moroccan hospitality to the fullest and bone up on your Arabic at Shokran, where the country's culinary culture is displayed in a romantic setting. Nooks and crannies throughout the dining rooms offer intimacy; take a seat among the cozy cushioned banquettes and prepare to say ""shokran"" (thank you) repeatedly as courses come your way. Traditional dishes offer the most authentic experience, like sweet and savory bastilla, a flaky pastry starter that's large enough to serve two, stuffed with spiced chicken and dusted with cinnamon. Famously rustic, the lamb Marrakesh tagine features a meaty bone-in shank adorned with bitter slivers of preserved lemon and surrounded by sweet peas, whole black olives, and tender quartered artichoke hearts.",0,0
1397,Sol de Mexico,Mexican,2,"Far more authentic than the average chips-and-salsa joint, Sol de Mexico brightens the scene and palate with a lively atmosphere (cue the mariachi music!) and delectable house specialties. Walls painted in tropical pinks, blues, and oranges are a cheerful canvas for Dia de los Muertos artifacts. To sample the kitchen's skill, start with sopes surtidos ""xilonen""-four molded masa cups with a variety of fillings like caramelized plantains doused in sour cream or tender black beans topped with crumbly house-made chorizo. Then, move on to the pollo en mole manchamanteles, which translates to ""tablecloth stainer."" Rich and slightly bitter with a comforting nuttiness, the aptly named mahogany sauce begs to be sopped up with freshly made tortillas.",0,0
1398,Jin Thai,Thai,1,"In-the-know locals fill up on tasty Thai at this sleek corner hot spot, whose curving glass windows beckon many a passerby with views of and aromas from vibrant curries and spicy laab. Inside, a row of splashy pillows lends color and comfort to a wooden banquette, and woven placemats dress up dark wood tables. Start a meal with zingy miang kum, a chopped mix of dried shrimp, fresh ginger and lime, peanuts, and coconut, all wrapped in a betel leaf. From there, move on to hot curry catfish or Sukothai noodle soup teeming with minced pork and steaming broth (add pinches of warm spices from the accompanying condiment tray for an even more soul-satisfying slurp). For dessert, pick from either roti ice cream, wonton bananas, or warm Thai custard.",0,0
1399,Noon-O-Kabab,Persian,1,"A bustling lunch crowd appreciates the welcoming hospitability at this family-run Persian favorite in the upper reaches of Humboldt Park. Intricate tilework and patterned wall hangings offset the closely set linen-topped tables and add touches of elegance to the homey space. A basket of warm pita bread and a bowl of salty Bulgarian feta, parsley, and raw onions sate the appetites of those perusing the kababs on the menu. Succulent, hand-formed lamb koubideh and beef tenderloin skewers are juicy and charred with a hint of spice, and vegetarian offerings like tadiq with ghormeh sabzi play up the textural contrast of crispy pan-browned saffron rice against flavorful stewed spinach. Sample a glass of ""awesome"" house Earl Grey tea steeped with cardamom and ginger.",0,0
1400,Taste of Thai Town,Thai,1,"Well-regarded Thai restaurateur Arun Sampanthavivat expands his influence with this long-awaited second sibling, a casual and welcoming gathering place housed in a former police station. The menu showcases a taste of each of Thailand's diverse regions, though many diners will be familiar with the offerings on hand. The mouthwatering aromas of each dish are matched in many cases by eye-watering spice. Pad see ew retain their chewy bite when tossed with crisp veggies like gai lan and green beans, and is served with a caddy of sugar, pickled jalapeños, and chili sauce to customize your preferred level of heat and sweet. A cup of pepper pork curry, the chef's specialty, bobs with tender pork belly in a balanced and sumptuous turmeric-tinged sauce.",0,0
1401,Ras Dashen,Ethiopian,2,"Take the hostess up on her offer to sit at a traditional table and enjoy Ras Dashen's Ethiopian items in a truly authentic environment. Cushioned rattan chairs surrounding low mossab tables with conical domed lids await communal trays arriving from the kitchen. The bar serves Ethiopian honey wine, African beers, and cocktails like the rosy champagne qay arafa for those who want to fully immerse themselves in the culinary culture. Delicately crisp, lentil-stuffed sambusas whet the appetite for doro wat, the national dish of Ethopia, which does its country proud with aromatic and tender braised chicken in a sumptuous berbere sauce. Sides of warm ib cheese, freshly made from buttermilk, and spongy injera cool the palate from the creeping heat.",0,0
1402,Chicago Kalbi,Korean,2,"Take me out to the ballgame-or the Korean barbecue joint where a ballplayer would feel right at home. At this quirky spot, autographed baseballs line the shelves, while photographs and posters of ballplayers paper the walls. But the cluttered décor doesn't deter locals from frequenting this modest yet welcoming joint. Gas grills at each table give off an intoxicatingly savory perfume as patrons take their time searing their choice of well-marbled marinated beef, including the always-popular bulgogi or kalbi, and then cool their mouths with a traditional array of banchan. For those who prefer their meat raw, beef tartare assumes an interesting twist of flavor and texture when folded with Asian pears, sesame seeds, and sesame oil.",0,0
1403,Community Tavern,Steakhouse,2,"Created by restaurateur Quay Tao as a lively respite with a touch of sophisticated comfort, Community Tavern is true to its title. Inside, Portage Park locals take up every inch of space at the modern wooden bar and communal tables. A bistro-inspired menu takes luxurious liberties with tradition, as evidenced in the foie gras-whipped butter served with biscuits or pound cake made even richer with brown butter. Steak frites are no less appealing for their straightforward plating-a classic combination of juicy skirt steak and thin-cut potatoes with garlic aïoli for dipping. To really indulge, pair it with a side of cremini mushrooms, quartered, roasted, and sautéed in umami-spiked steak jus with a sprinkle of fried sweet shallots.",0,0
1404,The Angry Crab,Seafood,2,"Don't be shellfish-bring friends, beer, and wine to dinner at The Angry Crab for a messy, more-the-merrier experience. Lines form nightly for the chance to fill up on a Cajun-style spread shot through with Vietnamese flavors that reflect the owners' heritage. Order from the laminated menus or the large overhead chalkboard for a seafood feast with options like whole head-on shrimp or enormous snow crab legs. Choose from a choice of lemon, garlic, or spicy sauces, stake your claim on a roll of paper towels and a seat at the communal tables, and then rip open the plastic bags in which the seafood arrives and dig in with your claws. Still hungry? Make it a true crab boil and add sausage, corn on the cob, and red bliss potatoes to round out the meal.",0,0
1405,Ssyal Ginseng House,Korean,1,"With Ssyal Ginseng House's invigorating samgyetang at their doorstep, it's a wonder anyone in Albany Park ever gets sick. Since 1993, the sunny spot has served this restorative dish, featuring an entire Cornish game hen stuffed with glutinous rice, jujubes, and whole garlic cloves in an earthenware bowl of delicately flavored ginseng broth. Equal care and skill goes into the rest of the Korean specialties on offer, all of which are presented with kind, attentive service. Oden ttuck-bok-gi is piled high in a chewy mix of thin fish cake strips, glutinous rice cakes, and shredded carrots and cabbage tossed in sweet and spicy red pepper paste. For an immunity boost in your own kitchen, take home some of Ssyal's house-dried ginseng or ginger candies.",0,0
1406,Taste of Peru,Peruvian,1,"Tucked inside a strip-mall and entirely plain-Jane in appearance, foodies trek to this caliente fave for a formidable meal of authentic dishes. The owner is chatty and tunes groovy, all of which make for a wonderful precursor to such peppery items as aji de gallina (shredded chicken in a walnut sauce, enriched with parmesan) or chupe de camarones (a hot, spicy, bright bowl of shrimp and rice). This is clearly not the place for a pisco sour, but feels like Sundays con la familia where papa a la huancaina doused in amarillo chile, and arroz chaufa with veggies and beef jerky-like strips are merely some of the items on offer. It's worth noting though that while the food is decidedly traditional, mysteriously there's no pork to be found anywhere on the menu.",0,0
1407,Gogi,Korean,2,"The surging popularity of Korean food continues to flourish along these shores of Lake Michigan; and as foodies would have you know, Gogi is one of the best places in the city to experience it. With its hip, industrial décor, imposing exhaust fans over each table (a clear sign that there's a ton of grilling going on), and lively palate of sweet, spicy, and sour, dinner here promises to be a sensory explosion like no other. One could feast on the abundant pre-meal banchan alone-a stunning selection of kimchi, mirin-soaked fish cakes, sake-steamed black beans, and more. But, that would mean missing out on delicate slices of sirloin bulgogi smothered in a sweet, gingery marinade; or restorative, spicy sundubu jjigae bubbling away in an iron pot.",0,0
1408,Arya Bhavan,Indian,1,"Devon Avenue is rife with spots to sate Indo-Pakistani cravings, including dozens of longtime restaurants, catering halls, and markets serving curry, kebabs, and tandoori chicken. But Arya Bhavan stands out with personal, family-friendly service and fresh, carefully prepared Indian cuisine that also just happens to boast a few buzzwords (namely, vegan, organic, and gluten-free), Even omnivores won't be able to resist the mixed basket appetizer, a substantial platter of tasty street snacks like tamarind-stuffed mirch pakora and spicy lemon-kissed potato vada. A classic rendition of garlicky, gingery palak dal blends hearty yellow lentils and fresh spinach. To finish the meal, take the plunge and reward your palate with outstanding avocado ice cream.",0,0
1409,Sabri Nihari,Indian,1,"Sabri Nihari outshines the restaurant competition on this crowded stretch of West Devon Avenue. A recent expansion has doubled the size of the posh Indo-Pakistani spot, where crystal chandeliers make gold-hued walls gleam more brightly. As with many Southeast Asian restaurants, vegetarian dishes abound-but that's only the beginning of the expansive menu. Whole okra pods add grassy, peppery bite to beefy bhindi gosht, and delightful chicken charga, an entire spatchcocked bird marinated in yogurt and lime, is rubbed generously with spices before crisping up in the deep fryer. No alcohol is served in deference to many of the abstaining clientele, but you won't miss it; buttery naan and creamy lassi with homemade yogurt help to balance out the spice-fest.",0,0
1410,Viceroy of India,Indian,1,"The periwinkle and lavender walls, sky-blue ceiling painted with clouds, and steely booths lining the spacious dining room at Viceroy of India keep things cool, letting the spice-inflected cuisine churned out by the kitchen provide the heat. White linen-draped tables as well as a full bar and wine list make this West Rogers Park retreat a regal choice. Though an à la carte menu is available for those who've got to get their fill of tandoori chicken, longtime patrons and lunch regulars make a beeline for the popular lunch buffet, stocked with North Indian standards like pakoras, samosas, saag paneer, chicken makhani, and goat curry. Complimentary naan is available by the basketful. The grab-and-go café next door lets passersby get their sweet fix.",0,0
1411,Mela Tandoori Kitchen,Indian,2,"If ""mela"" means ""fair"" in Hindi, then Tandoori Kitchen is aptly named. As fun and lively as a carnival, this welcoming spot sports brightly striped walls and colorful splashes of paint set aglow by stylish pendant lights. Its menu displays a vast litany of eats, and obliging servers are happy to lend a hand with useful recommendations. The overwhelming lunch buffet is a hit among office workers for hot, crispy samosas with sweet tamarind chutney, or fiery tandoori wings baked until smoky and juicy. The area takes a bit of a dive at sunset, but that doesn't curb this kitchen's appeal. Families keep coming to devour huge portions of aloo gobi in an onion-and-tomato masala along with intensely spicy lamb vindaloo-and inevitably leave toting leftovers.",0,0
1412,Pläj,Scandinavian,2,"NorCal is short on the Scandinavian-inspired fare that's all the rage right now, so it's no wonder why Bay Area foodies flock to this upscale spot. Steps from the opera, symphony, and ballet, Plaj has caught on like wildfire with the pre-theater crowd, who congregate at the linen-topped tables and cozy bar for a taste of Californian cuisine mingled with Nordic flair. Swedish-born Chef/owner Roberth Sundell offers smart riffs on classic dishes, from a tender duo of potato dumplings accented with brown butter, caramelized onions, and bacon to deep-red seared elk medallions set in a woodsy juniper jus and accented by tart lingonberries. For dessert, a parfait-like take on princess cake, with layers of raspberry, sponge cake, and marzipan, is worthy of royalty.",0,0
1413,Jardinière,Californian,3,"For a memorable night on the town, don your best dress, find a hand to hold, and head to this longtime favorite-tinged with a sense of bygone romance. Stop off at the circular bar and join the well-heeled couples sipping cocktails pre- or post-opera. Prime seats on the upstairs balcony overlook the bustling lower level, and stunning arched windows show off views of the street. Approachable, seasonal dishes abound on Jardinière's menu, from tender tajarin pasta with morel mushrooms and butter to a Mediterranean-inspired duo of lamb belly and shoulder with fresh fava beans and smoked yogurt sauce. Indecisive sweet tooths will thrill to the bonne bouche, an array of candies, cookies, small cakes, and profiteroles that makes a striking conclusion.",0,0
1414,Brenda's,Southern,2,"Big portions and even bigger flavors are the draw at this taste of New Orleans, helmed by Louisiana-bred Chef/owner Brenda Buenviaje. Chicken étouffée offers a smoky, dark roux packed with vegetables, while a flawless muffuletta is packed with savory meat, provolone, and spicy olive salad (it's great with an ice-cold Abita beer). Sweet and salty golden beignets, filled with cheesy crawfish or molten Ghirardelli chocolate, could be a meal on their own. The Tenderloin address is rough around the edges, but Brenda's interior is quite lovely, with a light-filled dining room, bright murals, and high ceilings. Count on a wait here now that the secret is out, particularly at lunch and brunch. Or, check out the equally delicious sequel, Brenda's Meat & Three.",0,0
1415,Boxing Room,Southern,2,"A trip to the real-life Big Easy may be short on veggies (unless fried okra counts), but northern California balances the Cajun and Creole indulgences on offer at this lively restaurant, leading to dishes like a spicy-sweet fig and arugula salad with spiced pecans and pan-seared goat cheese. Casual and sleek, it draws business types for lunch and happy hour, when they cluster around the oyster bar with beers and boiled peanuts. All the classics can be found here including gumbo, fried alligator, and a perfect jambalaya studded with spicy andouille and tender roasted duck. The simple and high-ceilinged dining room encourages lingering-as does the airy angel-food ""strawberry shortcake"" with lemon verbena ice cream and tangy whipped yogurt.",0,0
1416,Absinthe,Mediterranean,3,"The original colonist of Hayes Valley's now-bustling restaurant row, this ""green fairy"" still has plenty of sparkle, thanks to its timeless brasserie atmosphere and classic French- and Mediterranean-inspired menu. Even a lowly chicken breast gets the magic treatment here, with crunchy skin, perfectly wilted lacinato kale, and swirls of luscious Bourbon-yam purée. The same goes for a little gem lettuce salad with fine herbs dressed in a red wine-shallot vinaigrette. Perched between formal and casual, the restaurant draws relaxed alfresco lunchers with dogs by day and stylish symphony or opera patrons by night. In either incarnation, it's a lovely place for a cocktail-a few may earn you a wink from those fairies, flitting across the dining room mural.",0,0
1417,Monsieur Benjamin,French,3,"Chef Corey Lee's take on timeless bistro cuisine is as sleek and striking as the space it's served in. Fit for the cover of a magazine, this black-and-white dining room's minimalist, yet intimate décor is trumped only by its piece de resistance: an exhibition kitchen where you'll find the meticulous brigade of cooks hard at work, producing impressively authentic French food. Begin with the pâté de Campagne, enhanced with liver and shallots and presented with strong mustard, cornichons, and country bread. The Arctic char amandine is excellent, dressed with fragrant beurre noisette and served over a bed of crispy haricot verts and sunchoke. For a sweet and fruity finish, purists will delight in the dessert menu's crêpe façon gâteau.",0,0
1418,Alta CA,Californian,2,"Though this hip techie gathering place is relaxed at lunch-it wouldn't be uncommon to see diners pecking away at their laptops-it's the place to be after work. There, in the shadow of the Twitter building across the street and beneath a massive floor-to-ceiling shelf loaded with bottles, sharply attired CEOs and hoodied engineers congregate for cocktails at the triangular bar. The Eastern European-influenced menu kicks off with drinking snacks like wispy, savory beef tendon puffs, then moves into hearty plates like pierogies, beef stroganoff, and house-cured pastrami stuffed inside soft, chewy bialys. And when it comes to dessert, even the most plugged-in programmers will put away their iPhones for a bite of the creamy lemon and poppy seed sundae.",0,0
1419,Rusty's Southern,Southern,2,"In the hard-charging techie wilds of San Francisco, homesick transplants can find Southern comfort at this Tenderloin newbie, which eschews fine-dining frills for rib-sticking simplicity. Its environs are a bit sketchy after dark, but that doesn't deter the young and stylish crowds, who swill craft beers at the front bar and congregate in groups in the casual, wood-accented dining room. Rustic and homey treats arrive in abundant portions: tangy, smoky Brunswick stew is loaded with pork, chicken, collards, lima beans and tomatoes, while expertly brined fried chicken is encased in a crunchy, golden-brown breading. For a snack, the fluffy fried hush puppies come equipped with a decadent pimento-ranch dipping sauce, and pair nicely with an icy sweet tea.",0,0
1420,Rich Table,Contemporary,2,"Its rustic-chic décor, highlighting reclaimed and raw wood, gives Rich Table a farmhouse feel, and the crowds that pack it are equally shabby-sleek. Reserve early or expect a long wait, as there's serious competition for seats that quickly fill with young professionals in designer casualwear. The contemporary American food from Chef/owners Evan and Sarah Rich is highly engaging with menu mainstays like crispy sardine chips and porcini-salted doughnuts set alongside a warm raclette dip. Snap peas are arranged beside grapefruit segments, pecans, and nasturtium blossoms; while seasonal mains include a tangy strawberry gazpacho topped with crunchy chicken skin and burrata. Also irresistable is a smoky pork chop posed atop wheat berries and pork-garum jus.",0,0
1421,Domo,Japanese,2,"This Hayes Valley sushi joint is roughly the size of a shoebox, with only a dozen stools and a pair of sidewalk tables to choose from. Reservations aren't accepted, which means there's almost always a wait (make the most of it by perusing the daily specials on the mirror). Once seated, you'll likely have a few hungry diners eyeing your spot, so don't bring a group or plan to linger. For your trouble, you'll be rewarded with straightforward, high-quality sushi, whether you opt for simply prepared salmon and albacore nigiri (with well-seasoned rice) or the elaborate Domo roll, a baked California version with salmon, scallops, mayo, unagi glaze, tobiko, and scallions. To spice things up, try the lemon juice- and jalapeño-spiked hamachi maki.",0,0
1422,Huxley,American,2,"Tattooed industry types can't get enough of this itsy-bitsy Tenderloin bistro, where the industrious young chef prepares every plate herself in the slip of a kitchen. With its warm wood surfaces, art deco accents, and vintage etched mirrors, it's an engaging place to pull up a counter seat-you'll feel like she's cooking just for you. The menu is all about high-quality American comfort fare, like avocado toast with a creamy uni mousse and umami-rich nori powder; tender, caramelized pork belly tossed with sprouted lentils and pea tendrils; and a superb chicken pot pie, its flaky, buttery crust infused with black pepper. Desserts are limited, but a simple buttermilk-vanilla ice cream with caramelized honeycomb candy hits all the right notes.",0,0
1423,Tadu,Ethiopian,1,"Strength in numbers is the way to go when planning a visit to this charming Ethiopian newcomer: its neighborhood is one in which you won't want to walk alone, and besides, you'll need all the help you can get to tackle the hearty portions, all served family-style here. Despite its bleak environs, Tadu's cheerful décor and friendly, engaging staff make for a very warm welcome. Rev up your palate with the spicy, golden-brown sambussas, filled with earthy lentils and caramelized onions. Then go full-throttle with the kitfo, a zippy mixture of ground beef, onion, jalapeño, and Ethiopian spices. There's plenty of fluffy, slightly sour injera to mellow the burn: you can even enjoy it cooked with spices and vegetables in the delightful firfir.",0,0
1424,Zuni Café,Mediterranean,2,"Over thirty years young and still thriving as if it were newborn, locals and visitors remain drawn to this SF institution, famous for its laid-back California vibe and great, locally sourced eats. This iconic space embraces its unique shape, and is styled with bold artwork-covered walls, a copper bar counter, and wood-burning oven sending out delightful pizzas and filling the room with mouthwatering aromas. Given its ace location, Zuni makes for a divine lunch destination-and proof is in the many business folk, trendy ladies-who-lunch, and tourists that fill its tables midday. Menu treasures include sliced persimmon scattered with shaved Jerusalem artichoke and baby arugula leaves, tailed by toothsome artisanal rigatoni clutching fragrant lamb sugo.",0,0
1425,Tycoon,Thai,1,"Its location in the gritty Tenderloin doesn't offer much in terms of ambience, but this Thai newcomer makes up for it with flavorful, fragrant cooking that's a cut above the standard pad Thai racket. You'll swoon for the utterly perfect sai ua, juicy, smoky pork sausages bursting with the aromas of makrut lime, lemongrass, and chili, and the delectable pad ped, a spicy coconut-milk curry loaded with piquant green peppercorns, tender tofu, eggplant, and bell pepper. For true culinary adventurers, there's a small selection of Laotian dishes, like pad mee lao or thin rice noodles with chicken, fresh mint, and a splash of earthy black bean sauce. Also notable is the unusual and authentic drink selection, which includes vibrant pandan and chrysanthemum juices.",0,0
1426,AQ,Contemporary,3,"Like its once-sketchy, increasingly tech-centric SoMa corridor, this chic Californian restaurant is aiming for the stars-and even if it doesn't always succeed, it's certainly never a dull ride. Whether you opt for the four-course or tasting menu, you'll be wowed by flavor combos that are always intriguing and often breathtaking: think silky-sweet scallop crudo with white sesame and pineapple, earthy beets with snap peas and lavender ice cream, and black cod with clam butter. AQ's hyperseasonal menus are gently accented by a quarterly décor shakeup; depending on the time of year, you'll find cherry blossoms or fall leaves accenting the sleek, neutral space. Be sure to come early to enjoy one of the exceptional cocktails at the front bar.",0,0
1427,Una Pizza Napoletana,Pizza,2,"In keeping with owner Anthony Mangieri's monastic devotion to the perfect pie, Una Pizza Napoletana is a spare space, housed in a chilly former garage on an industrial corner of SoMa. The vibe is completely casual yet alluring with crowds riveted by the altar-a tiled turquoise oven, where Mangieri stretches dough and deftly coaxes the crackling wood fire to produce his perfect pies. Their blistered and puffy crusts sport a delicious char as well as an addictively chewy texture thanks to tangy fermentation. Waits are long, but the hassle is well worth it after one bite of the Filetti, slathered with creamy buffalo mozzarella and juicy cherry tomatoes. Mangieri is unquestionably a master of his craft, and his pies are a cut above local competition.",0,0
1428,Modern Thai,Thai,1,"""Modern"" is a bit of a misnomer, as this tropical Thai retreat actually feels like a step back in time with its whitewashed colonial façade, linen-topped tables, and rattan chairs. But the anachronism also applies to the portions (incredibly generous) and prices (incredibly reasonable), making it a favorite for nine-to-fivers seeking an affordable lunch break. Sweet and spicy Thai flavors abound here, from warm salads of glass noodles and minced chicken with a fish sauce-lime vinaigrette to comforting noodle soups like the khao soy, with chicken and egg noodles in a rich yellow coconut curry. And the MT sundae, a combo of coconut ice cream, sugar palm fruit, red beans, and jackfruit, is a refreshing dessert perfect for lunchtime dining.",0,0
1429,1601 Bar & Kitchen,Sri Lankan,2,"The flavors of India and Asia infuse the creative dishes at this quiet winner, which blends Eastern and Western ingredients to arrive at its very own delicious concoctions. A decidedly untraditional lamprais might stuff a classically French bacon-wrapped rabbit loin, toasted buckwheat, and eggplant curry into a banana leaf. Meanwhile, the halibut ""ceviche"" is more like a flavored sashimi, with hints of coconut milk and rings of serrano chilies. The sleek, contemporary space with its wraparound windows, lovely art, and slate walls, is a perfect showcase for the food. Dine solo at the bar with a bittersweet Dubonnet sangria, or come with a group to share dishes and bottles of wine at the communal table-the polished staff makes either experience enjoyable.",0,0
1430,Pampalasa,Filipino,1,"""Pampalasa"" is Tagalog for ""to add flavor,"" and that's precisely what this new Filipino restaurant has done to this industrial stretch of Folsom Street. With sunny yellow walls and lots of Filipino artwork, it has a casual, island-party vibe. Adding to the fun, you're encouraged to dine kamayan-style (with your hands); there's a sink in the center of the room for easy cleanup. Kick things off with the tocino sliders, rich vinegar-soy marinated pork topped with garlicky lechon sauce on a pillowy pan de sal bun. From there, the savory, moist chicken adobo awaits, atop garlic rice with tiny dried shrimp. (Ask for a side of hot sauce and banana ketchup for even more flavor.) Deep-fried banana spring rolls with calamansi coconut cream are a sweet finish.",0,0
1431,Kiss,Japanese,3,"In a sea of trendy and flashy Japanese restaurants, this mom-and-pop standby sometimes gets drowned out-but one taste of its top-quality fish will have you hooked for life. Traditional nigiri, ranging from giant clam and halibut to bluefin tuna, arrives minimally dressed and served atop excellent rice. Appealing non-sushi options include a delicate chawan mushi filled with flaky white fish and buttery ginkgo berries, with an umami-rich dashi. Adjacent to Japantown's Peace Plaza, tiny Kiss is easy to miss (look for the sign on the door), and reservations are recommended. Expect a quiet, sparse, and decorous atmosphere, with polite service from the husband-and-wife owners. The contemplative vibe encourages savoring each delicious morsel.",0,0
1432,Liholiho Yacht Club,Hawaiian,3,"This charming, highly personal newcomer delightfully reflects Chef/owner Ravi Kapur's patchwork upbringing-blending Hawaiian, Indian, Asian, and Californian influences into its own unique cuisine. Blue entryway tiles spelling ""ALOHA"" lead to a bustling bar, a sunny-yellow exhibition kitchen, as well as a sleek dining room, all attended to by exceptionally hospitable servers. A refreshing Clifton special cocktail (with genever and coconut water) is the perfect counterpart to intriguing snacks like silky tuna poke atop crunchy nori crackers, smoky beef tongue wrapped in fluffy clamshell buns, and Flintstone-sized beef ribs in a sweet-spicy red chili sauce. Be sure to save room for the tangy, dense cardamom cheesecake with pistachio and Cara Cara oranges.",0,0
1433,Octavia,Californian,3,"Chef/owner Melissa Perello, already a local culinary personality with Frances, shines even brighter at this new sequel in the tony Lower Pacific Heights neighborhood. Packed with a dynamic and diverse group of diners, the airy and open space is designed with a minimalist-chic eye, from the white-tiled kitchen to those raw-wood benches lined with wool-encased pillows. Service is enthusiastic and genuinely hospitable. Chef Perello has a gift for elevating straightforward dishes through the use of pristine ingredients and technique, and her magic is in full force here with dishes like golden saffron fettuccine twirled with caramelized garlic, wilted fennel, and roasted tomatoes. Luscious roasted king salmon with fingerling potatoes in a dill-infused crème fraîche sauce may seem basic, but in her hands, it's anything but. Even a simple grilled toast, with warm, creamy house-made ricotta and charred spring onion, is revelatory. At Octavia, the golden touch extends to the exquisite desserts, which might include a nectarine ""float"" with nectarine ice cream and soda, mint, and lavender, and the thoughtful wine list brims with unusual options. With food and furnishings this captivating, tables fill early, so be sure to reserve well in advance.",1,1
1434,Aveline,Contemporary,3,"Snap-happy Instagrammers will delight in this contemporary stunner in the Warwick Hotel, where the Hollywood Regency-style room and exquisitely arranged plates are picture-perfect. Located steps from the busy shopping corridor of Union Square, it's a great spot to unwind with a refreshing, bubbly cocktail-either over a full meal or a snack at adjoining bar, The European. The kitchen's artful creations include a spiraling arrangement of house-smoked salmon with ribbons of lightly pickled vegetables and avocado purée, or a crispy duck leg resting atop charred Brussels sprouts, cherry, and parsnip. Don't miss the menu's chief attraction: delicate, buttery crab ""macarons"" or tiny sandwiches filled with an ample portion of creamy, herb-flecked crab salad.",0,0
1435,Kin Khao,Thai,2,"Don't let its covert location fool you-Kin Khao is a flagrantly delicious and very distinctive dining room. The décor is unexceptional by no uncertain terms, but really nobody seems to care, as the cooking-punctuated by Californian elements and welcome seasonality-is the real deal. Northern Thai is what this kitchen is all about and pad Thai-loving palates should vacate these premises...pronto. Of course, the unique menu reads like a veritable thesis on Isaan food mingled with California love. Then there's the easygoing and chill staff who never miss a beat-as they bestow tables with vibrant, product-driven plates. These have included crispy lima beans tossed in nam tok followed by crunchy albeit not as ""hot"" chicken wings massaged with tamarind and chili. Pork meatballs seasoned with garlic and lemongrass (laab tod) are enriched by a phenomenal chili (jaew) sauce; while a gorgeous platter of crunchy vegetables is accompanied by a jar of the incredible nam prik (potent with shrimp paste) layered with caramelized pork jowl, fried catfish, and a salted duck egg. Panang curry with tender-braised duck is a champ among palates less valiant. Closing arguments may reveal that this is a truly Thai kitchen turning out insanely memorable food. All objections overruled.",1,1
1436,54 Mint,Italian,2,"With its largely Italian waitstaff and clientele, a meal at 54 Mint is the next best thing to a plane ticket to Rome. A happy respite from the neighborhood's hustle and bustle, the space boasts a contemporary dining room stocked with shelves of Italian ingredients and a surprisingly tranquil front patio facing Mint Plaza. The food is an authentic culinary journey through the Eternal City, with favorites like perfectly al dente bucatini all'amatriciana, twirled with smoked pancetta, sweet onion, tomato, and chili. The must-order suppli, fried balls of tomato risotto stuffed with smoked mozzarella, are best described as arancini on steroids. For dessert? The buttery, dark chocolate-flecked ricotta tart will leave you feeling molto buono.",0,0
1437,Manora's Thai Cuisine,Thai,1,"A firmly rooted dining destination in this otherwise underdeveloped part of town, Manora's has been a source for authentic Thai dishes since the '80s. Crowds flock here for the affordable lunch specials, which include gems like pad Thai topped with plump shrimp and a golden fried egg, fragrant lemon chicken soup, and moist, perfectly charred satay skewers surrounded by fresh vegetables. The pace at dinner is more relaxed, with endearing service that makes customers truly feel at home amid the wood carvings of the dining room. The fresh, zingy flavors of dishes like spicy green papaya salad draw diners through the well-aged wooden door again and again. Meals are all the better when cooled off with a creamy cold coffee or sweet Thai iced tea.",0,0
1438,Bar Agricole,Californian,2,"Cocktails and conversation are always a pleasure at Bar Agricole, which is known for having one of the city's best drink programs. Its narrow, industrial-modern dining room boasts soaring ceilings from which huge acrylic sculptures hang, while mod concrete booths line the side wall. An outdoor patio, with plant beds and a trickling fountain, is particularly popular for brunch. The menu is thoroughly Californian and loaded with the season's best, showcased in dishes like a frisée, arugula, and radish salad with a citronette dressing; halibut brandade with asparagus; as well as roast pork leg and belly with Canario beans, greens, and horseradish. At brunch, opt for flavorful, tender, and homemade lamb sausage served over fried eggs and wilted kale.",0,0
1439,The Progress,Contemporary,3,"The sequel to mega-popular State Bird Provisions, located right next door, has retained all of its sibling's inventiveness while moving things forward (hence the name) in a more restrained, elegant way. Set in a 100-year-old former theater, the retro-industrial space is a real looker, with attentive, thoughtful service and exceptional wine and cocktails to boot. Diners are encouraged to team up to savor the ""choose-your-own-adventure"" feast, which allows a choice of six courses from a list of about 20. The enticing array of dishes includes ""potstickers"" filled with triple-cream cheese and peas, spice-rubbed grilled squab with salted chili paste, and earthy poppy-seed cake with mascarpone, pistachio paste, and strawberries for dessert.",0,0
1440,State Bird Provisions,American,2,"The crowds start queuing up long before State Bird Provisions swings open its doors, with excited guests hoping to score one of their few dozen walk-in spots (you can also make reservations, but the process is still a coup). The buzzing and open kitchen located up front is the focal point of the space. The energy is palpable, and a night out at this popular spot can feel (in the best way possible) like you've scored a ticket to a very cool party. The bright, industrial-chic dining room features countrified yet sleek wooden tables; and playful pegboard walls showcasing intricate wire sculptures. The easygoing army of servers roll the kitchen's seasonal American small plates around dim sum-style on trolleys (or carry it by foot), showcasing each menu item with an accompanying price tag. It's hard not to want a taste of everything on offer, which is probably even more reason to come with as many friends as you can rally. A quenelle of rich squab liver pâté is spread on sweet almond cakes; while plump Guinea Hen dumplings are served in a fragrant hen broth. Then, a flaky, croissant-like wheat bread gets a creamy hit of burrata and thump of crushed black pepper; and ultra-fresh sweet peas are paired with spicy horseradish cream and fried parsnip chips.",1,1
1441,398 Brasserie,French,3,"Skip the Union Square tourist traps and head for this newcomer in the Hotel G, where the French-accented fare is a step up from the neighboring options. Distressed pillars and ceiling panels give the interior a demolition-chic vibe, but contemporary chandeliers, sleek furniture, and a gleaming exhibition kitchen make the chaos feel flashy, not funky. The cocktail crowd descends early here, and for good reason: the drinks are outstanding, and pair well with the kitchen's Euro-American cuisine. Try the classic Lyonnaise salad of frisée, poached egg, crisp bacon lardons, and duck prosciutto, or the tender duck confit with cremini mushroom fricassee. If it's available, the wood-roasted calamari with smoked peppers and chorizo is not to be missed.",0,0
1442,The Cavalier,Gastropub,2,"One of the city's high-profile openings, this is the third effort from the team behind Marlowe and Park Tavern. Everything here has a British bent, echoed in the hunting-lodge-gone-sophisticated décor with red-and-blue walls accented by taxidermied trophies and tufted banquettes. Across-the-pond classics have Californian twists like a deep-fried Scotch duck egg wrapped in truffled duck rillettes. The restaurant has quickly become a see-and-be-seen haunt of the tech oligarchy (complete with a private club). However, the food is comforting and homey as seen in a caramelized roast chicken set atop horseradish mash. Though reservations are a must, its location in Hotel Zetta means service runs from morning to night, giving diners plenty of options.",0,0
1443,Tin Vietnamese,Vietnamese,2,"The modern atmosphere at this hip downtowner might conjure thoughts of misguided fusion fare, but rest assured: when it comes to food, Tin is as traditional as it gets. Nonetheless, the dark wood walls, sleek glass pendant lights, and rich wood furnishings are a welcome change, making the spot a draw for groups residing far beyond its gritty, largely industrial neighborhood. High-quality ingredients are the secret that sets this kitchen's cooking apart-from crunchy threads of banana blossom tossed with fried eel, shallots, peanuts, and herbs, to smoky soy-lemongrass pork shoulder atop rice noodles with a spicy lime-chili dipping sauce. Throw in some crunchy imperial rolls and garlicky, peppery wok-tossed shaking beef, and you'll have an affordable feast.",0,0
1444,Dosa,Indian,2,"Grandeur and glamour infuse every inch of this stylish restaurant, whose soaring ceilings and glittering crystal chandeliers complement the boldly flavored, fragrantly spiced fare. As the name suggests, dosas are a highlight, with crisp exteriors, spicy fillings, and excellent accompanying sambar and chutney. Welcoming servers will help translate street favorites like bhel puri (a delicious sweet-spicy blend of puffed rice, crispy noodles, green mango, and chutney); or shake up a tangy Bengali gimlet with gin, curried nectar, and lime. Desserts are every bit as exotic as the rest of the menu and include rasmalai-delicate patties of fresh cheese in sweet cream flavored with cardamom and rosewater. Find a second, smaller location on Valencia Street.",0,0
1445,M. Y. China,Chinese,2,"Need proof that Yan Can Cook? Just snag a table at the famed PBS chef's elegant restaurant. Housed under the dome of the Westfield San Francisco Centre shopping mall, M.Y. China is a dark, sultry space full of posh Chinese furniture, antiques, and dramatic lighting. Shopping-weary patrons fill the dining room; whereas chowhounds hit the exhibition counter to watch the staff masterfully hand-pull noodles and toss woks. The menu reads like an ode to regional Chinese cuisine, spanning chewy scissor-cut noodles with wild boar, fluffy bao stuffed with sweet and smoky barbecue pork, and, when it's in season, delectable pepper-dusted whole crab. Be sure to order strategically, as you'll want room for the flaky, buttery, creamy, and outright superb Macanese egg tarts.",0,0
1446,Acquerello,Italian,4,"With its air of old-world sophistication, Acquerello is the kind of establishment where one dresses for dinner, which is always an occasion. The room feels embellished yet comfortable, with vaulted wood-beamed ceilings, warm terra-cotta walls, and contemporary paintings. It's the kind of place where celebrants of a certain age are happy to splurge on a white truffle-tasting menu. Each prix-fixe here promises expertise and finesse, with a carefully curated wine list to match. Count yourself lucky if your meal begins with a silky parmesan budino topped with micro-herbs and lettuces in vinaigrette, surrounded by fragrant pearls of black truffle gelée. Pastas must not be missed, such as the lobster-filled raviolo in smoked butter-lobster jus. Decadent risotti may arrive topped with Taleggio, velvety egg yolk, compressed radicchio and herbaceous nasturtium leaves to cut the richness. A perfectly pink duck breast with sunflower seed-huckleberry relish, Nantes carrots, and pink peppercorn-duck jus adds just the right note of rusticity. Save room for one of the best mignardises carts you will ever encounter, stocked with superlative house-made chocolates, macarons, pâtes de fruits, and caramels.",2,1
1447,Shizen,Vegan,2,"At first glance, this stylish izakaya and sushi bar could be another in a line of similar places that dot the San Francisco landscape, were it not for a major twist: everything on the menu is vegan. Purists and die-hard carnivores may scoff, but the food is exceptional, skillfully manipulating vegetables and starches to recreate seafood-centric Japanese favorites. Spicy tuna gets a run for its money from the impressive spicy tofuna rolls, with chili-inflected minced tofu and cucumber crowned with creamy avocado and dusted in chili ""tobiko."" A yuba salad with miso dressing and tempura-battered shiitake mushrooms stuffed with faux-crab are equally compelling. Throw in a sleek, contemporary setting, and Shizen is a winner for eaters of all stripes.",0,0
1448,Thep Phanom,Thai,2,"A good Thai spot is as essential to a SF neighborhood as air to breath, and Lower Haighters have long pledged their allegiance to Thep Phanom's interpretation of the sweet and spicy cuisine. Whether they crave sinfully crisp, golden-brown chicken wings with sweet-chili dipping sauce or a range of healthy vegetarian options, they've yet to be disappointed. Tucked just off bustling Haight and Fillmore, the location is no friend to drivers (prepare to circle), but once inside, it's dimly lit and low-key, ideal for a quiet date night or even solo dining. Spice levels are adjustable-and hot means hot-for all the dishes ranging from creamy red pumpkin curry, to ""Thaitanic"" tofu, eggplant, and string beans in a lemongrass-ginger- and Thai basil-sauce.",0,0
1449,Farallon,Seafood,3,"Union Square's lauded seafood respite is an aquatic-themed fantasy at every turn. Dive in and enjoy an extravagant platter of fruits de mer while admiring their thematic, custom-made chandeliers and bar stools in The Jellyfish Lounge. Also known as the Jelly Bar, it's a San Francisco institution unto itself. Then head to the Pool Room (it once served as the pool room of the Elks Club) to dine on the kitchen's coastal cooking amid sparkling mosaics and a vaulted ceiling. A raw first course unearths yellowtail sashimi adorned with garlicky aïoli, finely chopped piquillo peppers, and dollops of basil chantilly. Following that is an entrée of crisp-skinned grilled salmon, accompanied by torn croutons, heirloom tomatoes, red onions, and balsamic vinegar.",0,0
1450,Bourbon Steak,Steakhouse,4,"For soigné takes on steakhouse classics, it's hard to beat this Michael Mina affiliate in the Westin St. Francis hotel, which draws a steady stream of tourists and business diners for its dressed-up fare. The space is sophisticated and masculine, with dimly lit tables in a tan-and-chocolate color palette and soaring ceilings raised by dark Grecian pillars. As the name implies, meat is a specialty here, and the prime cuts arrive cooked to a perfect medium-rare. Throw in a sweet, crunchy shrimp Louie topped with a fan of creamy avocado, and you'll be on cloud nine. If you can save room for something sweet, make it a point to order the maple-Bourbon panna cotta, a knockout dessert that's garnished with coffee cake and Bourbon ice cream, but of course.",0,0
1451,Luce,Contemporary,3,"Know that the ambience is pleasant, the space is elegant, the service team operates at the highest level, and the food is consistently excellent. Also, know that you probably won't have a hard time getting a reservation-Luce is often inexplicably empty. Let its lack of popularity be your reminder to come here when privacy is desired. Dark and dramatic spherical lights, a wall of wine on display, and cushioned banquettes give the dining room a sumptuous, airy feel that promises the high level of luxury echoed in the cuisine. Luce does serve breakfast, lunch, and brunch; but dinner is when the serious diner arrives for an entirely different experience. Pops of bitter coffee, bright young sage leaves, and dollops of toasted almond foam do not merely enliven an earthy and sweet pear-celery velouté, but prove this kitchen's skill with refined flavor combinations. Autumnal tastes are at the forefront of beautifully roasted lamb loin with cubes of crisped belly, butter-glazed carrots, sweet fuyu persimmons, and toasted buckwheat for nutty crunch. Artistic presentation is paramount in the rectangular tranche of pumpkin cheesecake served on slate drizzled with tangy pomegranate gastrique.",1,1
1452,Izakaya Rintaro,Japanese,2,"Delicate izakaya cuisine with a produce-centric NorCal sensibility awaits at this Japanese newcomer, which transforms even the most humble dishes into art. Freshly made soft tofu is infused with fragrant bergamot peel, while meaty king trumpet mushrooms join classic chicken thighs and tender tsukune on the menu of smoky, caramelized charcoal-grilled skewers. The blancmange, infused with white sesame and topped with sweet black soybeans, is particularly unmissable. Housed in the former Chez Spencer, which was destroyed in a fire, Rintaro has kept its predecessor's gorgeous (and charred) arched ceiling beams, but added a delicate, wood-framed bar and booths. The result is a serene environment perfect for sharing and sampling the exquisite food.",0,0
1453,aliment,American,2,"Named for the Latin term for nourishment, this chic and comforting retreat feeds the soul as well as the body. Cheery, upbeat service, a small but compelling wine list, and an eye-catching stainless steel and wood design make it a pleasant retreat from the heart of Union Square, located just blocks away. The menu may be short but is at once comforting and saturated with flavor-packed, hearty options like a thick and succulent grilled pork chop with pink peppercorn, set over roasted fingerling potatoes and apple chutney; or seared diver scallops in green curry cream topped with crunchy quinoa. For dessert, the homemade custardy cheesecake served on a delicately browned cookie-crumb base and coupled with chopped yuzu jelly and peel, is obligatory.",0,0
1454,SPQR,Italian,3,"Pleasant and homey with excellent Italian cooking, there is little wonder why this destination is always bustling. Book in advance and assume that the dining counter reserved for walk-ins is already overflowing for the night. The space itself is narrow with tightly packed wood tables and furnishings; it would seem cramped were it not for the soaring ceiling, skylights, and open kitchen to brighten the mood. This is a place where passion and enthusiasm for Italian specialties are palpable-even contagious. From piccolo (snacks) to dolce, the extensive menu evolves with the seasons, yet remains consistently good. Memorable pastas may include forest mushroom-stuffed francobolli ravioli tossed with more mushrooms and dark Umbrian lentils beneath a melting layer of espresso BellaVitano. Follow this with a tasting of goat, perhaps including fennel-infused sausage, roasted rib chops, and an exceptional roulade of smoked belly meat served with jammy-sweet quince saba, caramelized cippolini, bok choy, and quince mostarda. Desserts may seem unassuming but are beautifully composed, like the persimmon torta with torched marshmallow, walnut-praline powder, and caramel ice cream.",1,1
1455,1760,Contemporary,3,"The Acquerello team further enriches Nob Hill's dining-scape with the arrival of this darling and rousing adjunct to their upscale destination a block away. Awash in shades of grey, the dusky space closely seats a hip crowd, rife with bonhomie. Creative plates that progress from lightest to heartiest start off with bracing tastes of hamachi crudo seasoned with diced Satsuma, sriracha meringues, and bulgogi vinaigrette. The unorthodox rendition of steak tartare is composed of zesty Thai-spiced dressing and a swipe of buttery Marcona almond purée. The carte goes on to reveal maccheroni tossed with a bright serrrano chili pesto and sweet Dungeness crab. The fried duck sandwich graced by slaw and pickles has become a house specialty.",0,0
1456,Florio,Italian,2,"After a day of shopping in the neighboring boutiques, locals head to Florio to nurse a glass of wine at the bar or to meet friends for a casual dinner. Complete with linen-topped tables, wood floors, and relaxed furnishings, it has the cozy, romantic vibe of an authentic bistro, and you're likely to see plenty of couples (sometimes in duos) out for a date night. The approachable French-cum-Italian menu is full of hearty crowd-pleasers, like a salad of shaved summer squash with mint, pea tendrils, and dollops of creamy ricotta; or a juicy, deep-brown roast chicken laid over caramelized onions and blistered mild peppers. For a delicate finish, try the buttery almond tea cake, accompanied by sweet corn ice cream and tart blackberry verjus.",0,0
1457,Sons & Daughters,Contemporary,4,"Everyone at this inviting corner space is warmly professional, including the eager, well-paced staff. Add in the architecturally detailed dining room-a hybrid between your grandmother's home and a minimalist art gallery with its black-and-cream palette, leather banquettes, and vintage chandeliers-and you'll be counting down the days until your next visit. Small but mighty, the kitchen turns out a seasonal, seven-course fixed menu that consistently pleases. A meal here might begin with candied limequat rind, briny sea beans, and light uni foam to flavor slices of sweet, silky scallops. Savory granola served with roasted cauliflower and creamy sweetbreads unites with trumpet mushrooms to form a perfect textural counterpoint to the smooth cauliflower soup poured tableside. And pork done three ways presents the loin dusted in pastrami spices; an exquisitely tender belly; and block of fried pork jowl set against pickled fennel and Satsuma segments. Meyer lemon curd, sweet and tart with cranberry sauce, is a sublime dessert-but it's the intensely rich chocolate ganache, set over a bay leaf and chocolate cake crowned by pistachios, that showcases the technical prowess of this gifted kitchen.",1,1
1458,Keiko à Nob Hill,Fusion,4,"Luxurious, discrete, and intimate, Keiko blends her own unique culinary style with traditional appeal. Cushioned banquettes wrap the square dining room, outfitted with subdued lighting, mustard-colored fabric walls, and heavy brown trim. Just be prompt: the formal service team handles each night's single seating with military-like precision, and all guests are served at once. Arriving late means holding up the whole dining room (and making enemies). This place takes its service, its mission, and itself very seriously. In the kitchen, Chef Keiko Takahashi performs her own superb feat of balancing impeccable Japanese ingredients with classic French technique. Her success is undeniable from the first taste of impeccable sashimi such as cherry-smoked sanma-its pleasant oiliness countered with dried soy, pickles, and a bright dab of cucumber gelée. Hot, flaky, golden-brown puff pastry may encase a morsel of abalone baked in its pearlescent shell. Japanese Wagyu beef is meltingly tender, rich, and a highlight of the meal when served with yuzu-soy foam and grated wasabi. Very good desserts may feature a Mont Blanc-like parfait layering candied chestnut purée and sweet whipped cream.",1,1
1459,All Spice,International,3,"This baby boy of the elder statesman is gaining a cult-like following and for fitting reason. A friendly welcome awaits after you pass through the elevated lounge, and then descend a few steps to arrive at the spacious, stylish, and urbane All Spice. Covered in a warm palette of browns and sky-blue, and accoutered with pulled back curtains, this sultry lair feels like a hidden escape away from the buzz of Nob Hill. Elegantly set linen-topped tables framed by colonial-style chairs are the perfect platform for Chef Sachin Chopra's globally inspired food. Brought to you at the hands of a professional and intent service team, courses are presented with careful explanations. Each element in the seared Maine scallops buried beneath a potato purée, lobster-citrus emulsion, and garnished with pearls of trout roe, is not just delicious but notable in its complex assortment of flavors. Then texture and global influences take the lead in supremely tender, perfectly seared medallions of lamb topped with anchovy-parsley butter and tailed by thinly sliced fingerling potatoes studded with spicy kimchi. Need to turn down the heat? Cocoa-nib tortellini filled with lemon leaf-ricotta mousse and crowned by fresh coconut offer a cool finis to the festivities.",1,1
1460,Campton Place,Indian,4,"With its sleek booths, wall-to-wall windows, plush carpeting, and pristinely robed tables, this elegant oasis in the Taj Hotel is as formal and traditional as one would expect; even the dining room's pièce de résistance, a blown-glass floral chandelier that hangs from the coffered ceiling, is elegant and sophisticated An odd mix of gourmands and hotel guests keep the vibe desultory inside, but by greeting each diner as they enter, the staff maintains a sense of refinery that is true to this contemporary Cal-Indian menu. Courses, which arrive on charcoal-glazed ceramics, allude to Indian spices but honor outstanding skill and taste over drama or novelty. Lighter dishes cover all bases of flavor and texture as witnessed in a modern expression of chaat (carrots, peas, and tamarind tossed in ""whey shorva"" dotted with chutney); or spicy, pan-fried potato-corn tikkis lodged atop a bright salad of plum brunoise and cilantro. Dollops of tangy lime curd expertly complete this sublime, seasonal plate, while charred potatoes and leeks accentuate a decadent butter-poached Maine lobster. Just as slow-cooked meat dishes have an elegant undertone of garam masala, for dessert, tandoori strawberries with lemon ice cream may under-promise on paper but will over-deliver on taste and flavor.",2,1
1461,Zero Zero,Pizza,2,"Zero Zero may be named for the superlative flour used in its enticingly blistered, thin-crust pies, but this is much more than a pizzeria. While pies like the Geary with chewy clams, caramelized bacon, and Calabrian chilies, are delicious, this casual spot offers much more than a good slice. Absolute knockouts include tomato-braised chickpea bruschetta, oozing with melted burrata; and a salad of smoky grilled radicchio hearts cut by creamy Pt. Reyes blue cheese. A mix of families, hipsters, and business people fresh from the Moscone Center fill the warm, bi-level space. Group dining is ideal for sharing and sampling more of the menu, and the sizable bar will ensure that everyone's equipped with a terrific cocktail or pint of local draft root beer.",0,0
1462,Nopa,Californian,2,"Before you're able to enjoy a single forkful at this Bay Area sensation, you'll have to secure a table-and that takes some serious effort. Reservations are snapped up at lightning speed, and hopeful walk-ins must lineup prior to the start of service to add their name to the list. The good news? Your efforts will be well rewarded. Inside, an open kitchen, soaring ceilings, and hordes of ravenous sophisticates produce a cacophonous setting in which to relish Nopa's wonderful, organic, wood-fired cuisine. Dig into a bruschetta of grilled levain spread with smashed avocado, pickled jalapeños, lemon-dressed arugula, and shaved mezzo secco, or go for the roasted King salmon fillet over creamed corn, smoky maitakes, crisp green beans, and sweet tomato confit.",0,0
1463,4505 Burgers & BBQ,Barbecue,1,"With lines out the door and the scent of wood smoke heavy in the air, one thing is clear: this Civic Center barbecue spot is smokin' hot. And with no service or ambience to speak of (diners order at the counter, claim a spot at one of the picnic tables arranged in the parking lot, and then dig in), the focus is firmly on the food. Chef and butcher Ryan Farr offers succulent bites by the plate or pound. Select a trio and revel in a meaty heap of pork ribs, super moist pulled chicken, and the Bay Area's best brisket accompanied by a Parker House roll, pickles, and sliced onion. Sides like the frankaroni (a mac and cheese fritter studded with hot dog) are average, but follow the crowd and pair your platter with 4505's ""best damn grass-fed cheeseburger.""",0,0
1464,Belcampo,American,2,"If dining in a butcher shop doesn't sound appealing, you haven't yet been to Belcampo. The space is downright elegant-all blue banquettes, rich paneled wood, and wide picture windows. Then imagine the local, organically raised meat, available to-go from a friendly butcher or cooked to perfection on your plate, which is bar none. You'll taste the difference in the juicy, hand-chopped cheeseburger, swathed in melting cheddar and caramelized onions, and the tender smoked guinea hen with chimichurri. Herbivores will be pleased to know that meat isn't the only focus here (an escarole-arugula salad gets bite from an almond-anchovy vinaigrette), and even the wine list is thoughtful. For dessert, try an alfajor, crumbly cookies sandwiching dreamy dulce de leche.",0,0
1465,Bar Crudo,Seafood,2,"Seafood, and plenty of it, is the specialty at this Divisadero hot spot. As the name suggests, their crudo is supreme: whether it's Arctic char with horseradish crème fraîche, wasabi tobiko, and dill; or perhaps raw scallop with sweet corn purée, tarragon oil, and popped sorghum, the combinations are fresh and delicious. Platters of shellfish are available, and there are a few hot dishes like head-on Louisiana prawns in a lobster broth, served beside a baby fennel-pea shoot salad. This small and popular restaurant is often standing-room-only, with only a handful of tables; most guests pack in at or around the bar. Grab a glass of wine or a beer, peek into the open kitchen, and be sure to check out the futuristic mermaid art on the walls.",0,0
1466,Maruya,Japanese,4,"A new team has brought a more easygoing vibe to this sushi restaurant. Housed in a petite space that used to be quiet enough to hear a pin drop, the sushi chefs now joke with customers; for the best service, be sure to request a seat at the central L-shaped counter. The traditional, minimalistic room, decorated with delicate wood, keeps the focus on the fish. Maruya's increased flexibility extends to the menu as well, where traditional dishes like warm, house-made chawan mushi-style tofu or blanched asparagus gets punch from the addition of black truffle and blue cheese sauce, respectively. But in the end, it's all about the nigiri: warm, well-seasoned rice is a cushion for palate-pleasers like custardy uni, luxurious king salmon, and fatty tuna.",0,0
1467,Hakkasan,Chinese,4,"An eclectic crowd of business people, cocktailing hipsters, and fashionable Chinese tourists descend on the SF outpost of this upscale international chain. Housed on the second floor of the historic One Kearny building, the dining room's luxe design features carved wood screens, embroidered white leather, and a striking, V-shaped bar-it's a scene worth dressing up for. Sample Hakkasan's mouthwatering Cantonese eats, however, and you'll see that its appeal transcends the décor. The menu's extensive array of artfully plated treats includes hits like braised chicken dressed with soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, ginger, and scallions. The French green beans, stir-fried with minced pork, dried shrimp, and an umami-packed brown sauce, are just as magical.",0,0
1468,Pancho Villa Taqueria,Mexican,1,"Around the corner from the 16th and Mission BART stop, this long-running taqueria earns high marks from locals. Upon entering, take a moment to step back and examine the menu board; the vested attendants working the flat-tops and grills will be quizzing you on the beans, condiments, and choice of ten meats you desire. That line moves quickly, so be ready. After loading up your burrito, perhaps filled with thinly sliced steak and butterflied prawns, select an agua fresca from the glass barrels, and hit the salsa bar. It features award-winning varieties in every range of heat and sweet to complement their thin, ultra-crispy tortilla chips. Ambience is nil and tables can be hard to snag, but the reward is a fresh and flavorful taste of the Mission.",0,0
1469,Seven Hills,Italian,2,"The dense sidewalk foliage, closely packed tables, and attentive service at this Russian Hill neighborhood hangout will transport you to Italy-that is, until you see the cable car rumbling its way up Hyde, and remember you're in San Francisco. The happy crowd of regulars wouldn't have it any other way. They come to share bowls of house-made pasta, like a tagliolini mingled with asparagus and creamy buffalo ricotta (made fresh on-site). A thick grilled pork chop with gigante beans and charred Calçot onions sates heartier cravings, as do a few offal-centric dishes like rabbit tongues and roasted bone marrow. Finish with a creamy vanilla-blood orange panna cotta, or order a more superlative ricotta for dessert-this time drizzled with honey.",0,0
1470,Chino,Asian,1,"Pan-Asian dining comes to this hip district thanks to the team behind Tacolicious. Loud music fills this fun corner, along with colorful pops of avocado-green tile, turquoise booths, and pastel paper lanterns. After ordering, a caddy of house-made chili garlic and spicy mustard sauces is brought to the table, so be prepared to dip, slather, and spice your own way to bliss once the scrumptious plates arrive. Yuba is presented as a salad of slender strips tossed with pickled shiitakes and cilantro-ginger spiked salsa verde. Skewers of lamb are served hot off the grill, appetizingly charred and seasoned with a hit of chili and cumin. Tasty bao de chicharrón arrive stuffed with crispy pork belly, avocado, pickled onion, cilantro, and spicy aïoli.",0,0
1471,Parallel 37,Californian,3,"Housed in the stately, swanky San Francisco Ritz-Carlton, this modern Californian restaurant has the most laid-back vibe on the property, with a hopping front bar and a casual-chic dining room boasting leather banquettes in tasteful shades of brown and orange. But as relaxing as the atmosphere may be, you'll want to make like your fellow diners-a well-to-do crowd of couples and hotel guests-and dress up for date night. With engaging offerings like roasted morel mushrooms over buttery marble potato purée and silky Alaskan halibut with broccoli pesto and clams, Parallel 37's cuisine is as refined as its haute address suggests. And if you leave without sampling the creamy, nutty black sesame panna cotta with strawberries, well, you're missing out.",0,0
1472,Gajalee,Indian,2,"Don't let the neon signs out front color your opinion of Gajalee, whose dining room is a bright, cheery vision of yellow walls and colorful murals. Snag a window seat for great people-watching on one of Valencia Street's most bustling corners, and settle in for a South Indian feast. Though the creations at this temple of seafood-centric cuisine may not appear lavish, they're heavy on traditional flavor and ingredients (think creamy, coconut-enriched curries and delicate spices). Portions are generous, as in the fish Malvani, a brick-red, roasted coconut-based sauce infused with a mélange of spices, or the Varan dhal, a spice-speckled, lushly textured lentil stew. For a light dessert, the meltingly sweet gulab jamun is just the ticket.",0,0
1473,Yuzuki,Japanese,2,"Formerly an izakaya, this elegant Japanese restaurant has changed chefs and focus, offering delicate Washoku-style fare (read: no sushi). A meal might begin with thin slices of lightly torched mackerel, artfully arranged on shiso leaves; then transition to tender Wagyu beef tataki, airy shredded vegetable and shrimp tempura, and a delicate sundae of azuki beans, mocha, and kelp gelée over vanilla ice cream. With Tartine Bakery and other great gourmet spots sharing its block, there's no denying the fact that Yuzuki has a lot of competition. But with such an exquisite array of plates, not to mention outstanding organic sake and nutty buckwheat tea for sipping, it will transport you to Japan-provided you can snag a tough-to-get reservation.",0,0
1474,Aatxe,Spanish,2,"The name is pronounced ""ahh-chay"" and the food is pronounced ""delicious"" at this Spanish charmer, where pintxos like boquerones with green olive, smoked salmon deviled eggs, and chanterelle croquetas taste straight out of San Sebastián. Keep it classic with shrimp al ajillo, bathed in sizzling garlic-chili oil, or try the adventurous ""Spanish fried rice,"" a take on paella packed with smoky chorizo, tender cuttlefish, and nuggets of tortilla Española. Set in the historic Swedish-American Hall, the small, modern art-packed space has an open kitchen and a thumping, clubby vibe-it's not the place for quiet conversation. But thanks to the well-curated menu of gin and tonics (a Spanish favorite), it's ideal for letting loose and having fun.",0,0
1475,Lord Stanley,Californian,3,"You'll feast like a very refined lord at this outstanding newcomer, which, like its husband-and-wife chef/owners, is half Californian, half European. The West Coast vibe comes from the outstanding local ingredients and airy, light-flooded contemporary space, while across-the-pond touches (both chefs trained in the UK) include tip-free dining with all-inclusive dish prices and an intriguing wine list offering unusual Eastern European vintages. Like its space, Lord Stanley's food is approachably refined, with stunning creations like a summer squash tart with almonds, summer squash, and herb aïoli. Silky black cod, pan-seared in butter and served in a spicy fava bean- and avocado-studded broth, is a showstopper. Even a seemingly simple dessert of grilled peaches with white Lillet sorbet and fruity olive oil gets an intriguing touch from slivers of Castelvetrano olives that add just the right amount of vibrancy. In keeping with its San Franciscan ethos, Lord Stanley is a laid-back spot: the crowd of yupster couples often arrives on foot to the central Polk Street location, attired in casualwear. Be sure to quiz the attentive staff on the dishes-they'll happily explain each intricate layer.",1,1
1476,Bar Tartine,Eastern European,2,"A little bit Eastern European, a little bit Californian, and a whole lot of delicious, this is a favorite among local gourmets. Now chef-owned and with an impending name change, the intensely satisfying menu continues to sate with everything from falafel-like sprouted lentil fritters with kefir and beet sauce, to roasted carrots with sumac yogurt and sunflower tahini. Wood-smoked, flash-fried potatoes, served with earthy black garlic aïoli and an herb salad, are unmissable. The hearty, homey vibe extends to the rustic dining room, with well-worn floors and simple wood furnishings, as well as the gracious staff, who makes diners feel right at home. Be sure to sample the tasting menu, which shows promise of great things to come, along with a house-made soda, tea, or creative cocktail.",0,0
1477,Locanda,Italian,2,"This chic Roman-style osteria packs in the hipsters with a lively scene, killer cocktails, and inspired pastas, like radiatore tossed in tomato-lamb ragù with pecorino and hints of fresh mint. None of this is surprising, considering Locanda is from the team behind Mission favorite, Delfina. Classic chicken under a brick is characteristically on-point: smoky, tender, and served with a squeeze of lemon over nutty farro, Umbrian lentils, and red quinoa salad. Reservations here are a tough ticket, but the attire and vibe are casual and welcoming (if noisy). Can't get a table? Seats at the bar, where the full menu is served, are a solid backup. Locanda's ultra-central address makes parking a challenge, so plan on using the valet or allotting extra time.",0,0
1478,Akiko's,Japanese,3,"Akiko's is hard to find. In addition to sharing a name with a lesser nearby sushi bar, it's hidden just off an alleyway and has no sign. The cool clientele is probably happy to avoid any more competition for the mere handful of tables and seats at the small sushi bar. Arrive at dinner, sit at the counter, toss aside that à la carte menu, and opt for an omakase feast created by the very talented chefs. Expect them to take liberties and leave tradition behind; yet the quality remains high with pristine nigiri featuring fluke, scallop, or geoduck clam minimally garnished and perched atop rice with a touch of nutty red rice vinegar. Bookend the meal with rich tuna poke with sesame, or a lightly torched slice of A5 Wagyu beef with black truffle shavings.",0,0
1479,Nopalito,Mexican,1,"Whether they're digging into a griddled corn panucho stuffed with earthy black beans and zesty citrus-marinated chicken or tender mole enchiladas garnished with tangy queso fresco, local couples and families adore this sustainable Mexican spot. Sister to Cal-cuisine icon Nopa, Nopalito is so beloved that an equally good and popular Inner Sunset location is thriving. The small, cheerful space with reclaimed wood and bright green accents doesn't take reservations; call ahead to get on the list, or try takeout. Once seated, friendly servers will guide the way with house-made horchata for the kids and an extensive tequila selection for grown-ups. Both groups will certainly agree on a sweet finish: Mexican chocolate and seasonal fruit paletas are a favorite.",0,0
1480,Gaspar,French,2,"In a sea of faux-rustic restaurant décor, this recruit stands out for its sexy, intimate vibe, complete with dark-tufted banquettes, soft lighting, and an intimate downstairs bar. It's the kind of place where you'll see FiDi brokers rehash deals over pre-dinner cocktails, before being joined by their well-dressed dates for a swanky dinner party upstairs. The menu of French brasserie favorites is prepared with skill, from grand plateaux of fruits de mer to a perfectly cooked flatiron steak with well-seasoned pommes frites and red wine bordelaise. Don't miss the outstanding Paris-Brest, golden-hued pastry filled with creamy rose-mascarpone and juicy raspberries. Or if you'd rather skip sweets, opt for their well-curated cheese plate.",0,0
1481,Omakase,Japanese,4,"An ""omakase"" places the guests in the hands of the chef-and indeed the only dining option at this tiny new Edomae-style restaurant are three chef-designed tasting menus, clocking in at $100, $150, or $200. Sound risky? It isn't: trust us, this is an experience worth relinquishing all control for. Housed in an area of SoMa popping with big tech companies and modern lofts, Omakase is a quiet little oasis of elegant minimalism. The tiny dining room consists of an L-shaped counter offering 14 seats (so yes, you'll definitely want to make reservations) facing the chefs. But, while all eyes are focused on the food, you won't get the impression these chefs think they're rock stars. On the contrary, it's not uncommon for them to inquire if the size of the sushi rice is appropriate for each guest's mouth; and the chefs and servers both bow profusely and offer their gratitude upon exit. A night in their capable hands will reveal plate after plate of fresh sushi and sashimi (flown in three times a week from the Tsukiji fish market) and unique little dishes like a seaweed and fresh herb salad, laced with lovely strands of Okinawan sea grapes, served over cured whitefish and accompanied by white tuna temarizushi.",1,1
1482,L'Ardoise,French,2,"Local couples do date night in high Parisian style at this long-running Duboce Triangle bistro, where a largely French staff serves up classics like coq au vin and steak frites. The seafood cassolette brings together plump prawns, huge mussels, and flaky fish over a bed of mashed potatoes, then swaths them in a velvety lobster bisque reduction. A floating island of caramelized meringue is especially indulgent, when served in a pool of crème anglaise with strawberries and caramel sauce. Set on a charming, tree-lined block, L'Ardoise's secret weapon is its softly lit back area, whose rich burgundy walls draw in diners. Given their compact space and subdued ambience, save this one for a tête-à-tête, not a big group.",0,0
1483,Saison,Californian,4,"No expense has ever been spared in this massive wow-inducing space. There are enough shining copper pots to supply a village of restaurants in France; wood tables, smart chairs, and faux-fur rugs mean that someone has recently been to Scandinavia. There is also a refreshing breakdown of traditional barriers between the kitchen and dining areas-underscored by the chefs' visits to each table, personally presenting and describing dishes. Dining here is gorgeous; some find the service personalities to be pompous, while others regard them as warm and convivial. However, the blaring 80's soundtrack (if indeed that is your era) keeps the mood lively. One thing that is undeniable is the level of extraordinary skill and detail that Chef Joshua Skenes uses to craft each item on his spontaneous menu. Expect cultured butters and cream, light and infused broths, as well as the smoke of a wood-fired oven to feature prominently. Meals may highlight luscious white sturgeon caviar with crisp potatoes tourné and a dab of cultured cream. Then, sample sweet, tender lobster barely warmed over coals with a savory seaweed dressing and rich lobster-brain sauce. Dry-aged duck is grilled ""near the fire,"" served with giblet-confit ragù, wood-roasted date, a dark jus, and is absolutely delicious.",3,1
1484,Pesce,Italian,2,"Like any good SF renter, when Pesce saw an opportunity for more space, it made the move and uprooted from Polk Street to the Castro. Its commodious new home is minimalist yet warm, with wood tables, bistro chairs, and a pressed-tin ceiling. But some things stay the same, namely, the Venetian-inspired, seafood-heavy cuisine and wonderfully warm service for which it's known. As the Market Street crowds pass by, groups of friends sip wine and share small plates like fritto misto; or caramelized potato gnocchi with shreds of milk-braised pork, sage, and crispy pancetta. The silky hamachi crudo is a must-order, accented with citrus-infused olive oil and a tangle of micro greens. Creamy, none-too-sweet panna cotta is a comforting conclusion.",0,0
1485,Mourad,Moroccan,3,"With the debut of this glamorous outpost at the base of the PacBell building, Aziza Chef/owner Mourad Lahlou has become a big-city slicker. The area's young, food-obsessed techies practically flock to this grand space, replete with soaring ceilings, glowing central columns, and a glass-enclosed wine cellar catwalk. Chef Lahlou's food retains the influence of his Moroccan upbringing, with dishes like duck confit basteeya rolled in thin sheets of flaky pastry. However, diners can also look forward to new levels of creativity using ingredients from around the globe. Even a simple dish of carrots gets unexpected heft from meaty dates and crunchy pecans, not to mention a hit of spice from urfa pepper. Then a wreath of eggplant packs a punch of texture and flavor into one beautiful dish; while tender, smoky octopus, served in a spicy lamb merguez broth with chickpea purée, is Californian and Moroccan all at once. The visionary chef's attention to detail extends to the exceptional drinks. But, those travelling in groups may also want to consider the larger La'Acha menu, which offers family-style Moroccan dishes. Imagine roast chicken or lamb shoulder, rife with sides and sauces, and you'll get the picture.",1,1
1486,Trou Normand,Mediterranean,2,"Named for the Norman tradition of drinking a glass of Calvados to revive the palate during a heavy meal, Bar Agricole's SoMa sequel shares its predecessor's skill with outstanding cocktails. They're perfect palate-cleansers for the expansive and delightful house charcuterie like rich duck pâté with plum and Armagnac or garlicky finocchiona kissed with fennel seeds. While their salumi and selection of spirits are huge draws, Trou Normand is an all-day menu of shareable French- and Italian-leaning plates. Come for a croque madame with ramps and locally roasted coffee at brunch, sausage sandwiches with homemade sauerkraut at lunch, and pastas or roasted meats at dinner. This large and glamorous space is a major hit among hipster tech types.",0,0
1487,Gioia,Pizza,2,"With its large space and casual vibe, Gioia has become a Russian Hill standby, drawing families with kids, groups of friends, and even solo diners (there's lots of counter seating). The rustic décor features white subway-tile walls, an open kitchen, and wood and metal furniture. Be warned: the noise level can be a bit high for any intimate conversation. The highlight here is pizza, with creatively topped pies like summer squash with pesto, burrata, and Calabrian chili, or sausage, broccoli, leeks, pecorino, and olives. They're pricey, but worth it. A selection of salads and antipasti make for great starters. Otherwise, opt for rigatoncini in a meaty pork ragù with fresh, creamy ricotta and more Calabrian chili. A second location dwells in Berkeley.",0,0
1488,Mason Pacific,American,2,"Since its debut in 2013, this smart American bistro is the darling of Nob Hill with swarms of Teslas and Maseratis lining up at the valet station. The stylish occupants, from tech millionaires to white-haired society matrons, stream into the light-filled dining room where they angle for a seat at the semi-private banquette facing the street or in the front room at the marble bar. The menu is prepared with skill and top-notch ingredients, and includes a note-perfect fried chicken and caramelized Alaskan halibut with grated cauliflower and peperoncini. The burger, served on a pretzel bun with smoked tomato, is also a terrific choice. And while the friendly, smartly attired staff keeps the handful of tables moving, reservations are still a must.",0,0
1489,Benu,Contemporary,4,"Don't miss the street views directly into this kitchen as you enter-the chefs here are preparing a series of masterpieces. Outside in the courtyard, benches are exactly the kind of place to linger, after a regal repast. The interior is awash in earthy colors, sleek banquettes, and oversized cushions. The slate-gray dining room is serene with clean lines drawing the eye across the meticulous design, while the staff is impressively warm and relaxed for a restaurant of this caliber. Chef Corey Lee's nightly tasting menu is a unique marriage of contemporary American and Korean influences and Master Sommelier Yoon Ha oversees an exceptional beverage program. Dishes promise a fascinating interplay of ingredients, as seen in the potato salad crowned with mirin-glazed anchovies and spirals of mild red chili. Find subtlety and elegance in raw fluke seasoned with sesame oil and sandwiched between crisp sesame leaves; while sea bream served in an aged tangerine jus with black trumpet mushrooms is royally decadent. Rich, marbled beef reaches a new height of excellence when prepared with charred scallion sauce, ramps, and meaty morels. Finally, a striking dessert of luscious coconut cream with strawberry gelée, tapioca pearls, and topped with a thin disc of meringue, will have you seeing stars.",3,1
1490,Janchi,Korean,2,"Koreans know their drinking snacks, and this Seoul-inspired ""gastropub"" boasts some great ones, including KFC (the K is for ""Korean""-no colonels involved) coated in peppery, crunchy, garlicky breading and gleaming with an optional sweet and spicy chili glaze. Or try the fried pancakes, loaded with kimchi and onion. On the lighter side, there's a great salad with large cubes of tofu and crisp greens topped with tangy vinaigrette and dollops of chili sauce. With this booze-friendly menu, great drinks are paramount, and Janchi's list brims with Korean beers, soju, sake, and cocktails to prime your palate for the next bite. The simple space outfitted with dark wood furnishings and red accents is no-frills, but for an easygoing night out it's just right.",0,0
1491,Per Diem,American,2,"This aptly-named hot spot is a favorite among the well-heeled FiDi power players who fill its dramatic, bi-level space. Equal parts industrial loft and swanky Prohibition-era club, Per Diem is a vision of rich wood surfaces, dramatic pillars, exposed brick, and concrete. It's a sleek atmosphere for a sleek crowd-but the real draw here is the food. A new chef has taken the menu in a seasonally inspired direction that's at once refined and approachable. Of-the-moment delights include a salty, smoky flatbread topped with slices of roasted porcini and hon shimeji mushrooms, shaved prosciutto, and crescenza cheese. This may be tailed by an equally impressive spinach-ricotta ravioli with roasted squash, a soft-poached egg, and sprinkle of lemon gremolata.",0,0
1492,Stones Throw,Contemporary,2,"A good neighborhood restaurant should only be a stone's throw away, and this model has clearly hopscotched into Russian Hill's affections. Its terra-cotta floors, yellow walls, and chunky wood tables have a Mediterranean air, but the menu is more eclectically American, with a sizable beer and wine selection that makes the front bar great for a spur-of-the-moment drink and bite. Clever takes on approachable dishes abound on the menu, from ""toad in the hole"" lasagna with a poached egg at dinner, to asparagus and duck confit hash at brunch. The creamy smoked salmon mousse, with bagel chips and crème fraîche, is rich and delicious. And pillowy doughnuts, topped with PB&J at dinner or pumpkin spice and pumpkin butter at brunch, are a delightful surprise.",0,0
1493,Reverb,Californian,2,"The former home of Verbena has undergone a quiet revamp from the same owners, shifting from vegetable-centric haute cuisine to a more relaxed, omnivorous offering. Highlights include tender, smoky grilled octopus with spicy romesco and salsa verde; a delectable trio of heirloom carrots (caramelized, shaved, and pickled); and moist, flaky white bass with roasted artichoke purée, artichoke chips, and briny olive tapenade. While Reverb's menu has shifted, its hip space was left mostly untouched, with dramatic antique wood doors, soaring ceilings, and a glowing tower of back-lit jars of homemade pickles. The bustling bar, which serves up punchy concoctions like the Tikal (with mezcal, pineapple, celery, and dry sherry), remains a neighborhood favorite.",0,0
1494,Helmand Palace,Afghan,2,"A drab exterior and an awkward Van Ness address haven't always worked in Helmand Palace's favor, but the food-savvy know it's one of the Bay Area's best for Afghan cuisine. The well-appointed interior is worlds away from the busy thoroughfare's steady stream of traffic, with linen-draped tables, big blue-cushioned armchairs, and warm, inviting service. Every meal here kicks off with a basket of fluffy flatbread, served with three irresistible dipping sauces. The kaddo, caramelized baby pumpkin and ground beef in a garlic-yogurt sauce, is a perennial favorite, as is the chapendaz, marinated beef tenderloin over a tomato-pepper purée, rice, and lentils. Vegetarians will find numerous dishes to enjoy, all of them just as flavorful as the carnivorous feast.",0,0
1495,Cockscomb,American,3,"Carnivores will thrill to the offerings at this newcomer from offal-loving Top Chef Masters champ Chris Cosentino. And, largely because it doesn't shy away from aggressively rich fare like wood-grilled bruschetta topped with uni butter, sweet Dungeness crab, and buttery lardo; or smoky butterflied roast quail in a rich, salty tetrazzini gravy. Even veggie-centric celery Victor gets a meaty spin, its tangy vinaigrette accented by crisp chicken-skin chicharrónes. Thanks to the hearty menu and location in a tech-centric corridor, Cockscomb draws a mostly male crowd that packs in for shellfish platters and intense, boozy cocktails named for SF landmarks. Laid-back, yet attentive service and a soaring, industrial space make it the very picture of a hot spot.",0,0
1496,La Folie,French,4,"Few grandes dames of high-end French cuisine remain in the city, but this long-running spot from Chef/owner Roland Passot has held strong. With two formal dining rooms featuring starched tablecloths, polished servers, and a tall art deco wine case, it's a favorite among occasion-celebrating couples and the luxury-loving tourist crowd. Diners can build their own three-to-five course prix-fixe, with old-school dishes like perfectly seared lamb rack with fava beans and green garlic, or delicate Dungeness crab bisque with English peas. Sumptuous supplements, from foie gras to lobster, are also offered, as is a chef's-choice tasting menu. For dessert, a clever baked Alaska blends bay leaf and rhubarb ice creams with vanilla chiffon.",0,0
1497,Oriental Pearl,Chinese,1,"Escape the cacophony of Chinatown at this calm upstairs retreat, where red ribbons hang in the light-filled windows and an attentive staff offers some of the neighborhood's best service. Though the crowd is decidedly non-Chinese with more than a few tourists mixed in, the food isn't overly Americanized and covers a range of regional specialties. Commence your culinary tour of China with an order of barbecue spareribs, lacquered on the outside and exceptionally tender on the inside, or a piece or two of dim sum. Then dive into the Chiuchow-style marinated duck, a plateful of sweet-and-salty meat beneath crisp, golden-brown skin. The Singapore-style rice noodles mixed with shrimp, pork, scallion, and yellow curry paste, are equally divine.",0,0
1498,Fringale,French,2,"This tech-centric corner of SoMa has seen booms and busts aplenty since the restaurant's opening in 1991, but Fringale has held strong, with a loyal squad of regulars who come for a taste of its Basque-inflected French cooking. The timeless décor starring clean wood furnishings and soft lighting is ideal for a business lunch or date night. Start with the tasty calamari à la plancha-its topping of briny black olives and sliced jalapeños clearly differentiates Fringale from its tired bistro competition. After the mostly French staff recommends a wine, dive into the juicy roasted chicken breast over fluffy Israeli couscous and crunchy fennel. Finish with a creamy, nutty hazelnut-and-roasted almond mousse cake, drizzled with rich dark chocolate, of course!",0,0
1499,Frascati,Mediterranean,2,"Forget circling for parking and hop on a cable car instead to reach this quaint Mediterranean standby, where you'll see more of the iconic vehicles pass by their large front windows. Inside, closely-spaced tables are ideal for an intimate meal, and local residents definitely know it, because reservations are always hard to come by. Frascati's fare may not be the city's most innovative, but it is very satisfying, thanks to well-made classics like tender potato gnocchi with asparagus and peas in thyme-white truffle butter, or grilled duck breast in pomegranate sauce over hearts of palm and herb spaetzle. Split the luscious pain perdu, caramelized sponge cake soaked in citrusy crème anglaise, and let the friendly servers and soft lighting work their magic.",0,0
1500,Regalito,Mexican,2,"Regalito is Spanish for ""little gift,"" and those who dine here will surely understand the choice of name. Instead of relying on the bold, spicy approach of local taquerias, Regalito takes a milder, ingredient-focused path, infusing dishes like chicken enchiladas with new life via handmade corn tortillas, fresh roast chicken, and a delicate green chili sauce. Familiar Mexican favorites get an upgrade here, from the super-sweet, fresh corn on the cob elote with tangy chili-lime mayo and cotija, to that silky vanilla flan bobbing in a pool of caramel sauce. The cheery, colorful space and friendly servers are welcoming, but the real charmers are those smiling cooks, who happily interact with diners in prime seats overlooking the open kitchen.",0,0
1501,Commonwealth,Californian,2,"Welcome to this cool food-cum-tech heaven, appropriately set in the heart of the Mission District. Inside, the dining room nails that Nordic-Cali sensibility with sleek filament light bulbs, bare wood, and frosted glass that allows sun but shields guests from the bustling (read gritty) surrounds. The hospitable team of servers shares that same informal style. And their long counter is the absolute best place to drink, dine, and chill with a few friends. À la carte offerings are a welcome alternative to the fixed menu, and light portions encourage ordering four or more courses. The full tasting though lets guests thoroughly explore the kitchen's adept contemporary cooking. However, this meal may not be for everyone as the chefs' creativity can be more eclectic than crowd-pleasing. Begin with a lush, layered presentation of decadent sea urchin with creamy cauliflower pudding, fennel, and trace of popcorn powder and kale juice. Then remarkably tender pork cheeks are infused with wood smoke and served with Brussels sprout leaves, shaved apple, and crisp daikon in a fermented chili-miso broth. Desserts are far out yet technically superb, as in the salty-sweet boilermaker of beer meringue with sweet chocolate ganache, salty pretzel crumble, and crème fraîche ice cream.",1,1
1502,Starbelly,Californian,2,"The simplest things are often the best, as a meal at Starbelly deliciously proves. Whether you're twirling a forkful of garlicky tomato spaghetti with jalapeños and house-made bacon, or squeezing a lime wedge over exquisite cornmeal-crusted fish tacos with spicy cabbage slaw, you're sure to savor something beautifully made, seasonal, and unfussy. Even an old-school sticky toffee cake is elevated with fresh Medjool dates and tangy mascarpone. A nexus of the Castro social scene, the cheerful, wood-paneled space is always full of locals hopping from table to table to greet their friends, and the back patio (heated and sheltered when it's foggy) is an appealing refuge. Be sure to make reservations: this is a local favorite, and for good reason.",0,0
1503,Fly Trap,Middle Eastern,2,"This contemporary Middle Eastern restaurant is definitely a trap for corporate folk from neighboring offices, who often end up turning ""just one"" delicious after-work cocktail into a meal inside this warm and inviting dining room. Here, old architectural and botanical sketches as well as vintage maps abound; and the staff is attentive, efficient and kind, never fussy or intrusive. The unique food has a strong Persian influence that is showcased in tender meatballs with harissa, pomegranate, and pistachios. But even the more contemporary fare boasts a nuanced blend of spices, like the black cardamom in a braised short rib with quinoa, cranberry beans, and salsa verde. A tangy goat cheesecake with eggplant jam may sound strange, but is utterly satisfying.",0,0
1504,Delfina,Italian,2,"One of the city's greats for rustic Italian meals, Delfina is nestled on a block of gems for food lovers including Bi-Rite (and its creamery), Tartine Bakery, and sister spot Pizzeria Delfina. But even with this rarefied competition, Delfina books up well in advance and draws lines for its few walk-in seats. The simple, yet lively dining room is attended to by a warm staff, and the bill of fare shifts with the seasons. Soul-satisfying dishes include house-made fazzoletti with garlicky basil pesto, tender potatoes, and crisp green beans, as well as a perfectly roasted half-chicken in a richly caramelized jus. For dessert, one spoonful of the creamy, delicate fig-leaf panna cotta, accented by macerated pluots, will have you floating home on a cloud.",0,0
1505,Leopold's,Austrian,2,"The boisterous spirit of an Austrian gasthaus is alive and well in Russian Hill. All thanks are due to Leopold's, which draws a young crowd to its slice-of-Vienna dining room, adorned with wood booths, deer antlers, and attended to by cheerful female servers in dirndls. If dinner alone is your goal, go early; convivial groups lend the space a communal mien, but also get larger and louder as the night wears on and the boots of beer are drained. The carte du jour is rife with well-executed classics like golden-brown pork wiener schnitzel with a cucumber salad, vegetable strudel, and delectable raspberry Linzer torte. If you've got a group in tow, the choucroute garni platter, laden with pork ribs, sausage, potatoes, and sauerkraut, is a crowd-pleaser.",0,0
1506,Salt House,American,2,"With a roster of restaurants including nearby Town Hall and Anchor & Hope, the owners of this Mission Street favorite know exactly what diners want. Attractive and comfortable, the industrial setting embraces its past as a former printing warehouse with details like wide plank and exposed brick flooring. While the atmosphere is business-friendly at lunchtime, with elegant fare like a bruschetta of grilled sourdough bread and decadent burrata drizzled with quality olive oil and syrupy balsamic, it amplifies when the after-work crowd streams in. Mains may include golden-skinned chicken confit atop a mélange of spring vegetables. Of course, such inventive desserts as salted caramel chocolate cake with German chocolate cake ice cream are not to be missed.",0,0
1507,Z & Y,Chinese,2,"Some like it hot, and here they are in heaven. Be forewarned: timid palates should steer clear of the super-spicy Sichuan dishes that have made Z & Y a Chinatown smash hit. Nearly every dish is crowned with chilies, from the huge mound of dried peppers that rest atop tender, garlicky bites of fried chicken to the flaming chili oil anointing tender, flaky fish fillets in a star anise-tinged broth with Sichuan peppercorns aplenty. The well-worn dining room may seem unremarkable and the service perfunctory, but the crowds are undeterred. Plan to wait among eager fans for a seat, but then settle in for delicate pork-and-ginger wontons swimming in spicy peanut sauce and more chili oil. Allot time to navigate the challenging parking situation.",0,0
1508,Frances,Californian,3,"This tiny, intensely personal restaurant from Chef/owner Melissa Perello has been a neighborhood hit from the get-go. Chic, cozy, and perpetually packed, it's as perfect for a low-key date night as it is for dinner with the kids. And while reservations are a nigh-impossible score, the gracious staff saves ten counter seats for walk-ins-and serves every diner with equal aplomb. Perello eschews trendy powders and foams for hearty, seasonal fare, like bacon beignets with maple-chive crème fraîche, vibrant spinach and green garlic soup with black pepper cookies, and pan-seared wild trout with sunchokes and spiced yogurt. An array of exquisite desserts, like buttermilk panna cotta with strawberries, offers a fresh, light conclusion.",0,0
1509,Lazy Bear,Contemporary,4,"Communal dining is the name of the game at this white-hot restaurant. Billed as a fine dining dinner party, Lazy Bear is an underground phenom ""gone legit,"" meaning your average Joe can now score a seat. That is, if they can jump through a few hoops: you'll need to buy a ticket in advance, and once you do, you'll be e-mailed a list of house rules you should read in earnest. Fortunately, this hip hottie delivers. The nightly tasting menu is dished out in a cool, bi-level warehouse and starts with aperitifs served alongside small bites upstairs in the loft, before moving downstairs to a dining room that boasts two giant tree slabs as communal tables, each lined with 20 chairs. Diners are given a pamphlet with the menu (there's space for note-taking underneath) and are invited to walk into the kitchen to chat with the cooks themselves. The young crowd loves this kind of chef worship, and digging into David Barzelay's luscious fare, we're inclined to agree. A saffron dish of creamy Anson Mills grits arrives with fresh lobster, pickled chard, Tokyo turnips, and prawn roe crisps; while tender caramelized squab is paired with lightly roasted sweet pear, a reduced jus, and crushed spices for dipping.",1,1
1510,Wayfare Tavern,Gastropub,2,"Though it feels like it's been around for decades, celebrity chef Tyler Florence's FiDi favorite is actually a toddler-at least in tavern years. Nonetheless, it's become a standby for business types doing deals or enjoying post-work cocktails. Complete with dark wood and leather furnishings, a private billiards room, and bustling bar, Wayfare Tavern has the air of a gastropub-turned-private club. Hearty Americana with seasonal accents defines the menu, like a take on biscuits and gravy that integrates plump dayboat scallops and spicy chili oil. Buttermilk-brined fried chicken, grilled hanger steak, and baked macaroni and cheese are pure comfort, as is a decadent TCHO chocolate cream pie with salty caramel ganache and devil's food cake crumble.",0,0
1511,Belga,Belgian,2,"Belgian brews and bites are the cornerstones of this new recruit in the former Café des Amis, which has kept its brasserie look but pivoted from Paris to Brussels. All the classics are accounted for: well-salted frites with garlic aïoli; bowls of mussels; and of course, house-made sausages-try the combo board, which comes with andouille, boudin noir, boudin blanc, and currywurst, not to mention a generous bowl of spaetzle. Flatbreads and salads round things out. The Euro-café vibe is fun with red banquettes, classic bistro chairs, and marble floors to complement the big beer selection (both European and domestic) and cocktails. Young Marinaites have, understandably, caught on quickly: the bar and dog-friendly patio are constantly abuzz.",0,0
1512,Trestle,American,2,"In SF's dizzyingly expensive dining landscape, this rookie, which offers a three-course menu for $35, is an incredible steal-provided you're willing to sacrifice freedom of choice. Dishes are top-notch, with great ingredients: on a given night, you might sit down to a repast of silky slow-roasted pork belly with grilled peaches, pristine pan-roasted salmon with chickpeas and salsa verde, and a velvety dark chocolate pot de crème with Bourbon-whipped cream. As with any killer deal, there are caveats: reservations are necessary and they are hard to score, and the noise level is through the roof. But, the historic brick space is lots of fun with cool, contemporary art and a namesake central trestle table. The fact that the price is right only adds to the lure.",0,0
1513,Twenty Five Lusk,American,3,"Nestled in the center of SoMa's dynamic startup scene, this high-design stunner draws an equally high-powered crowd. They stream in at happy hour to catch up on the latest tech gossip in the swinging lounge, then head upstairs to wheel and deal in the refined dining room, which boasts an impressive glassed-in exhibition kitchen. Lusk's food is American with contemporary touches, from the togarashi and carrot coulis that spikes a highbrow take on shrimp and grits, to the ginger vinaigrette that accents a summery salad of little gem lettuce and heirloom cucumbers. Dessert aficionados will thrill to the freedom from choice offered by the ""sampling"" trio, featuring creamy lime posset, spiced carrot cake, and a decadent salted-caramel brownie.",0,0
1514,Range,Contemporary,2,"Owner Phil West has returned to cooking at this Mission standby, whose menu has veered away from contemporary flourishes and back into straightforward American comfort. The results are sturdy and satisfying: tender roast chicken practically melts into a lovely asparagus, walnut, and kumquat bread salad, while a luscious chocolate peanut butter mousse cake gets an added boost from rich salted caramel ice cream. The drinks at Range continue to be as notable as the eats, and diners who skip cocktail hour are missing out on smart concoctions like the rum-based Wolf Moon, which boasts spicy, nutty notes from chili liqueur and sherry. Loyal regulars continue to fill the small, contemporary dining room, whose low, wood-beamed ceilings make every meal cozy.",0,0
1515,Doc Ricketts,American,2,"Nestled in a sea of spendy corporate hangouts and touristy Italian-American joints, Doc Ricketts is a welcome change of pace with its unique upstairs-downstairs vibe-the basement level is Doc's Lab, a comedy and music venue where the full menu is offered. The upstairs restaurant is simple and airy, with wood furnishings, wide windows, and engaging servers at the ready. The American fare on the menu is unfussy and skillfully prepared, from butter-sautéed wild mushroom panzanella with chunks of torn sourdough and bacon-shallot vinaigrette, to a juicy, generously portioned half roast chicken, accompanied by toast slathered in chicken-liver mousse. Finish with a luscious chocolate pot de crème, topped with vanilla Chantilly and a chocolate cookie.",0,0
1516,Kusakabe,Japanese,4,"This is a place for dedicated sushi lovers. Serene with warm wood, clean lines, and a strong sense of minimalism, Kusakabe brings distinctive creativity to this sushi-focused operation. The stunning counter is crafted from a single piece of live-edge elm. Oyster-hued leather chairs and a ceiling of wood slats complete the Japan-chic look. Of late, due to increased popularity (and ergo, demand), the nightly omakase tasting has felt more like a conveyor belt-style dining experience. However, by employing myriad cooking techniques, Chef Mitsunori Kusakabe ensures that every bite is deliciously balanced and memorable. After awakening the palate with a cup of warm kelp tea, embark on a sashimi parade starring thick slices of bluefin served over crushed ice and with a tangy yuzu- onion- and sesame oil-sauce. A soup course may feature fresh crabmeat in a delicate tai broth bobbing with mitsuba, tofu, and sweet corn-speckled fish cake. And finally, a top rendition of sushi yields shima aji with daikon as well as ayu that is torched just enough to blister the skin and impeccably contrasted with grated cucumber. A single Shigoku oyster on the half shell served with a simple brushing of yuzu juice makes for a nice opening bite.",1,1
1517,Tosca Café,Italian,3,"This historic bar has been expertly revived under NYC stars, April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman, who spent millions to add a kitchen and make its old-school charm seem untouched. White-coated bartenders shake and stir behind the glorious carved wood bar, while diners feast in the cushy red leather booths. Reservations aren't accepted and tables are few, so expect a wait. The food is Italian-American with Bloomfield's signature meaty influences, like flavorful, gamey grilled lamb ribs that nearly fall off the bone. Pastas are strong, from creamy gemelli cacio e pepe to rich, spicy bucatini all'Amatriciana, but don't neglect their vegetables: a dish of tender cauliflower and potatoes in a rich taleggio sauce with crunchy breadcrumbs is a showstopper.",0,0
1518,Il Casaro,Pizza,2,"In a sea of too-touristy Italian joints, Il Casaro is the rare North Beach spot that delivers the goods: Neapolitan-style pizza cooked to crispy perfection in a bright red wood-fired oven. Whether you opt for the classic Margherita or the zippy diavola (with spicy salami and Calabrian chiles), you're sure to achieve carbohydrate bliss. Throw in an antipasto or salad and a silky panna cotta with raspberry coulis, and you're all set-at an affordable price, to boot. Il Casaro's space is simple but hip, with reclaimed wood, polished concrete floors, and utensils in empty San Marzano tomato cans. Don't expect more than cursory service, as the restaurant is always packed and doesn't take reservations: waits can run an hour or more at peak times.",0,0
1519,Jannah,Middle Eastern,2,"The name of Yahya Salih's lovely Middle Eastern restaurant translates to ""heaven,"" a concept echoed by its blue walls and ceiling, adorned with puffy white cloud paintings and glowing chandeliers. From the large front bar to the back patio, it's an airy and inviting choice for groups or families. Paradise extends to the plate, where seasonal California ingredients are highlighted in Kurdish and Iraqi specialties like grilled, mint-marinated lamb kabobs with outstanding accompaniments including creamy hummus, ultra-fresh tabbouleh, and crisp lavash. But diners veer towards more unique dishes like the perdaplow, a richly flavorful, basteeya-like phyllo pastry enclosing tender shredded chicken, fragrant cardamom, and sweet golden raisins.",0,0
1520,Chiaroscuro,Italian,2,"An upscale retreat for well-heeled FiDi deal-doers, Chiaroscuro brims with a lunchtime crowd tucking into memorable pastas. One such standout is the delicate house-made tagliolini with julienned winter vegetables and a light, truffle-scented sauce enriched with Parmigiano. If you can't choose a single dish, opt for the popular ""trilogia"" of three daily delights, then follow it with pollo ai peperoni, a delicious chicken roulade stuffed with roasted bell pepper and served over crisp vegetables. While its food is classically Roman, Chiaroscuro's décor is modern, sleek, and chic, with pillow-topped concrete banquettes and modern glass-and-metal chandeliers. For a quieter meal, come at dinner, when the crowds dissipate and the menu goes prix-fixe.",0,0
1521,the house,Asian,2,"This perennially popular Asian bistro provides a welcome alternative to the Italian-heavy streets in North Beach. The décor is minimal with blonde wood tables and there are always specials so listen closely to the efficient staff as they recite the bounties of the day. A versatile drinks list completes the enticing spread in addition to offering a happy reprieve to those who've endured a long wait for limited tables. Dishes like delicately prepped scallops in saffron sauce, and crispy halibut tempura propped atop roasted cauliflower may vary by the day. But a playful, fusion element remains a steady feature in all items, including house-specialties, of which warm wasabi noodles topped with flank steak or teriyaki-glazed salmon are perfect examples.",0,0
1522,Michael Mina,Contemporary,4,"Chef Michael Mina's eponymous home base remains the crown jewel in his nationwide empire of restaurants. Housed in a stately grey stone building, it's a magnet for nearby business folk, who can be seen brokering deals over dinner or unwinding with a glass of the chef's private-label cabernet along with a bite from the bar menu. High-ceilinged and lively, the spacious dining room is elegantly appointed with huge foliage arrangements and oversized framed mirrors. The French- and Asian-influenced cuisine emphasizes luxurious ingredients as found in seared abalone, divinely tender and presented with grilled cabbage heart, sticky rice, and a togarashi-spiced red miso broth poured tableside. Lobster is impeccably cooked and plated, bearing a seasonally appropriate mélange of produce and a dousing of savory ginger-lemongrass jus to complete the composition. Mina's menu is constructed as a four-course prix-fixe, but diners are also invited to select the chef's tasting for an extended expression of the kitchen's talents. Regardless of your decision, there will always be dessert-followed by joy-when frozen nougat dressed with Earl Grey streusel and torched white grapefruit segments is set in front of you.",1,1
1523,Farmhouse Kitchen Thai,Thai,2,"For authentic Thai flavors in a lively space, this Mission neophyte is hard to beat-and already has a dedicated following among the young techies and families who reside in the neighboring industrial lofts. Adorned with an accent wall covered in red and gold faucets and planter boxes full of Thai herbs, it's the kind of affordable weeknight spot that's designed for repeat business. The array of classic dishes is prepared with quality ingredients, from the marinated flank steak rolled around crisp cucumber, cilantro and mint to the smoky coconut- and turmeric-marinated barbecue chicken with papaya salad and black sticky rice. A menu must: the herbal rice salad, a multi-dimensional blend of green mango, dried shrimp, chili, long beans, and much more.",0,0
1524,Perbacco,Italian,2,"Slick financial types flex their expense accounts at this longtime Northern Italian favorite, whose polished décor belies an extensive menu of house-made pastas and comfort fare like roast chicken and meatballs at lunch, with slightly more refined takes at dinner. Dishes are executed with care-from mortadella-stuffed, black truffle-topped quail to handmade pastas, though portions can be a little scant. The space is larger inside than it looks, with plenty of booths and seats at the marble bar up front, and buzzy tables in the back with a view of the open-plan kitchen. Well-versed servers will encourage saving room for the end of the meal-as the cheese display, an impressive selection of grappas, and the inventive, delicious desserts are all highlights.",0,0
1525,Rose Pistola,Italian,2,"A new chef has enlivened the menu at this longtime North Beach spot, which stands out from the Disneyland-like crowd of tourist-baiting Italian restaurants along Columbus Avenue. The kitchen can satisfy the pasta-and-wine grind, but it's capable of a lot more. Perfectly tender and crisp-fried calamari gets a punch from an almond salsa verde dip, garlic-sautéed fresh spinach is bright and delicate, and the pan-fried chicken Milanese is a crisp, well-seasoned work of art. Rose Pistola is also a cut above in terms of décor, thanks to huge front windowpanes, subdued mosaic-tile floors, and a large, dark wood bar. Linger over a slice of buttery, cream-filled sacripantina cake, and engage in some great people-watching on the busy thoroughfare outside.",0,0
1526,Pabu,Japanese,3,"Michael Mina and Ken Tominaga have gone big with their Japanese offspring and baby boy is quite a looker. Encompassing a stunning, high-ceilinged bar, gleaming sushi counter, several dining rooms, and a casual ramen joint (The Ramen Bar, next door), Pabu is enormous in space but serene in atmosphere. The warm service is highly personal. If you can fork over the requisite gobs of cash, the massive menu will accommodate seemingly any Japanese craving-from whole grilled squid and izakaya-style skewers of smoky chicken tails or thick trumpet mushrooms, to a sweet, salty, and savory burdock salad. Sushi fans can opt for the omakase or stick to à la carte treats like a tender kanpyo squash roll. The top-notch sake and Japanese whiskey lineup is worth exploring.",0,0
1527,Cotogna,Italian,2,"Though rustic compared to Quince, its high-end sibling, Michael and Lindsay Tusk's casual Italian offshoot would be elegant by any other standard. Stylish, bright, and a hot ticket reservation-wise, the space centers around an exhibition kitchen, from which crisp pizzas and hearty roasted meats emerge. Cotogna's absolutely delicious menu highlights Chef Tusk's pristine pastas, like rolled casconcelli stuffed with velvety pumpkin purée in sage butter, as well as seasonal starters that include a beautiful chicory salad with sweet red apple, pomegranate, and Piave cheese. And there's always that three-course prix-fixe delight: an exceptional value that features a dessert like pitch-perfect butterscotch budino with sea salt and muscovado custard.",0,0
1528,Quince,Italian,4,"Situated on a tree-lined street amid upscale galleries and design firms, Quince is elegant but never bogged down by formalities. Make your way through the champagne lounge to find this high-ceilinged, copper-hued room and its well-versed, passionate service team-clearly one of the best in the city. Solo diners may head to the bar, which is a warm gathering perch that also pours a lineup of standout drinks. Each fixed menu option promises fine-tuned, elevated, and inspired cooking that aims beyond Italy. Pastas are a wow-inducing highlight here. Each handcrafted tortellini is a picture of perfect symmetry, stuffed with delicate pork, coated with cheese fonduta, and topped with slivers of white Alba truffles. Unique meat courses culminate in the distinctive Cinta Senese (heritage pork from Siena) prepared two ways. The first is faggotini bundling pork and wild nettles; the second is a chestnut flower crispello stuffed with a confit of belly and braised shoulder mixed with Swiss chard. Desserts yield a very grand finale with dramatic presentations of Valrhona ""Perigord"" truffles filled with chocolate, citrus, and finished with a chestnut tuille and Satsuma orange.",2,1
1529,RN74,Californian,3,"Named for Burgundy's most famous road, RN74 draws a crowd of suited corporate types who pack this high-ceilinged room for lunch. Come sunset, the lounge is equally busy for after-work drinks, but dinner is sedate. Burgundy is, of course, the house specialty here, and an array of high-end bottles is listed on a train station-style board, which clicks over as each one sells out. The food is playful and globally inspired, from pastrami-style salmon tartare with warm brioche and creamy dill crème fraîche to a panzanella with arugula, cherry tomatoes, and pan-fried chicken breast. Each plate is artistically constructed, like the ""peach mille feuille,"" which combines pretty dollops of vanilla cream and peach sorbet with peaches and shards of puff pastry.",0,0
1530,Tony's Pizza Napoletana,Pizza,2,"A veritable polymath of pizza, Tony Gemignani serves every variety imaginable at his North Beach institution, from wood-fired Neapolitan to gas-cooked New York to 1,000-degree coal-fired. Tucked into the ground floor of a quaint Victorian, the sparse décor directs focus to the 12 styles of pizza on offer. It's always crowded, so expect a wait-and don't bring a big group. Pies and Italian-American dishes are as rich and complex as the space is simple, from the tangy, herbaceous tomato sauce lapping tender beef meatballs to the delicious interplay of soft quail eggs, smooth potato, and crisp guanciale atop a wood-fired pie. Can't wait? Gemignani also owns a quick-fix slice shop right next door, plus nearby Capo's, which focuses on Chicago-style pies.",0,0
1531,Atelier Crenn,Contemporary,4,"Neutral gray and very discreet, Atelier Crenn is almost camouflaged in plain sight. Inside, gracious servers keep the dining room low key and very serene. The décor follows suit with a ceiling comprised of a backlit reed canopy, twig-like fixtures, and unadorned wood tables. This is a place for celebrants as well as serious foodies. Warm and very competent servers explain dishes with the same painstaking detail and dexterity that the kitchen uses to place carrot jerky onto its mossy twig. Chef Dominique Crenn's cooking is at once whimsical and deeply accomplished, based on elemental expressions of the earth or sea. While the idea of ""poetic culinaria"" may seem self-indulgent to some, this cuisine is undeniably authentic, deeply personal, and filled with brilliant grace notes of flavor and creativity. Expect dishes that are light yet complex, such as fluke that seems ready to melt over tarragon ice, amid droplets of creamy smoked sturgeon, sea-cucumber dashi, and pickled Asian pears. Dark and intense spot prawn broth is so deeply flavored that it seems like you are tasting shellfish for the first time. A trio of aloe gelée, purée, and snow is incomparably refreshing and herbaceous.",2,1
1532,Central Kitchen,Californian,3,"A chic and sleek crowd of hip Mission foodies gathers at this trendy restaurant, nestled in a complex beside sister shop/deli Salumeria, cocktail bar Trick Dog, and coffee shop Sightglass. Wend your way to the central courtyard, with a trickling fountain and large glass doors leading into the main space, where a large open kitchen faces the simple wood tables. Select inventive dishes à la carte, or opt for a five- or six-course tasting menu. Along the way, you might taste seared tuna topped with earthy matsutake mushrooms and a silky avocado purée, or hen roulade with confit radishes and puntarelle. Their delicious desserts-maybe white chocolate with kiwi and nasturtiums or strawberries and fennel with black-garlic ice cream-are compelling.",0,0
1533,flour + water,Italian,2,"As the name implies, two ingredients create a world of possibilities at this always-packed Mission hot spot. Neapolitan pizzas and handmade pastas (like al dente garganelli with whole-grain mustard and braised pork) will have you sighing after each bite, and a new selection of more traditional mains (such as seared duck breast with chanterelles and pecorino-dusted charred Brussels sprouts), scores every bit as big as the noodles and pies. Laid-back service, up-to-the-moment music, and a buzzy, effervescent vibe make flour + water the epitome of California cool. Throw in a glass of their refined Italian wine along with an alluring dessert like the salted caramel apple tart, and you can see why getting a table here is well worth the challenge.",0,0
1534,Nico,Contemporary,2,"Pacific Heights is a dreamy little pocket of San Francisco, with its colorful Victorians and sweeping views of the Bay. It's one of those magical places that linger in the memory, and now the area has yet another reason to remember it by: the lovely, urbane Nico-a relaxed and sophisticated French bistro with a distinctly Californian vibe. The space houses only a 40-seat restaurant and a small bar area, but feels wonderfully expansive with its high ceilings, gleaming glass windows, seats overlooking Sacramento Street, and intimate tables with a view of the glass-enclosed kitchen in the back. Diners at Nico can choose between a three- or five-course dinner, listed off a menu that notes only the main ingredients. Co-owners Nicolas and Andrea Delaroque are essentially asking you to play a trust game-and you should not hesitate to jump. Razor-thin slices of crispy artichoke arrive fanned over cool green herb jus and topped with delicious minced escargot; while a dish of wildly fresh peas finds perfect pairing in basil, peaches and sweet ricotta. Tender seared duck breast, duck confit roulade, and duck liver mousse are plated with lentilles du Puy, fresh cabbage, and roasted hedgehog mushrooms for an earthy finish.",1,1
1535,Coi,Contemporary,4,"Even on the eve of its tenth anniversary, Coi manages to stay as fresh as the days when it first opened its doors. Its second decade is sure to be exciting as Daniel Patterson hands off his kitchen to a new and very talented brigade. The moniker translates to ""silent"" or ""quiet""-and indeed the restaurant owns a serene, Zen-like atmosphere with branches arching across the foyer; soft grey upholstered banquettes; bare wooden tables; supple brown leather chairs; and beautiful, conversation-worthy earthenware dishes. Service here is warm, refined and extraordinarily well trained-with a nearby sommelier at the ready with an impeccable wine list and a smile. Waiters quietly attend to every need of the stylish crowd. The kitchen's contemporary cooking is a joy to experience and the multi-course tasting menu showcases both incredible technique and pristine seasonal ingredients. Picture thinly sliced geoduck sashimi paired with crunchy, seasoned cucumber, shavings of radish, and violet-hued edible flowers. Then a bright, chilled English pea soup is poured over creamy buttermilk, soft yellow nasturtium and whole spring peas picked at their peak. Tender, bite-sized slices of aged duck find perfect company in vibrant spring greens, sprouted wheat berry, and a rich duck broth.",2,1
1536,Park Tavern,American,3,"North Beach favorite Park Tavern has a menu that spoils diners. Should you stick with the beloved Marlowe burger, or opt for a new plate like roasted sea bass with braised fennel and celeriac purée? The choices are plenty. Go another round with the time-honored Brussels sprout chips, or sample the newer lemon chips with burrata? Whatever you decide, you're unlikely to be disappointed. Options also abound in terms of seating-the sidewalk tables, window seats, and marble-topped bar counter are equally appealing. In terms of drinking: the house-concocted cocktails, local beers, and varied global wines will each call your name. The good news is that a second visit will allow you to try more, provided you can snatch a table away from the other regulars.",0,0
1537,Café Jacqueline,French,3,"You'll float away on a cloud at the first taste of Jacqueline Margulis' signature soufflés, light and fluffy masterworks that have kept her tables full for over 35 years. Since the chef makes each of her creations by hand, expect to spend three or so hours at the table-it's the perfect romantic escape for couples lingering over a bottle of wine. To sate your appetite while you wait, a bowl of light carrot soup or a delicate cucumber salad in a champagne vinaigrette will do the trick. But the soufflés are the real draw, and keen diners plan on both a savory and a sweet course. For the former, a combination of flaky salmon, tender asparagus, and caramelized Gruyère is a delight. And the utterly perfect lemon soufflé will haunt any dessert lover's dreams.",0,0
1538,Myriad,International,2,"Not sure what to eat tonight? Bring your indecision and your appetite to this globe-trotting gastropub, which turns out skillfully prepared dishes from across cultures. Whether you're feeling like a dose of Moroccan (roasted lamb sandwich with tomato jam and feta), Mexican (cochinita pibil), French (farm toast with fromage blanc and roasted plums), Italian (ricotta zeppole with caramel sauce), or any combination of the above, there's a dish that's sure to satisfy. And, there's also a selection of beer and wine to match every delightful bite. A new arrival to the Mission, Myriad sprawls over two long, narrow rooms, where hipster couples and families with kids trade bites of the shareable dishes.

1539,Anchor Oyster Bar,Seafood,2,"Landlubbers seeking a taste of the sea can be found pulling up a stool at this Castro institution, where waves of waiting diners spill out the doors. This tiny, minimally adorned space filled with old-fashioned charm is better for twosomes than groups. While the menu may be petite, it's full of fresh fare like a light and flavorful Dungeness crab ""burger"" on a sesame bun; Caesar salad combining sweet prawns and tangy anchovy dressing; or a cup of creamy Boston clam chowder loaded with fresh clams and potatoes. As the name portends, raw oysters are a specialty, so fresh and briny that the accompanying mignonette may not be necessary. And while the cioppino is only an occasional special, it's worth ordering if available, as it's a signature.",0,0
1540,Heirloom Café,Californian,3,"Though a nice selection of European vintages is a boon to this charming bistro housed in a quiet corner of the Mission, the delicate and seasonal food keeps it bustling. Fresh and elegant Mediterranean-leaning dishes are pure expressions of California's bounty. Sample the likes of seared scallops on a bed of fava beans and frisée with minced bacon and shallot-butter; or pan-roasted cod with cauliflower purée, English peas, and ramps. Simple desserts display a gentle touch, as in the polenta cake with macerated strawberries and tarragon cream. The dining room features communal tables, a marble counter with a close-up view of the open kitchen, whitewashed walls plastered with European wine labels, warm candlelight, and even warmer service.",0,0
1541,Lolinda,Argentinian,2,"Equal parts contemporary steakhouse and small plates spot, Argentine-inspired Lolinda is fun and sexy, loaded with twenty- and thirty-somethings gabbing over cocktails and sips of malbec. The soaring dining room with its wagon-wheel chandeliers and tufted-leather banquettes leads to a bustling second-floor mezzanine; whereas El Techo, a heated and more casual roof deck, offers sweeping views of the skyline. Sharing is encouraged and groups can be found divvying up plates of silky ono ceviche, flaky chicken empanadas, or sweet, caramelized pork belly. Bull sculptures and murals remind diners that the chargrilled steak or crosscut beef short ribs with chimichurri are must-orders-tender and smoky, they'll transport you to Buenos Aires in a flash.",0,0
1542,Kokkari Estiatorio,Greek,2,"Zeus himself would be satisfied after a soul-warming meal at this Greek favorite, which serves up San Francisco chic with a side of old-world taverna hospitality. Translation? Once you're seated at the bar or settled near one of the roaring fireplaces, the thoughtful staff will cater to your every need. Kokkari's sophisticated menu leans heavily on the wood grill and rotisserie, which produce smoky, juicy lamb souvlaki with warm pita and tangy chickpea salad; as well as charcoal-kissed, feta-stuffed calamari over fennel, oranges, and olive tapenade. Resist the urge to conquer the Olympus-sized portions: you'll want to sample the galaktoboureko, crispy phyllo rolls filled with creamy custard and topped with honey, figs, and crème fraîche ice cream.",0,0
1543,Bistro L'Aviateur,Mediterranean,2,"Touch down for a meal at this family-run Mission newcomer. Though it boasts a veritable collection of aviation-related décor (think chrome propellers and model airplanes), L'Aviateur is no hobbyist's shop. With vases of fresh flowers, chalkboard menus, and big front windows offering prime people-watching, it gives off the feel of a cozy neighborhood café. Depending on how you order from the Mediterranean-inspired menu, your palate could land in North Africa (piquant Tunisian lamb couscous), Burgundy (rich boeuf bourguignon), or Basque country (garlicky, herbaceous ratatouille and tender stewed chicken and sausage over buttery rice). But no matter how far-flung your journey, this is the kind of comforting fare that will make you feel right at home.",0,0
1544,Mama Ji's,Chinese,1,"Dim sum options outside of Chinatown and the Avenues are rare, which explains why this cute little Cantonese spot has become a Castro favorite in its first year. While the crowd is more local than Chinese, the bilingual menu is nonetheless full of authentic preparations, from the tender and flavorful xiao long bao to meltingly soft tofu topped with steaming shrimp in a soy-ginger broth. Service is basic but very friendly, and the simple, mini space is full of natural light from the quiet tree-lined street outside. Large groups should head elsewhere; but smaller ones will delight in sharing chewy, spicy cold noodles loaded with vegetables and chili paste, or roasted eggplant stuffed with gingery shrimp-especially at these prices.",0,0
1545,Bistro Aix,Mediterranean,2,"In the competitive Marina market, lovely Bistro Aix remains a charming and relatively affordable neighborhood option for thoughtfully made Southern French fare with a California touch. The dining room offers two distinct culinary experiences, beginning with seats in front at the convivial marble bar and small bistro tables. Beyond this, find the sunny bubble of the intimate back atrium, verdant with olive trees and flooded with natural light. A well-heeled crowd enlivens the space. Dishes are simple and well executed, like roasted eggplant with grilled sesame seeds, gypsy peppers, and a topping of creamy burrata; or the perfectly grilled ahi tuna with fried baby spinach and a spicy Port reduction. Nicely chosen French wines complement each dish.",0,0
1546,One Market,Californian,2,"Located at the very end of Market Street facing the Ferry Building, this perennial power-lunch spot draws crowds for its bright, bustling vibe and Bay views. High ceilings and a busy open kitchen catch the eye, while efficient bow-tied waiters attend to the booths and banquettes. Chef Mark Dommen's contemporary Californian food is fresh and seasonal, starting with Nantucket Bay scallops sautéed in brown butter with baby mustard greens in a pool of fermented black bean sauce, garnished with apple and puffed rice. This might lead to a colorful composition of seared flounder over flavorful black-eyed peas with smoky bacon and tart sofrito vinaigrette. Signature desserts like pear galette are sized as ""traditional"" or ""singular"" (half) portions.",0,0
1547,Californios,Fusion,4,"In contrast to the bohemian posture of its neighborhood, this sterling debut by Chef Val M. Cantu is a luxurious oasis. A gleaming open kitchen and burnt caramel-hued banquettes pop against the dark lacquered walls, while sparkling chandeliers and shelves of cooking and design books further punctuate the upscale look of this intimate room. You'll feel as though you're dining in a chef's private atelier, complete with a polished, professional, and tight-knit staff that delivers truly impressive service. While the feast set forth by Chef Cantu is inspired by Mexican flavors, it is modern Californian at its foundation. Produce plucked from nearby farms are transformed into stimulating bites to begin this tasting menu; highlights from which have included delicious interpretations of menudo featuring fresh raw hamachi slices doused with a succulent tripe broth; and esquites that top a creamy sweet corn pudding with charred kernels and decadent Santa Barbara uni. Fourteen-day dry-aged Wagyu ribeye cap is grilled over the binchotan and served with charred onion, dabs of avocado purée, tomatillo salsa, as well as puffy, griddled sourdough tortillas. And for dessert, if the sound of foie gras-and-coffee ice cream drizzled with cajeta seems crazy, just trust us-it's brilliant.",1,1
1548,Yank Sing,Chinese,2,"With a higher price tag than the average Chinatown joint, Yank Sing is arguably the place in town for dim sum. While peak hours entail a wait, one can be assured of quality and abundant variety from these rolling carts. The signature Peking duck with its lacquered skin and fluffy buns is a memorable treat, as are the equally sweet and salty char siu bao. Of course, dumplings here are the true highlight, from plump and fragrant pork xiao long bao, to paper-thin har gao concealing chunks of fresh, sweet shrimp. Don't see favorites like the flaky egg custard tarts? Just ask the cheerful staff, who'll radio the kitchen for help via headsets. The upscale setting is cheaper by day, but the zigzagging carts can get hectic. Things calm down a bit at dinnertime.",0,0
1549,Albona,Italian,2,"This brightly painted mid-century bungalow is nestled on a street with high-rises. Inside, find a petite, cozy, and brasserie-like dining room outfitted with velvet curtains and effusive waiters donning traditional waistcoats. Photographs on the walls depict the Istrian village from which the restaurant takes both its name and cuisine inspiration: the focus here is on the peninsula's cooking, where classic Roman and Venetian styles meet Croatian influences. The menu reveals delicious but somewhat unfamiliar dishes like pork involtini stuffed with sauerkraut and enhanced by preserved-fruit sauce; or cured sardines with raisins and pine nuts. While presentations aren't overly refined, it's the ultimate in comfort fare-deeply satisfying and very flavorful.",0,0
1550,Prospect,American,3,"For a polished and contemporary experience that doesn't sacrifice approachability, FiDi denizens turn to Prospect, a crowd-pleaser for the full-pocketbook crowd. Set on the ground floor of a soaring high-rise, its airy space offers attractive, roomy tables, adept service, and a popular, well-stocked cocktail bar. Simple, well-constructed American fare abounds, with menu mainstays like an heirloom tomato salad with creamy dollops of burrata and crisp, garlicky breadcrumbs; or a perfectly flaky Coho salmon fillet set over earthy black rice, sweet yellow corn, and caramelized summer squash. Dessert should not be missed: the butter brickle icebox cake with honey-glazed plums and toasted pecan butter crunch is a truly memorable treat.",0,0
1551,Delarosa,Italian,2,"People-watching aficionados will delight in this Marina favorite, where sidewalk tables afford a killer view of Chestnut Street's many stroller-pushing parents, awestruck tourists, and Pilates-toned socialites. Befitting the visual overload, bright orange is Delarosa's signature color and can be seen in light fixtures hanging over communal tables as well as eye-popping tiles in the kitchen. Simple, rustic Italian food steals the show, like spicy-smoky thin-crust pizzas topped with salami, coppa, and chopped chilies, or a fresh, flavorful salad of young kale with a pecorino-Caesar dressing. The laid-back vibe extends to the signature dessert: a trio of puffy, sugar-dusted bomboloni, served warm with chocolate, raspberry, and mascarpone dipping sauces.",0,0
1552,Aster,Californian,3,"Fine dining SF-style means hip soundtracks, spare spaces, and going to dinner in jeans, but this newcomer makes all of those trappings seem cool, never forced. Set in a quiet, residential corridor of the Mission, Aster's caramel-colored banquettes, wood tabletops, and strands of LED lights make for a studied, yet casual vibe. This is the kind of place where even the attentive, hospitable service manages to feel laid-back, but getting in will require some effort-If you can't score a reservation, line up early to snag a walk-in table. Start with an aperitif as you peruse Chef Brett Cooper's elegant menu, which deftly interplays sweet, tangy, earthy, and salty elements in dishes like blanched asparagus with egg yolk, grilled spring onions, and shreds of ham hock. Packets of black cod, wrapped in chard leaves and steamed until tender, arrive in a complex, smoky bone broth, while deliriously rich pork head croquettes are balanced by a zippy arugula salad with blood orange kosho. Aster's light food makes it easy to save room for the excellent desserts, including a decadent and refreshing beet-and-blood orange crémeux, or a raspberry meringue with just a hint of Sichuan peppercorn.",1,1
1553,Blackwood,Fusion,2,"For a hip, fusion-y take on Thai fare, Marina locals beeline to this stylish spot, which offers classic dishes like shredded mango salad with cilantro, scallions, and smoky tiger prawns, as well as more mod items such as grilled Wagyu flank steak massaged with a five-spice sauce, set atop ginger rice and garlicky long beans. Empanada-like samosas come stuffed with potato, caramelized onions, and carrots, accompanied by a light and refreshing cucumber-avocado salad. The sleek interior features tufted banquettes and enormous mirrors, but the prime perch is at their lovely front patio, with two fireside communal tables that face the hustle and bustle of Chestnut Street. Allow extra time for parking and expect a wait at weekend brunch-the most popular service.",0,0
1554,Piperade,Basque,2,"Basque Chef Gerald Hirigoyen blends the region's French and Spanish roots at this popular restaurant and favorite for business lunches. His roasted lamb gets a touch of Middle Eastern flavor thanks to merguez sausage and a sweet-smoky cumin-date relish, served with tender and caramelized roasted fennel bulb. A solidly Gallic apple galette is deliciously none-too-sweet, combining puff pastry, finely shaved apple slices, and decadant caramel sauce. Located among historic warehouses in a commercial district, this charming dining room features wood floors, brick walls, and chandeliers made from empty wine bottles. Hold a confab at the eight-person round table, or enjoy a solo glass of wine on the covered front patio and while away a warm afternoon.",0,0
1555,Tuba,Turkish,2,"In a city where Turkish dishes are too often folded into in an unsatisfying ""pan-Middle Eastern"" menu, this bona fide charmer bursts with authentic flavor, as evidenced by its sizable clientele of handsome expats. Tuba's space is warm and welcoming, with crimson walls, soft, romantic lighting, and a friendly staff. Start with a selection of meze like sigara boregi (thin phyllo-dough pastries filled with potatoes and peppery feta) and moist, fluffy falafel. Then dive into a smoky ground beef kebab with spicy chopped bell peppers and zesty spices. Desserts like the künefe, a mild white cheese wrapped in phyllo, soaked in syrup, and topped with pistachios, are worth saving room for, especially with a strong Turkish coffee or intensely flavored tea.",0,0
1556,Dragon Well,Chinese,1,"This Marina mainstay nestled among the posh boutiques of Chestnut Street has been at it for over a decade. Westernized classics crafted with fantastically fresh ingredients are the secret to their ongoing success. Inside, high ceilings with sunny skylights and butter-yellow walls evoke an airy feel, while framed photos depict the everyday life of the vast Chinese culture. Pop in for a shopping break and nosh on tasty tea-smoked duck, served with hand-made steamed buns, thick hoisin sauce, and julienned leeks; or Chinese chicken salad, mixed with cilantro and a lemon-soy vinaigrette. The Kung Pao chicken, stir-fried with roasted peanuts and chili sauce, is fiery but never overpowering. Sweeten things up with a chocolate (or traditional) fortune cookie.",0,0
1557,Boulevard,Californian,3,"Housed in one of the city's most historic buildings, this Belle Époque stunner is still breathtaking after more than 20 years, with glamorous mosaic floors, colorful glass, and polished bronze at every turn. The Embarcadero-adjacent location offers lovely views of the Bay Bridge and the water, and business lunchers as well as evening romance-seekers adore its transporting vibe. Chef/owner Nancy Oakes is known as a pioneer of Californian cooking, with comforting takes on standards like Dungeness crab with avocado and ruby-red grapefruit, burrata served with a side of shaved kale, and flaky halibut over a mashed potato cake. Sweets are notable: try the pear- and apple-studded winter symphony crisp or creamy butterscotch pudding with pecan granola for a bit of bliss.",0,0
1558,Papito,Mexican,1,"Owned by the team behind nearby Chez Maman, this taqueria has a French touch that complements its sunny, bistro-like environs on the slope of Potrero Hill. The colorful walls and tightly packed tables lead to a semi-open kitchen full of energy and movement, where servers may be snappy without ever sacrificing timely presentations. Start with the zippy ensalada Papito, packed with avocado, crispy tortilla strips, and cilantro dressing. Then, dig into the giant mushroom quesadilla with Oaxaca cheese or crisp rock cod tacos with chipotle mayo and cabbage slaw. Well-crafted Mexican entrées, a flavorful salsa selection, and a fully-stocked bar further cement Papito's status as a neighborhood favorite spot for a quiet lunch or bustling dinner.",0,0
1559,Viva Goa,Indian,1,"The Portuguese-influenced cuisine of Goa typically gets less play in the States than that of its northern neighbors. But Goan food takes center stage in this sparse, low-key dining room decked with burgundy booths. The kitchen is skilled at preparing delicious dishes like a spicy bronzed curry with prawns and coconut milk or channa xacutti, a creamy concoction of chickpeas, fresh coconut, onion, carrot, and poppy seeds. The less adventurous can opt for more familiar Indian items like crisp, golden-brown samosas filled with potato and peas, and chewy, smoky naan studded with garlic and fresh cilantro. Takeout and delivery are the core of the restaurant's dinner business, so those in search of a lively scene might prefer the crowd-drawing (and budget-friendly) lunch buffet.",0,0
1560,Gary Danko,Contemporary,4,"It is clear what all the fuss is about, right from the moment one enters this polished wood veneer sanctum of Chef Danko's revered dining room. Dressed-up occupants in the mood to celebrate are bathed in flattering light and surrounded by a rainforest's worth of orchids. Service is without reproach and displays an uncommon loyalty; diners here experience a level of hospitality usually reserved for luxury hotels. Customizable tastings allow guests to mix and match their own three- to five-course meals from a menu of classic cooking layered with global inspiration. Pan-seared quail salad features a crispy rosemary-scented potato cake, sautéed maitake mushrooms, and wild greens-an eye-catching composition united by a warm pomegranate-sweetened dressing. Intensely crisp soft-shell crabs are even easier to love when nestled in a bed of white polenta scattered with black sesame seeds, enhanced with pickled ginger and zesty lime to cut the richness. Banana tart with rum pastry cream, caramel sauce, and coconut sorbet is a fine choice for dessert, made even sweeter when paired with an after-dinner selection from the outstanding wine list boasting over 2,000 bottles from around the globe.",1,1
1561,Mamacita,Mexican,2,"An eclectic mix of young families, stylish hipsters, and see-and-be-seen Marinaites may pack its tables, but this hot ticket has more to offer than looks alone. The talented kitchen's creative takes on Mexican flavors are always on-point, from shrimp ""al pastor"" tacos with a sweet-spicy apple-mango salsa, to molotes, masa fritters oozing a delectable mixture of smoky ground beef and Monterey Jack cheese; as well as esquites, chile-inflected roasted corn with cotija and crema. Mamacita's food is deeply flavorful, varied, and made for sharing (but you'll want to make a reservation if you bring a big group, because just about everyone has the same idea). Stuck with a wait? Head to the front bar for a tasty mezcal cocktail or three to help ease the sting.",0,0
1562,Coqueta,Spanish,2,"Local diners have a full-blown infatuation with Michael Chiarello's city-side spot, though its name is Spanish for ""flirt."" The handsome dining room is a rustic-chic and masculine display of cowhides, distressed wood, and stone, with huge windows overlooking the Embarcadero. All this makes the crowded Pier 5 restaurant a highly coveted reservation. The Spanish fare has some California lightness (order extra). Begin with oblong, crunchy fried and chicharrón-encrusted chicken croquetas filled with English pea mousse. Toasted sandwiches of smoked salmon with queso fresco and truffle honey are tasty little bites. Desserts are a slam dunk with a touch of sweet-don't miss the lush Manchego cheesecake dipped in caramel-white chocolate with caramel corn.",0,0
1563,Beretta,Italian,2,"A lively vibe, strong cocktail program, and late hours (until 1:00 A.M. nightly) ensure that the crowds have yet to abate at this longtime Mission hot spot. The menu is packed with flavorful Italian items and delicious antipasti like rich and chunky eggplant caponatina with oozing burrata drizzled in excellent olive oil. Crisp, thin crust pizzas are another highlight, with tangy sauce and cured meats like spicy salami and coppa. A handful of booths offer a more private experience, while a large communal table serves the walk-in crowd. Whether you're spending an evening amid the glow of Edison bulbs and the clink of cocktail shakers or munching on a brunch-time pizza carbonara at a sunny outdoor table, you'll exit both sated and energized.",0,0
1564,The Slanted Door,Vietnamese,2,"Reservations are a challenge at this modern stunner with a killer view of the Bay Bridge, which has managed to stay atop tourists' hit lists even as its NorCal spin on Vietnamese food has steadily become more uninspired and corporate. It's an efficient, professional place, but with little warmth; the hospitality is hit-or-miss at best. Steer clear of the overpraised cellophane noodles with crab or overpriced shaking beef, and stick to more solid offerings like gau choy gow, pan-fried dumplings with Gulf shrimp and vibrant garlic chives accompanied by a zippy soy and fish-sauce dip. Half-orders are encouraged, so take advantage by sampling more than one of the delectable vegetable sides, like crisp, spicy broccoli with pressed tofu.",0,0
1565,A16,Italian,2,"An undying favorite of yuppies, families, and tourists alike, A16 is known for rustic Italian cooking and a vast selection of delicious, unusual wines from all over the boot. Dinner reservations are indispensable, especially if you want one of the prime counter seats facing the open kitchen and wood-burning pizza oven. The menu's pies, pastas, and antipasti change with the season, so you could sample anything from perfectly al dente bucatini with roasted cherry tomatoes, garlic, and flaky white anchovies to grilled bruschetta piled with caramelized prosciutto, creamy ricotta, cherry tomatoes, and blistered shishito peppers. For dessert, look no further than the fig crostata with vanilla gelato, which tastes like the work of a particularly talented nonna.",0,0
1566,Epic Steak,Steakhouse,3,"A meal at Epic is a ticket to a wondrous view-the Bay Bridge arching over the gentle water with Treasure Island across the way, plus the twinkle from The Bay Lights installation, which promises to shine again in early 2016. It's so pretty that you might struggle to keep your eyes on the plate. This roast house's surroundings are no slouch either, with a clubby, leather-clad dining room leading to a terrace designed for sunny afternoons. As the name promises, meat is the big draw here, with juicy, tender cuts of everything from American prime beef to Japanese Wagyu. An old-school shrimp cocktail, fish dishes, and even venison round out the offerings, and a wine list rich with bold reds complements the cooking. At night, prices can get high; consider lunch for a more affordable visit.",0,0
1567,Spruce,Californian,3,"Set in one of San Francisco's snazziest neighborhoods, Spruce draws a regular crowd of wealthy retirees and corporate types by day; evening brings couples out for date night. The dining room is masculine yet modern, with velvet banquettes, studded leather chairs, and splashes of charcoal and chocolate. A small front café serves coffee and pastries, while the marble bar lures happy-hour crowds for a lengthy choice of cocktails or glass of wine from their extensive global list. Micro-seasonal and delightfully Californian, Spruce's cuisine spotlights Mediterranean cooking that is at once simple and undeniably elegant. Rustic and homey starters may include a savory turkey soup stocked with thick, toothsome strands of tagliatelle, sliced carrots, and tender white meat. Pan-roasted black cod begins as a beautifully seared skin-on fillet, which is then topped with smoked cherry tomatoes and plump borlotti beans, further elevated with a quenelle of basil pesto and fresh herb leaves. For dessert, miniature vanilla bean-speckled panna cotta is artistically plated alongside a swipe of silky crémeux infused with Kaffir lime, a neat scoop of blood orange sorbet, granola, and pomegranate arils.",1,1
1568,Waterbar,Seafood,3,"Stunning views of the Bay Bridge are the chief draw at this Embarcadero fave for sipping wine on the lovely terrace and slurping oysters at the enormous raw bar. Though the polished, modern dining room can seem serious (as can the expense account-rocking prices), warm and thoughtful service brings things back down to earth. Seafood-centric entrées make global use of the local waters' bounty by way of tender squid almost bursting with chorizo alongside candy-like chickpeas. Perfectly crisp pan-roasted striped bass atop flavorful wild rice oozes with delectable flavors and textures; and an Americana-influenced dessert menu (think carrot cake ice-cream sandwiches with rum-raisin sauce) is the final touch in ensuring that Waterbar stays packed to the gills.",0,0
1569,Sociale,Italian,2,"Italian in name but Californian in spirit, Sociale is a go-to for comfort fare that blends the best of both worlds. Creamy burrata is served over pumpkin purée and garnished with pepitas and pecans, while braised pork belly with a wine sauce melts in the mouth. Dessert is a must; you'll be hard-pressed to find a table that can resist ordering the signature chocolate oblivion cake, a sinfully rich ganache accented with olive oil, sea salt, and amaretti cookie crumble. Located at the end of an alley with a quiet heated patio, the vibe here is bistro-chic, with a hint of European flair accented by the warm, accommodating staff and the Italian and French chanteuses on the playlist. It's the kind of neighborhood gem that everyone wishes they had on their block.",0,0
1570,Hong Kong Lounge II,Chinese,2,"While lesser Chinese restaurants struggle to balance quality dim sum with equally tasty dinner entrées, Hong Kong Lounge II does it all. As a result, it's become one of the Richmond's biggest draws, with big crowds on weekends and Chinese families packing the round banquet tables at lunch and dinner. The pretty interior's rose walls, wood screens, and white tablecloths are another attractive step up from the competition. Bring a group to fully sample the array of winning dishes, including handmade soup dumplings, tender honey-glazed barbecue pork, salt-and-pepper tofu fritters, and an excellent mushroom rice-noodle roll. Skip the steamed pork buns and opt for the fluffy baked ones-their crisp, slightly sweet, and very unique topping is a real highlight.",0,0
1571,Carmel Pizza Company,Pizza,1,"Don't let the touristy Fisherman's Wharf address keep you from visiting as this ruby-red gem serves delicious wood-fired Neapolitan pies that belie its environs. (And in a bid to draw more patronage, the popular spot has covered and heated its rather special patio, a godsend on chilly afternoons.) With eight to ten daily pies to choose from, there's something for everyone. Bring the kids and go to town on the zesty Diavola, topped with spicy salame, minced pepperoncini, and crisp arugula, or try the classic Americana, a tasty mix of ham, onion, sausage, mushrooms, and black olives. And the crust? Oh, the crust: it's thin, chewy, and well salted, with blistered, perfectly caramelized edges. Why should out-of-towners get to have all the fun?",0,0
1572,Padrecito,Mexican,2,"Like its baby sib Mamacita, this easygoing cantina serves modern Cal-Mex food crafted with excellent, locally sourced ingredients. Padrecito bears a bohemian, south-of-the-border spirit with a buzzy cocktail bar that pours a remarkable list of tequilas. Its dining room is rife with reclaimed wood, but climb a few colorful steps to arrive in the lovely mezzanine decked in chandeliers glinting over the main room. Adept, smiling servers whirl around diners cradling such specials as sopa Azteca, a purée of ancho chilies and tomato bobbing with tender queso Oaxaca and avocado; or grilled Arctic char tacos sauced with crimson-red achiote and crowned with mango-jicama slaw. Warm, sugary churros with mascarpone-coffee crema offer mucho fulfillment.",0,0
1573,Paprika,Eastern European,1,"Diners who set foot into Paprika, named for one of the most essential spices in Eastern European cooking, should prepare to feel as if they've been transported to Prague. It's a simple, no-frills, cash-only kind of place, but cheerful service, affordable fare, and a vast selection of European draft beers make for a relaxed, enjoyable atmosphere. The small menu manages to cover all the bases, from tender, well-seasoned pork goulash packed with sweet tomatoes, caramelized onions, garlic, and zippy paprika, to a smoky, blistered Polish kielbasa over creamy mashed potatoes and paprika-infused gravy (you'll want some bread to soak up every last drop of this). Snag a table at one of the bay windows, then settle in to enjoy your meal with a stein of beer, of course.",0,0
1574,Greens,Vegetarian,2,"Annie Somerville's pioneering vegetarian restaurant has been around since 1979, but neither the menu nor the surroundings show Greens' age. Instead, fresh, energetic cuisine abounds, with a light touch and a slight Italian bent. Brunch draws a big crowd, so be prepared to wait for those perfectly fried eggs over griddled potato cakes. Vegetarians and carnivores will rejoice after sampling the honest, colorful, down-to-earth seasonal entrées at dinner, followed by delightful desserts like an huckleberry upside down cake with a subtle kick from Meyer lemon. Housed in historic Fort Mason, the warehouse-style space is rustic yet refined, with sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge and sailboats on the Bay. For a quick lunch, there's also a to-go counter.",0,0
1575,Papalote,Mexican,1,"Head to this little standout for a lighter take on the gut-busting taqueria treats that define the Mission. Papalote manages to deliver the goods without the guilt, and the difference is clear in the outstanding fish tacos: corn tortillas piled with fresh, flaky white fish (sautéed in butter and garlic) along with sliced romaine and chopped tomato. Unlike the competition, Papalote doesn't have a salsa bar, but it doesn't need one: its defining feature is its gobsmackingly good, house-made roasted tomato salsa, which you'll want to slather on dishes like the pitch-perfect breakfast burrito, stuffed with scrambled eggs, chorizo, cheese, and guacamole. The space and service are bare-bones, but with food this good, you won't care.",0,0
1576,Prubechu,Chamorro,2,"Owned by two natives of Guam, Prubechu is the only Bay Area restaurant that serves the island's Chamorro cuisine. It's a shoebox-sized space without a full kitchen, but the intrepid staff manages to turn out utterly unique, utterly delicious meals like none you've ever had. Diners can choose between a tasting menu offering intricate Chamorro interpretations, or a small selection of homey, à la carte dishes. Either way, the results are thrilling, from a flavorful chicken sausage steamed with luscious coconut milk in a banana leaf, to umami-rich dried pork shoulder with nettle purée. The nutty, creamy toasted rice porridge with caramel soy and a tempura-battered soft-cooked egg is a standout, as is a gently sweet and caramelized banana donut.",0,0
1577,STEM Kitchen & Garden,Mediterranean,2,"Plenty of restaurants boast about their garden-fresh menus, but this Mission Bay freshman means business: most of its ingredients come straight from the raised garden beds on the rooftop patio, which also double as decorative elements. With its buzzing bocce courts and stunning fire-pit seating overlooking the Bay, it's already become a favorite among the staff at the nearby UCSF complexes. Simple, delicious food is the order of the day. A salad of garden lettuces in Meyer lemon vinaigrette is delicate and bright, while a blistered pizza comes loaded with broccoli de ciccio, guanciale, and mozzarella. Piquant berbere-spiced chicken plays surprisingly well with a tangy kale Caesar, and the tart, creamy, unmissable Meyer lemon verrine is like spring in a glass.",0,0
1578,Sous Beurre Kitchen,French,2,"Largely Hispanic 24th Street might seem like an odd place to find this captivating Cal-French rookie, but it's quickly distinguishing itself as a classy-yet-casual alternative to the taqueria grind. The European vibe extends to the dining room, decked with delicate mismatched china and vintage sconces, and tax and tip are included in the prices-so what you see is what you'll pay. The name may suggest dishes swimming in butter, but Sous Beurre's food is actually light and delicate. Silky house-smoked trout comes with a bright salad of arugula, golden beets, and shaved fennel; and spelt is dressed up with spring asparagus, creamy shallot soubise, and mint. Even the strawberry beignets, served over warm sabayon, feel fresh, balanced, and never too heavy.",0,0
1579,Saru,Japanese,2,"Hilly, idyllic Noe Valley is the perfect setting for this little jewel of a sushi restaurant, whose L-shaped counter and handful of tables are always full. The menu is thoroughly Japanese, with a few quirky California touches-think grilled shishito peppers tossed with ribbons of crunchy daikon in a ponzu dressing. Be sure to start with the perfectly sized tasting spoons, two tiny helpings of rotating specials like tuna tartare with yuzu kosho or monkfish liver with grated radish and scallions. Though rolls are available, regulars opt for the excellent nigiri, which might include marinated wild sardines, soy-kissed madai, and creamy uni. If you'd like the chefs to choose, several omakase (including an all-salmon variation) are also on offer.",0,0
1580,Al's Place,Californian,2,"Fresh, seasonal vegetables and seafood headline this fantastic new Mission District restaurant, where Chef Aaron London has managed to deftly recast proteins in a supporting role. Straddling a sunny corner, Al's Place sports a bright blue façade and a kind of cheery, seaside, and retro-chic interior where tables are set with kitchen towel napkins and pendant lights glint against the natural light flooding into every corner. The service staff is friendly and attentive, but delightfully unfussy. The restaurant's mix-and-match menu is easily shared, and dishes are light, incredibly flavorful and informal in all the right ways. Chef London combines thought-provoking flavors (think sunchoke with black lime) with ease, layering dimensions you didn't know existed. A soft and creamy plate of burrata finds its match in a coat of crunchy potato chips, and is plated with nutty potato skin mousse, grilled young asparagus, currant soffritto, and Miner's lettuce; while tonarelli is paired with vibrant green garlic purée, citrusy bergamot and briny, grated bottarga. For dessert, don't miss the buttery Meyer lemon tart, studded with sweet strawberries and paired with creamy lavender ice cream.",1,1
1581,Contigo,Spanish,2,"Contigo is Spanish for ""with you,"" and you'll certainly want to bring some of your favorite people along to linger at this Iberian charmer's warm dining room and pretty back patio. Sustainability is a watchword here: the design incorporates re-used and recycled materials, and each dish reflects the season's best ingredients. Tempting small plates include smoky caramelized coca (flatbread) with garlicky house-made txistorra pork sausage, Manchego, and sliced summer squash. Simple yet delicious offerings go on to feature slices of crusty levain topped with smashed fresh peas, roasted porcini, trumpet mushrooms, and more Manchego shavings. Their outstanding pork-lamb-jamón meatballs in a tangy tomato-sherry sauce are among the best albondigas you'll find.",0,0
1582,Chapeau!,French,2,"For an oh-so-French experience on Asian food-centric Clement, denizens head to Philippe Gardelle's authentic bistro, where tightly spaced tables and paintings of the titular hats create a convivial atmosphere. Packed with regulars receiving bisous from the chef, Chapeau! is warm and generous, a vibe that's aided by its strong Gallic wine list. Dishes are traditional with a bit of Californian flair, like fingerling potato chips in a friseé and duck confit salad or salted-caramel ice cream that tops the pain perdu. The cassoulet, wholesome with braised lamb, rich with smoky sausage, and earthy with white beans, is perfect for a foggy night in the Avenues. Come before 6:00 P.M. on weeknights for a $36.95 early bird prix-fixe, or create your own from their many set menus.",0,0
1583,Piccino,Pizza,2,"A progenitor of the increasingly hot Dogpatch restaurant scene, Piccino embodies the neighborhood's many flavors, drawing families with kids in tow, young tech types, gregarious retirees, and more. Its memorable yellow exterior houses a relaxed, artsy-urban interior with lots of wood and natural light, a perfect venue for unwinding with friends. Everyone comes here for deliciously blistered pizzas like the funghi, with roasted mushroom duxelles, sautéed wild mushrooms, stracchino, and slivers of garlic. Though pizza is a focus, Piccino excels in appetizers like tender, skillfully prepared polpette in tomato sauce, and must-order desserts such as a delectable hazelnut-cocoa nib cake. Their adjacent coffee bar is an area favorite.",0,0
1584,Wako,Japanese,3,"The area feels workaday and the exterior is understated from first glance, with a simple noren over the door and dark wood blinds. Yet Wako is a truly lovely little sushi-ya that vies to be among the city's best. The buzz here has been rightly earned and spread quickly. Don't bother showing up without a reservation-these tables and stools are packed well in advance. Still the vibe remains fun with foodies and chefs chatting along the blonde wood bar. Both omakase and à la carte offerings underscore the talented kitchen's vision of approachable, well-crafted dishes that satisfy Eastern and Western palates. Begin with a progression of superb small plates like house-made sesame tofu with dashi gelée, or small-bodied firefly squid in uni sauce with a touch of yuzu. Deliciously thick, precise cuts of toro, amberjack, and golden eye snapper arrive with a smoky house-brewed soy sauce, grated yuzu, and wasabi. Tempura does not disappoint as light and crunchy morsels of tiny smelts, sweet potato, and green beans with sea salt and fresh lemon. Wako's excellent quality sushi is downright sublime-whether brushed with salty-sweet soy, tucked with shiso, or topped with tobiko over pitch-perfect rice.",1,1
1585,Burma Superstar,Burmese,2,"Like any celebrity, it's easy to recognize this unusual dark wood superstar from the eager crowds swarming like paparazzi. Everyone endures this no-reservations policy to Instagram their favorite Burmese dishes. See the iPhones poised over the famed rainbow and tea-leaf salads or samusa soup (also available as a lunchtime combo). Regulars stick to traditional items, marked by asterisks on the menu. Palate-tingling options include rice noodles with pickled daikon and tofu in a spicy tomato-garlic sauce, or pork and kabocha squash stewed in a gingery broth with coconut sticky rice. A creamy Thai iced tea is the perfect counterbalance to the spicy, boldly flavored fare. Hipper digs, a cooler crowd, but renovated favorites can be found at sib-Burma Love.",0,0
1586,Kitchen Istanbul,Turkish,2,"This cheerful Inner Richmond spot has retained the chef, managing team, and décor of previous occupant Troya, but taken its menu in a more exclusively Turkish direction. The results-like a sublime lentil soup richly puréed and made slightly tart with lemon, or a juicy, perfectly grilled duo of lamb meatballs over basmati rice-will transport you to the Aegean sea. A Mediterranean oasis surrounded by dozens of Chinese restaurants, Kitchen Istanbul is bright and well-lit with red walls donning sleek black-and-white framed photos.

This draws a relaxed and funky crowd for comfort-food favorites. Dig into a vibrant heirloom-tomato salad with wedges of ripe peaches, sourdough, and creamy pecorino vinaigrette. Move on to slow-cooked pork belly with a smoked oyster-Thousand Island sauce and velvety soft-cooked egg. The American menu shifts with the seasons, but a few dishes are constants, like the blue-plate meatloaf or fried chicken with cornbread. At nightfall, large groups and couples pack this long and narrow space to share slices of tangy key lime pie. Warm up from the winter chill at tables near the vibrant open kitchen.",0,0
1588,Ichi Sushi + Ni Bar,Japanese,3,"Gone are the days when dining here was marred by the memory of how hard it was to score a table-this new space down the street is much bigger than the previous spot, now Ichi Kakiya Oyster Bar. Relaxed and casual, with a big, fun mural on one wall, it's an über-busy smash among tech types and hipsters. Hit the central sushi bar for nigiri, or opt for izakaya dishes and sake (but no sushi) at adjacent Ni Bar. The cognoscenti opt for the omakase, which might kick off with oysters garnished with yuzu juice and bits of caviar, followed by piping hot grilled skewers of tender and juicy miso-glazed pork. The nigiri pack punches of flavor from yuzu kosho or ponzu sauces and unique garnishes. The fish (maybe sea bream, Hokkaido scallops, ocean trout, or uni) are always fresh and delicious.",0,0
1589,The Commissary,Californian,2,"Once an officer's mess for the soldiers of the Presidio, this historic space now offers more refined cooking, courtesy of superchef Traci Des Jardins. Inside, communal wood tables, a bustling chef's counter, and antique light fixtures honor the past while allowing for modern comfort. Dine alfresco on the big front porch, facing the former parade grounds, or grab cheese, wine, and charcuterie from the in-house shop. The menu takes its cues from Spain, with richly seasoned chicken basquaise in a peppery tomato broth and bacalao salad strewn with fennel, olive, pomelo, and basil. Jamón Ibérico, gazpacho, and churros also make appearances. For a double dose of Des Jardins, head to nearby Arguello, her Mexican concept in the Presidio Officer's Club.",0,0
1590,Lavash,Persian,2,"You'll feel like you've dined in a Persian home after leaving family-run Lavash, which has become a neighborhood fixture thanks to warm service and sizable portions. Painted in hues of orange, gold, and rose, the casual and flower-filled space is inviting, and throughout a meal here, you'll see locals dropping in for takeout or just to chat. Begin your feast with sabzi panir, a plate of fresh herbs, feta, cucumber, tomato, walnuts, and grapes that's perfect for ad hoc toppings on the cracker-like namesake bread. Then order up a skewer or two of tender and smoky ground beef and lamb koobideh, served over fluffy basmati rice. Finally, don't miss the crispy, sticky-sweet baghlava-it's available in traditional pistachio or as a chocolate ""choclava.""",0,0
1591,La Ciccia,Italian,2,"Sardinian cuisine takes the spotlight at this family-run charmer, which draws a loyal crowd of Noe Valley regulars-particularly parents on a well-earned date night. The intimate, dark green dining room is always full, and nestled right up against the kitchen, from which the chef regularly pops out to greet guests in a blend of Italianenglish. Start with the house-made bread and the home-cured salumi of the day (think citron-studded mortadella). The pasta longa with cured tuna heart slivers twirls fresh, delicious linguini with sea urchin and tomato, and an entrée of stewed goat is gamey but tender, served alongside braised cabbage, black olives, and fried capers. For a pleasant conclusion, cap it all off with the fluffy and airy ricotta-saffron cake.",0,0
1592,Park Chow,American,2,"Steps from the Golden Gate Park museums, Park Chow draws locals and tourists alike with its approachable and well-priced organic American comfort food. No matter the mood or time of day, something here will appeal. Options abound from kid-friendly mini-pizzas to lighter and healthier fare like a tangy beet and endive salad with creamy avocado and salty goat cheese. Find straightforward pleasure in the grilled free-range chicken BLT on a griddled bun with crisp fries. For dessert, don't miss the rustic ginger cake with pumpkin ice cream and caramel. The homey space is full of appealing nooks, including a dog-friendly front patio and sunny roof deck. Remember to call ahead to get your name on the wait list (especially for weekend brunch).",0,0
1593,Piqueo's,Peruvian,2,"Gather your friends for a trip to Peru (with a layover in Bernal Heights) at Piqueo's, where the menu of flavor-packed small plates is built for sharing. From crispy yucca balls stuffed with cheese to tender pork adobo over mashed sweet potatoes, hearty palate-pleasers abound. Sauces are a house specialty; the tender beef empanada boasts a trio of garlicky huacatay, creamy huancaina, and spicy rocoto. And where else can you sample a quinoa-blueberry flan? While not as glamorous as upscale sister La Costanera, Piqueo's has its own charm, thanks to a quaint atmosphere with wood floors and an open kitchen. It's a standby for Bernal families, who stroll over in the evenings to catch up with the friendly servers and dig into their favorite dishes.",0,0
1594,San Tung,Chinese,2,"If you don't know what to order, just repeat after us: dry-fried chicken wings. Tossed in a chili-flecked ginger glaze, they're the reason foodies flock to this tasty, Americanized Chinese spot, write their names on a whiteboard, endure a long wait on the sidewalk, and finally eat at a communal table with strangers. It's all part of the restaurant's ramshackle appeal (as are the ultra-affordable prices). Even if poultry's not your thing, the menu's other offerings are well worth the effort it takes to eat here: dry-fried prawns are tossed in a sweet-and-spicy chili-garlic sauce, and hot and salty twice-cooked pork is fried with a heap of bell peppers and dried red chilies. Tables turn fast, so don't plan to linger-but for a filling meal, this one's a winner.",0,0
1595,Sichuan Home,Chinese,2,"One of the brightest offerings on Geary Boulevard, Sichuan Home lures diners far and wide. Its spotless dining room is a vision of varnished wood panels and mirrors, with plexiglass-topped tables for easy chili oil clean-up and menus that feature tempting photos of each item. A sampling of the wide-ranging Sichuan cuisine should include tender, bone-in rabbit with scallions, peanuts, and a perfect dab of scorching hot peppercorns. Fish with pickled cabbage gets a delightfully restorative hit of bold flavors from mustard greens and fresh green chilies, and red chilies star in aromatic dry-fried string beans with minced pork. For dessert, rich and velvety mango pudding, topped with grapefruit sorbet and fresh pineapple, is a tropical treat.",0,0
1596,Kappou Gomi,Japanese,2,"Sushi-seekers should take a pass, but those yearning for elegant, traditional Japanese food will find kindred spirits at this precious gem. The serene, ultra-minimalist dining room isn't fancy, with only a few shelves of ceramics as décor. But, older Japanese women in traditional garb who run the show are endlessly polite and attentive so long as you're not raising a din-or requesting a spicy tuna roll. If you're able to go with the flow, you'll find much to adore on their menu, like umami-rich wilted mizuna salad with fresh fava beans and bonito sauce, or pale green edamame tofu with fresh cherries, cherry blossom noodles, and a sour-salty cherry paste. The exquisitely moist and flaky black cod, grilled with a slightly sweet sake marinade, is revelatory.",0,0
1597,La Corneta,Mexican,1,"Make sure you've got cash, plenty of patience to wait in line, and a huge appetite before arriving at this massively popular spot. Inside, vivid murals and walls painted in bright hues of orange and yellow create a cheery yet very clean atmosphere. Tasty favorites like burritos (beware of anything with the word ""super""-they mean it); made-to-order salmon tacos; nachos smothered in black beans, cheese, and guac; or shrimp and steak-stuffed quesadillas are all freshly made, utterly satisfying, and seriously filling. Place your order at the counter and stroll down the line to pick your protein (chicken, steak, prawns, or tofu), beans (black, pinto, or refried), and pico de gallo (hot or mild). If you still have room, go for a warm, sugary churro...bliss.",0,0
1598,Dragon Beaux,Chinese,2,"This Richmond Chinese newbie has a split personality that food fiends will adore: by day, it offers dim sum delights from the same owners as Daly City's acclaimed Koi Palace, while at night, it segues into spicy hot pot offerings. The dramatic, over-the-top space is lively in any light, thanks to its lit stone pillars, dark wood furnishings, and soaring ceilings. Dim sum seekers will have to take a number and wait (only parties of eight or more can reserve), but the rewards are numerous-think fluffy-sweet-smoky-salty barbecue pork buns, tender crab roe-topped siu mai, and exquisite roasted pork belly with crackly skin. Classic and ultra-flaky egg custard tarts and crunchy sesame balls offer a sweet finish, and pair nicely with the fragrant jasmine tea.",0,0
1599,Aziza,Moroccan,3,"Nestled in a quiet corner of outer Richmond, along a street peppered with little ethnic grocery stores, Mourad Lahlou's lovely Aziza doesn't knock you over upon arrival. But duck inside its worn blue door, and you'll find a warm hostess at the ready; a charming and softly lit interior lined with cozy booths; as well as a Moroccan-style lounge in the back, featuring low-slung seating and couches. The result is exotic but accessible-a spot as perfectly appropriate for lively young families with kids in tow as it is for a sultry rendezvous with your steady. Chef/owner Mourad Lahlou loves to turn traditional Moroccan cooking on its head, (in fact, there's not a tagine in sight) infusing irresistible dishes with a palpable Californian sensibility. The outcome is quite incredible, with sweet and savory flavors tangling in perfect harmony. It's hard to go wrong on this menu and you'll surely want to try a little bit of everything. But whatever you do, don't miss the kitchen's elegantly plated trio of dips. These may include silky cucumber yogurt and dill, smoky eggplant and a nutty piquillo pepper-almond dip; or the perfectly seared lamb loin and belly paired with creamy, green garlic-infused barley, grilled summer squash, and a flutter of fresh, peppery arugula.",1,1
1600,Pizzetta 211,Pizza,2,"This shoebox-sized pizzeria may reside in the far reaches of the Outer Richmond, but it's easily identifiable by the crowds hovering on the sidewalk to score a table. Once inside, you'll be greeted by pizzaiolos throwing pies in the tiny exhibition kitchen-ask for a counter seat to get a better view. The thin, chewy, blistered pizzettas each serve one, making it easy to share several varieties. Weekly specials utilize ingredients like seasonal produce, house-made sausage, and fresh farm eggs, while standbys include a pie topped with wild arugula, creamy mascarpone, and San Marzano tomato sauce. Whatever you do, arrive early: once the kitchen's out of dough, they close for the day, and the omnipresent lines mean the goods never last too long.",0,0
1601,Khan Toke Thai House,Thai,1,"Don your best dinner socks for this traditional Thai restaurant, where diners are asked to remove their shoes before perching on low cushions at the intricately carved tables. Service is as slow as a glacier, making it more suited to casual dining than business lunch. Still, Khan Toke is worth the wait. Awaken the senses with a bowl of enticingly pungent and spicy-sour tom yum soup, loaded with tomato, onion, and sliced lemongrass, finished with fresh cilantro. Then dive into gai ga prou, a delicious stir-fry of chicken and bell peppers studded with sliced Thai chilies. Indeed, chili-lovers who order dishes ""very spicy"" will get what they want. There is no shortage of firepower in the bamboo shoots with chili sauce and excellent Panang curry.",0,0
1602,Trattoria da Vittorio,Italian,2,"Mamma knows best at this West Portal hot spot, with home cooking imported straight from the kitchen of the owner's Italian mother, Mamma Francesca. One bite of her lasagna, rich with creamy ricotta and hearty Bolognese, will have you cheering ""Mamma mia,"" while oversized portions have some crying ""basta!"" A semi-open kitchen and cheerful staff add to the sense of homey hospitality. A kids' menu makes it an extra popular choice for families. Start meals with an immaculately fresh caprese salad, then sample a crisp pie from the Neapolitan wood-burning pizza oven. Don't miss the outstanding tiramisu: ultra-creamy and not overly sweet, these layers of espresso-soaked cake with whipped mascarapone and shaved chocolate won't require coaxing to scrape clean.",0,0
1603,Orexi,Greek,2,"Nestled away from the hustle and bustle in charming, village-like West Portal, Orexi offers a future-perfect twist on the classic Greek taverna. The long, narrow space, with its rustic wood beams, wood furnishings, and oversized mirrors, has a contemporary vibe that contrasts nicely with the homey food. The lunch menu is full of light, yet satisfying dishes, like a Greek salad packed with crunchy cucumber, ripe tomato, and tangy feta. A juicy, well-seasoned lamb burger is topped with goat cheese, tomato, and crunchy red onion. Dinner is heartier with moussaka, slow-braised lamb shank with orzo, and lamb chops among other options. At either meal, be sure to sample the kataifi, a baklava-like phyllo pastry filled with chopped toasted almonds.",0,0
1604,Taqueria Guadalajara,Mexican,1,"At this Mission mainstay for Cal-Mex treats, regulars place their order at the counter, watch the action unfold in the open kitchen located just beyond, and then settle into a vibrant mural-walled dining room that charmingly evokes the countryside and its way of life. Clay roof tiles, and handmade wood and leather seats stick to the rustic, very quaint theme that locals seem to have grown so fond of. Any item ordered ""super"" is usually heaped with cheese, sour cream, and fresh avocado. Case in point: a pollo asado burrito packed with Mexican rice, pinto beans, and smoky, tender grilled chicken. These may be meals in themselves, but other classics like al pastor and chile verde tacos, enchiladas, and fajitas continue to thrive as tried and true favorites.",0,0
1605,Outerlands,American,2,"For the residents of this foggy beachside community, this new hotspot is an ideal hangout. The salvaged wood-dominated décor is perfectly cozy, and all-day hours ensure crowds flock here for breakfast and Bloody Marys to start their day. A friendly staff, good, locally roasted coffee, and a nicely stocked bar with a fine listing of beers on tap persuade further lingering. Stop in for fresh baked pastries like coffee cake, scones, and glazed doughnuts; or dig into heartier fare like an open-faced sandwich topped with black eye pea purée, green tomato, and griddled ham slices. Once the sun sets over Ocean Beach, expect more ambitious cooking from the dinner menu, like smoked chicken with tomato panzanella and charred gem lettuce.",0,0
1606,Sutro's,Californian,3,"Set in the historic Cliff House, perched above the roaring Pacific, Sutro's would be worth a trip just for its commanding views of the rugged California coastline. But this SF landmark doesn't rest on its laurels; instead, it serves surprisingly good food. In season, Dungeness crab is unmissable here, whether in a terrifically colossal crab Louie with avocado mousse and hard-boiled eggs, or shatteringly crisp panko-crusted crab cakes over carrot hummus and lemon-tarragon aïoli. The tasty seafood-focused fare goes on to include mussels steamed in Anchor Steam beer and harissa; as well as a sautéed red trout sandwich with fennel, cucumber, and yogurt. After your meal, stroll the beach or visit the windswept ruins of the Sutro Baths next door.",0,0
1607,Barrel House Tavern,Californian,2,"The former San Francisco-Sausalito ferry terminal has found new life as this lovely Californian restaurant, which gets its name from its barrel-like arched wood ceiling. A front lounge with a crackling fireplace and well-stocked bar is popular with locals, while tourists can't resist the expansive dining room and back deck, which boasts spectacular views of the Bay. The cocktail and wine offerings are strong, as is the house-made soda program, which produces intriguing, never-too-sweet combinations like yellow peach, basil, and ginger. These pair beautifully with meaty Dungeness crab sliders coupled with watermelon-jicama slaw; though they might be too tasty to keep around by the time grilled swordfish and pork belly with white beans hit the table.",0,0
1608,Copita,Mexican,2,"Set sail aboard the Sausalito ferry for dinner at this Mexican smash, just steps from the harbor's bobbing yachts. Colorful and casual, Copita's most coveted seats are on the sidewalk patio (complete with partial views of the water and the quaint downtown), but a spot at the exceptionally well-stocked tequila bar or in the brightly tiled dining room is no disappointment. A light meal of tacos could include seared mahi mahi with pineapple pico de gallo and tomatillo salsa or tomato-accented chicken tinga with avocado and Mexican crema. Options abound for heartier appetites, like 24-hour carnitas and chicken mole enchiladas. And the lively surrounds are a hit with kids, who love sipping on the sweet house-made almond horchata.",0,0
1609,Poggio,Italian,2,"You might forget you're not on the Adriatic coast midway through a meal at this Sausalito standby, where the Italian flavors are authentic and the views of yachts bobbing in the harbor add to the charm. Local regulars and tourists alike arrive early to snag one of the prime sidewalk seats overlooking the main drag; inside, the elegant dining room boasts a roaring pizza oven. California-influenced appetizers like seared scallops with sunchoke purée and aromatic veal jus segue into comforting pastas-pappardelle tossed with braised pork ragout and parmigiano, anyone? Half-portions are available on every pasta and risotto, a bonus for those who want to save room for entrées like grilled yellowfin tuna with asparagus, green olives, and caramelized fennel.",0,0
1610,Sushi Ran,Japanese,2,"Chefs have come and gone at this Sausalito staple, but its Zen-like atmosphere and exquisite selection of raw fish haven't changed for upwards of a decade-and that's just how the regulars like it. With its charming beachside-bungalow ambience, attentive staff, and thoughtfully curated sake selection, Sushi Ran is as dependable as a restaurant can get. Start off with a small bite like shrimp tempura over crisp veggies, tobiko, and asparagus, or a steamed red crab salad with seaweed, cucumber, and sweet soy dressing. Then move on to the main event: meticulously sourced, extraordinarily fresh hamachi, big-eye tuna, steamed blue prawns, and Santa Barbara uni. Whether you choose sashimi or nigiri, the talented chefs will steer you right.",0,0
1611,Bar Bocce,Pizza,2,"As chill a hangout spot as they come, Bar Bocce is seemingly designed to while away the hours with its pretty view of the water, namesake bocce courts, and roaring fire pit. Friendly and casual, it's a place where an afternoon glass of wine can easily fade into a multi-hour dinner, shared with a group of friends on the heated patio overlooking Sausalito's harbor. Wood-fired sourdough pizzas, like a marble potato pie with fontina, bacon, and a fresh farm egg, are the heart of the menu, accented by antipasti such as shaved Brussels sprouts and pecorino salad or golden cod brandade fritters with a tangy citrus aïoli. Cheerful servers are always happy to recommend a bottle of vino (or three) to keep the festivities humming in the inviting little bungalow.",0,0
1612,Le Garage,French,2,"Cultivated French technique meets bold California tastes at this petite canteen, which, as advertised, is housed in a former garage (complete with roll-up doors). Flavorful bouillabaisse packed with fresh dorade, plump scallops, and local shellfish; or a beet-and-apple salad with mandarinquats and goat cheese; sealed by a tangy, buttery lemon tart are only some of the appealing menu options. Le Garage's building was used to construct World War II battleships, but these days, it's more likely to house well-dressed sailors fresh off their yachts in the harbor, as well as lunching locals from the neighboring businesses. With coffee and croissants each morning, brunch on the weekends, and a thoughtful Cal-French wine list, it's a standby at any time of day.",0,0
1613,Hong Kong East Ocean,Chinese,1,"Primo panoramic views of the Bay Bridge and cityscape give this two-story favorite well-deserved attention. The spacious dining rooms may appear slightly dated, but who cares, given the stunning waterfront scene? Lunchtime here at Hong Kong East Ocean is a dim sum affair. The place is packed with business folks savoring their xiao long bao (pork soup dumplings with fragrant, ginger-infused pork broth); fluffy pork buns; delicious rice noodle-crêpes filled with garlicky beef and cilantro; or steamed vegetable rolls, stuffed with sautéed mushrooms and wrapped in tofu. Nights draw a large crowd of local families who show up for seafood offerings such as wok-fried Dungeness crab with spicy herbs, or rock cod with ginger and scallions.",0,0
1614,Fish,Seafood,2,"Casual and family-friendly, this Sausalito seafood spot offers diners the choice of a bright and airy dining room with simple wood furnishings or an alfresco picnic table, both with great views of the harbor. If you dine outdoors, watch out for the local seagulls and crows, who are always ready to snag a snack from your plate (but provide great entertainment for the younger set). The cooking is fresh and flavorful, from a Dungeness crab roll with butter and chives to crisp Anchor Steam-battered halibut served with house-made wedge fries and tartar sauce. Check the chalkboard for the latest specials, like mussels with chorizo and fennel or grilled Monterey sardines. After dining, visit the raw seafood counter for a selection of items to cook at home.",0,0
1615,Brown Sugar Kitchen,American,1,"Its industrial West Oakland location is far from any sort of restaurant row, but visitors to this soul-food palace (open for breakfast and lunch only) will find plenty of company-mostly ahead of them in line. Over the years, Chef/owner Tanya Holland has built a loyal following of families as well as foodies who arrive early to avoid those long waits for tender, flaky biscuits and signature buttermilk fried chicken with a cornmeal waffle. Others go for the juicy jerk chicken with a kick of heat, cooled by mashed yams and pineapple-red onion salsa. The earthy, well-seasoned black-eyed pea salad is another favorite-and fittingly so. Casual and welcoming with a chill vibe and colorful look, BSK may be a crowd magnet, but it's earned the hype.",0,0
1616,Haven,Contemporary,2,"Locals continue to rely on this delight (part of the Daniel Patterson Group) for good food and a sleek, industrial-chic setting in prime Jack London Square. With windows facing the Square and counter seats offering great views into the open kitchen, it's hard to pick a perch; in either case, kick things off with one of the intriguing barrel-aged cocktails. The food is contemporary and seasonal, with exquisite ingredients in dishes like roasted Monterey squid with smoked fingerling potatoes, chorizo, and green olives, or lamb roulade with warm lentils and roasted fennel. For dessert, cinnamon churros with caramelized peaches and nasturtium whipped cream are quite divine. Haven now offers a fixed three- or four-course menu in the dining room as well as a limited à la carte at the bar.",0,0
1617,Cosecha,Mexican,1,"Even the pickiest Mexican abuela would be hard-pressed to turn down a meal at Cosecha, where the heartwarming blue-plate specials are made from scratch daily. Handmade tortillas stuffed with roasted yams and creamy Oaxaca cheese, or flaky fish and smoky chipotle crema are a cut above typical taqueria fare, while the chicken torta ahogada nearly bursts with tender grilled meat, soft pinto beans, garlicky guacamole, and spicy guajillo chile. Housed in Old Oakland's historic Swan's Marketplace, Cosecha draws a loyal crowd of business people at lunchtime and local residents in the evenings. They order at the counter, take a seat at the communal tables, and sip tangy, refreshing lime aguas frescas as they await the delicious creations in store.",0,0
1618,Miss Ollie's,Caribbean,2,"Raised in Barbados, Chef/owner Sarah Kirnon brings a taste of the Caribbean to her novel home in Old Oakland. Named after her grandmother, Miss Ollie's features an utilitarian-chic space, enlivened by corner windows, cheerful paintings, and deep orange bottles of house-made habanero sauce. Watch out-it rings with spice and packs a punch. Callaloo, ackee, chow chow, and giromon may not be words in the average foodie's vernacular, but Chef Kirnon presents them here, as part of a pleasing roster of dishes like phulourie-crisp garam masala-tinged split-pea fritters served with shado beni or tamarind chutney-washed down with sorrel, a sweet hibiscus punch. But, it's that familiar, moist, crispy fried chicken that takes the crown, so grab it if available.",0,0
1619,Desco,Italian,2,"After a tumultuous series of turnovers, this beautiful Old Oakland space has found a solid owner in Donato Scotti (of Redwood City's Donato Enoteca), who's given it an Italian spin. Inside, the exposed brick walls, copper-topped bar, wood-burning oven, and mosaic floors in the 1870s-era building are as captivating as the food is delicious. Desco's simple offerings are full of flavor, from a house-made charcuterie board of smoked duck, roasted porchetta, and rabbit terrine to golden pappardelle bathed in a thick lamb, red onion, and tomato sugo. For dessert, the pear-almond torta with hazelnut gelato is a must. The wine list boasts 50 Italian selections, half of which are available by the glass-no wonder the bar is so popular for happy hour.",0,0
1620,Battambang,Cambodian,1,"Embrace the unknown at one of the Bay Area's very few Cambodian restaurants. Though the menu may be unfamiliar to Western palates, Battambang boasts warm, hands-on service that will make any diner feel at ease. Don't let its gaudy exterior deter you: the interior is pleasant and tastefully adorned. The must-order here is the amok trei, a hard-to-find dish of catfish steamed in a fragrant banana leaf. Layered with red lemongrass sauce and coconut milk, it's utterly beguiling. Equally good is the spicy-sour yihoeur char tumpaing, a stir-fry of calamari and bamboo shoots with lemongrass and ground chili. Adventurous diners should also sample the omelet-like num banchev, an eggy rice-flour crêpe with chicken, prawns, sprouts, and a strong, funky fish sauce.",0,0
1621,Chilli Padi,Malaysian,2,"Shake up your Oakland Chinatown routine with a trip to this contemporary newcomer, which blends Malaysian and Chinese flavors into an interesting menu that's jam-packed with flavor. Kick things off with the terrific Chilli Padi Sampler, which features tangy green papaya salad, moist chicken satay, samosas, tofu fritters, and a delicious Malaysian-style roti with warm curry dipping sauce. From there, the mindful servers can recommend dishes like chili-soy chicken and vegetables served in a crisp taro nest, or classic char kway teow, flat rice noodles with shrimp, squid, and shrimp paste. With its dark wood floors and undulating fuchsia walls, the space is sleek and clean, which may explain why it has caught on with the largely local crowd.",0,0
1622,Encuentro,Vegetarian,2,"Recently relocated, Encuentro is now sitting pretty in an industrial-chic space fitted with large windows, lofty ceilings, and an easy-breezy front bar. Though it's minimal in a California-meets-Manhattan way, the kitchen promises maximum satisfaction via its haute (read: heavenly) take on vegan treats. Avocado bruschetta drizzled with olive oil and chili jam entices with a kick of spice, while baby kale and roasted veggies are enriched with toasted quinoa and a lemon-tahini dressing. Here, each menu item is so carefully composed and appetizingly prepared (think of empanadas stuffed with pumpkin seed piccadillo served atop pinto beans with cashew crema) that you won't miss the meat-which explains why the dining room is peppered with carnivores.",0,0
1623,Hopscotch,American,2,"A stone's throw from the heart of transitioning (read: gentrifying) uptown Oakland, Hopscotch's Kickstarter buzz may have died down, but its small size means that reservations are a must. Checkered floors and red-and-chrome chairs lend a retro diner vibe, but you'd be hard-pressed to find cocktails as intriguing as a Domino (combining Scotch, amaro, blackberry, and jalapeño) at some local greasy spoon. The winning American cooking boasts subtle Japanese influences like the kabocha pumpkin cake with fresh pomegranate seeds. In the same vein, a tangy and bright pomegranate-and-sunchoke salad offers a refreshing counterpoint to heartier options like the cheekily named ""first base"" burger topped with sesame aïoli and griddled beef tongue.",0,0
1624,Tribune Tavern,Gastropub,2,"The team behind foodie-mobbed Chop Bar resurrected an Oakland landmark for their latest project: the former newsroom of the iconic Tribune building. And baby boy is quite the looker, featuring luxe leather sofas, wine barrels, and stained glass casting an elegant light onto the horseshoe-shaped bar. Corporate types pack the bar for hearty, English-inspired items like a whole rabbit cooked down and presented as a jar of spreadable delight; Shepherd's pie bubbling with ground meat and topped with parmesan-potato mash; and a strawberry trifle sundae. Happy hour brings bites such as house pickled vegetables, smoked pork belly-stuffed dates, or the Tavern burger. Cocktails are stellar, while teetotalers are kept happy with house-made sodas.",0,0
1625,Koi Palace,Chinese,2,"Long regarded as one of the Bay Area's best spots for dim sum, Koi Palace continues to earn its serious waits (guaranteed on weekends, and common at weekday lunch). The dining room is a step up from its competition, with shallow koi ponds weaving between tables, high ceilings, and huge tables to accommodate the Chinese-American families celebrating big occasions. They come to share plates of perfectly lacquered, smoky-salty roasted suckling pig or sticky rice noodle rolls encasing plump shrimp, sesame oil, and minced ginger. Not far behind, find lotus leaves stuffed with glutinous rice, dried scallop, and roast pork, as well as big pots of jasmine tea. Save room for desserts like the fluffy almond cream steamed buns and flaky, caramelized custard tarts.",0,0
1626,Phnom Penh House,Cambodian,1,"Devotees in the know pray to the parking gods and push through Oakland's Chinatown crowds to get to one of the best Cambodian restaurants in the Bay Area. While the outside appears unassuming, the interior is a calm respite with colorful, native artwork and temple tiles. Expect a warm welcome from the family who runs this simple but pleasant place. The menu is full of flavorful, fragrant, and fresh dishes such as a vibrant salad of shredded green papaya, carrots, and delicious herbs tossed in a garlicky house-made vinaigrette.

1627,Amoura,Mediterranean,2,"In largely underserved South San Francisco, the arrival of this spacious Mediterranean spot was cause for celebration. With lots of tile and stonework, its polished vibe can run a bit corporate-but that's ideal for the large local office crowd who pack it at lunchtime. (Dinner, on the other hand, can be a bit sleepy.) Here, classic Mediterranean dishes come with modern twists: tender, smoky grilled lamb skewers are draped over tabbouleh with butternut squash and arugula, while a perfectly cooked roast chicken is drizzled with garlicky basil pesto. The notable drink menu includes a wine list rich with unusual Lebanese and Croatian vintages, as well as an impressive selection of arak, an anise-flavored liquor popular in the Middle East.",0,0
1628,Kamdesh,Afghan,1,"Cheerfully perched on a commercial corner in downtown Oakland, Kamdesh's sunny yellow façade is a welcome sight. Expect to find business folks at lunch, locals at dinner, and a take-out clientele all day long. Afghan kababs are all the rage here-perfectly seasoned, marinated, charbroiled, and absolutely mouthwatering. Try the lamb tikka kabab, moist and smoky with cumin, piled over fluffy pallow (brown basmati rice) infused with lamb jus and completed with a spicy cilantro chutney and salad. Other delicious options include tender mantoo stuffed with seasoned ground beef and onions, then drizzled with tangy yogurt sauce; or the flavorful charbroiled chicken wrap with yogurt, cucumber, tomato, mint, and red onion in a chewy, thick naan.",0,0
1629,Nido,Mexican,2,"The industrial area west of the I-880 freeway doesn't boast many good restaurants, but this hidden Mexican gem is an exception. Complete with hip reclaimed-wood décor and a local clientele of business people along with trendy foodies, it's definitely a cut above a taqueria in terms of quality and price, with fresher, lighter food in smaller-but by no means stingy-portions. At lunch, a trio of tacos includes moist pork adobado with a sweet-and-spicy pineapple salsa, grilled chicken with chamoy glaze, and smoky beef barbacoa with caramelized onions. Dinner brings pozole with chicken and chile negro, and a grilled pork chop with braised greens and almond mole. With a truly relaxed vibe and home cooked feel to the food, it's worth the extra effort to drop by.",0,0
1630,Duende,Spanish,3,"Savor the flavors and sounds of Spain at this novel restaurant in developing Uptown Oakland, where Chef/owner Paul Canales turns out everything from pintxos to paella. The voluminous bi-level space set in the historic Floral Depot is packed with large windows, exposed brick, and colorful murals which contribute a fun vibe attracting groups of hip, urban types. The food is authentic with seasonal accents and has included rabbit and lobster sausage with blistered Padrón peppers; and seafood-studded arroz negro, thick with rockfish, scallops, cherry tomatoes, and garlic aïoli. The crowd is loud and festive, especially when one of the rotating local musicians hits the stage for a set. Like the food and ambience, the music lends Duende a casual, warm energy.",0,0
1631,Riva Cucina,Italian,2,"A labor of love from an Italian chef and his American wife, this Berkeley favorite overflows with families and their bambini (who get their own special menu). While he turns out the rustic, flavorful dishes of his youth in the kitchen, she attends to guests in the high-ceilinged, brick-walled dining room or on the flower-decked front patio. Kick off a meal here with a fresh and vibrant panzanella packed with sweet heirloom tomatoes, diced cucumber, and shaved salty ricotta salata. Parsley-infused fettuccine is equally delightful, twirled with garlicky olive oil, mushrooms, and a dusting of truffled pecorino cheese. Finish with another study in delicious simplicity: the torta della nonna, with lemon cream and pine nuts in a cookie crust.",0,0
1632,Kingston 11,Caribbean,2,"Thanks to this lively Jamaican pop-up gone permanent, authentic island flavors have arrived in uptown Oakland. Its environs remain a bit dicey, but once inside, the smiling servers, boisterous crowds of families and friends, and reggae beats will transport you to the Caribbean-with a dose of California-chic from the modern interior design. Boldly flavored fare includes tender, smoky jerk chicken with an intense and peppery spice rub, and a milder (but wildly delicious) curried goat stew with potato, carrots, and onion. Crisp and flaky salt-fish fritters are mouthwateringly delicious, and ideal for dunking in an herbaceous chimichurri. Skip the forgettable desserts and save your calories for a refreshing rum cocktail from the Fern Gully bar.",0,0
1633,Buckeye Roadhouse,American,2,"This Marin hideout has welcomed generations of locals through its doors since 1937, even as its location on Highway 1 gave way to the more bustling 101. Enter the whitewashed craftsman building, and you'll be given your choice of dining in either the clubby bar or their grand dining room (complete with wood-paneled walls, red leather banquettes, and a tall fireplace). The food here is classical but never dull, with a simple menu of salads, sandwiches, barbecue, and meat from the wood grill. A brunchtime meal of eggs Benedict boasts tender rosemary ham and rich potato croquettes, while plump asparagus ravioli with lemon olive oil stars in the evening. Finish up with a slice of pie-the famous s'mores version or a tart Key lime are both winners.",0,0
1634,Flavas Jamaican Grill,Caribbean,1,"South San Francisco has never been a restaurant hot spot, but this rookie could be a sign of things to come. The secret is already out with local residents and Genentech employees, who fill the casual space for its good food, gracious service, and soundtrack of reggae beats. Flavas is simply decorated with basic furnishings and ocean-themed art, but its appeal is right there in the name. Authentic dishes brim with herbs, garlic, and Scotch Bonnet peppers, like the smoky, boldly spiced jerk chicken with caramelized fried plantains; or the fork-tender curried goat stew with coconut milk and chilies. Don't forget to keep an eye out for the intriguing daily specials, which can include jerk shrimp and snapper, saltfish and ackee, and other island favorites.",0,0
1635,Hawker Fare,Asian,1,"Those hawker stalls across Southeast Asia may not qualify as trendy, but here in uptown Oakland, hipsters in oversized eyeglasses and skinny jeans clamor for humble and tasty (if toned-down) street food. Groups of hard-drinking twenty- and thirty-something's are everywhere at Hawker Fare, sharing plates, perusing the faux-graffiti on the walls, and bobbing their heads to the beat of their own soundtrack. They come for well-made Thai like arugula salad with lotus root, jicama, and Chinese sausage; or spicy gang dang tofu curry with pumpkin over steamed rice. Indeed, rice is everywhere on the menu, from lunchtime bowl combos to a coconut pudding with banana jam and sesame-a treat that merits the long waits.A second location in the Mission is equally popular.",0,0
1636,alaMar,Seafood,2,"While alaMar does a steady business serving sandwiches and salads to downtown Oakland office workers, the food-savvy prefer to dine here at night, when the menu flips to a memorable array of seafood dishes-many offered by the pound in low-country boil style. Golden-brown blue crab poppers boast a punchy anchovy-piquillo aïoli, while a boil of fresh local crawfish is studded with house-made sausage, corn on the cob, and spring garlic. The space, with aqua-painted walls and rope elements, is tastefully nautical and designed to cater to guests' comfort as they peel apart dinner-there are towels on the tables and a special hand-washing sink. Bring a group to shoot the breeze as you work; then split some beignets with caramel-mocha sauce as a reward.",0,0
1637,Frantoio,Italian,2,"Named after the olive press used in olive oil production throughout Italy, Frantoio is distinguished by its own house-made olive oil, cold-pressed in a hefty granite contraption displayed just off the dining room. Bottled and sold on-site, this stellar product beams atop shavings of Prosciutto di Parma with arugula and mozzarella di Bufala. Baked sea bass fillets are spread with an herbaceous horseradish crust-big on flavor but gentle on garnishes like chive-infused olive oil. Though its proximity to Highway 101 and roadside hotels isn't pleasant, an orange-and-charcoal color scheme and lofty ceilings ensure that the surrounds become a quickly fading memory. Also of assistance: perfectly crisp Neapolitan pizzas, quenched by some fine wines.",0,0
1638,Iyasare,Japanese,2,"Japanese technique and Californian ingredients blend harmoniously at this charming Berkeley getaway, which flaunts a buzzing dining room and a delightful (heated) patio. Start the evening off right with an excellent (and reasonably-priced) local wine on tap or a selection from the well-edited sake list. Then, order a variety of their exquisite small plates for sharing. Every dish is a carefully crafted delight for the senses. Baby kale and mustard greens might not sound very Japanese, but they blend beautifully in a salad with Fuji apple and a sesame-miso dressing. The superb hamachi crudo is dusted with a sprinkle of wasabi snow and lemon-tamari oil, while fresh Manila clams arrive in an aromatic broth of sake, bacon, potatoes, and earthy shiitakes.",0,0
1639,Zut Tavern,Mediterranean,2,"Berkeley's beloved bistro is better than ever thanks to Chef Shotaro Kamio of Iyasare (just a few steps away) who has taken over and instilled a brand-new energy. Comfortable, inviting, and ever-popular, Zut Tavern features a skylight-brightened dining room enhanced with colorful artwork, front doors that open onto the patio, and waiting patrons spilling out onto busy Fourth Street. One thing that hasn't changed, however, is the enticing spirit of the Mediterranean-meets-American menu. Diners here dig into plates of mouthwatering fare like panzanella with burrata, aged balsamic, chunks of melon, and heirloom tomatoes; or sweet basil and pine nut pesto-slicked rigatoni tossed with Romano beans and tender slices of fingerling potatoes.",0,0
1640,Tacubaya,Mexican,1,"Megapopular Oakland Mexican restaurant Doña Tomas is reincarnated in taqueria form at this Berkeley shopping complex, where families grab a bite before or after errands. A line of people extends out the door from morning until night, ordering tangy limeade at the counter and claiming seats in the festive pink-and-orange dining room or on the sunny front patio. The crowds come for chilaquiles and churros at breakfast, then transition into flavorful chorizo-and-potato sopes with black bean purée at lunch. Moist, well-seasoned beef enchiladas are doused in a smoky, tangy guajillo-tomatillo sauce and covered with melted cheese. For a sweet finish, tamales filled with cranberry jam and drizzled with goat-milk caramel are both beguiling and unusual.",0,0
1641,Longbranch Saloon,Gastropub,2,"The wonders of whiskey are on full display at this relatively recent gastropub, which stocks a sizable selection of Bourbon, Scotch, and rye. If you're new to the brown elixir, never fear: well-chosen tasting flights will help you gain proficiency, and the laid-back crew of locals is engaging, never snobby. The kitchen's signatures are worthy of the bar's spirits selection, which explains why the space fills quickly with a local crowd. Order up a cocktail and half-dozen Tomales Bay oysters with mignonette. Then tuck into the hearty bangers and mash featuring a juicy house-made white sausage and buttery potato purée. Lighter appetites will love the asparagus sformato, a custardy, savory pudding accompanied by a tangy fennel salad with pickled grapes.",0,0
1642,Sahn Maru,Korean,2,"As one of East Bay's top Korean restaurants, Sahn Maru's name (which translates as ""top of the mountain"") is perfectly fitting. Its casual vibe, large size, and friendly service make it a good choice for groups. Never mind the wainscoting and country-quaint chairs that juxtapose walls covered with pictures of Korean dishes-this is a place for authentic food. Meals start with barley tea and tasty banchan like daikon kimchi, bean sprout salad in sesame oil, and fish cakes, alongside a bowl of delicately flavored kelp and daikon soup. Lunchtime might feature a deliciously unexpected combination of beef bulgogi stir-fried with jap chae. While the spot earns raves for Korean barbecue, the kitchen prepares it for you, as there are no tabletop grills.",0,0
1643,Grand Avenue Thai,Thai,1,"Thanks to its charming décor, friendly service, and flavorful cuisine, Grand Avenue Thai is a winning standout-just one block from picturesque Lake Merritt. The space is small with bright walls, fresh flowers, and colorful local artwork. Service is prompt even with a steady to-go business. Be sure to try one of the house favorites like the sweet and fragrant coconut curry with chunks of pumpkin, eggplant, broccoli, and string beans. Summer rolls neatly wrap up fresh veggies and garlicky rice noodles for a dip in peanut-chili sauce, while the ever-popular pad Thai combines plump prawns stir-fried with egg, bean sprouts, scallions, and peanuts in a tasty tamarind-Thai fish sauce. Spice can be tame, but the kitchen is happy to indulge the fire fiends.",0,0
1644,Trabocco,Italian,3,"Big-city style and rustic Italian authenticity combine to create magic at this Alameda favorite, which is owned by a native of Abruzzo. Its location in a shopping center isn't the greatest, but the sleek and sophisticated dining room and spacious front patio are transporting enough that you won't mind. Also of assistance: killer cocktails starring Alameda craft distiller St. George Spirits. The hearty food is a true taste of Italy, with lovingly hand-made dishes like chitarrine pasta swirled with a tender, tomato-flecked rabbit ragù. The massive wood-grilled pork chop is smoky, juicy, and accompanied by tender-crisp broccoli rabe. And for dessert, an airy zabaglione, delicately infused with a hint of Marsala, is served with fresh strawberries.",0,0
1645,Cholita Linda,Latin American,1,"The old Bay Area saw of farm-to-table gets a tasty spin at this purveyor of Latin fare, which transformed from a megapopular farmer's market stand into a packed house of communal tables. Bright, colorfully decorated, and flooded with natural light, it's a casual space where diners order and pay at the counter, then sip drinks from glass Mason jars under the potted palms. The outstanding Baja fish tacos are the source of Cholita Linda's reputation, but its dishes traverse Latin America, from a hearty Cubano to a plate of slow-braised, well-seasoned carnitas with black beans and fried plantains. With such reasonable prices, there's no excuse not to order a sweet, smooth mango agua fresca to wash down the tender, tangy pollo al pastor tacos.",0,0
1646,Ohgane,Korean,1,"Ohgane still beats out the local Korean competition thanks to its delicious food, contemporary dining rooms, and private parking lot (huge bonus in this area!). Business crowds appreciate the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet. Meals here start with an assortment of banchan-sixteen small bites including spicy kimchi, glazed sweet yam, and mild egg cake. Other kitchen-prepared dishes include mandoo and dolsot bibimbap. At night, Korean families gather beneath the ventilation hoods for tabletop mesquite grilling (soot-bool)-a specialty that is absolutely the way to go for dinner. During lunch, have the kitchen grill it for you and still enjoy the likes of smoky and tender galbee-beef short ribs marinated for 72 hours in garlic, soy, and sesame oil.",0,0
1647,Pizzaiolo,Pizza,2,"Lines are still a given at Temescal's pizza palace. In fact, find eager patrons arriving before the doors even open. A smattering of entrées and hearty plates like king salmon baked on a fig leaf with asparagus and mint yogurt evoke spring on a plate. But, crowds are here for their pies, crisp from the wood-burning oven and topped with the finest and freshest of ingredients like tangy tomato sauce, house-made sausage, and decadent panna. The large dining room with handsome plank floors and dark wood tables centers around the exhibition kitchen lined with bowls of pristine local produce. Couples and groups gather at tables or pack the polished wood bar. Add on a rich caramel pot de crème and the endless queues will start to make sense.",0,0
1648,Doña Tomás,Mexican,2,"Californian ingredients and Mexican flavors combine to create magic at this Temescal neighborhood standby, where regulars pour in at happy hour to chat with their favorite bartenders, and families savor warm Oakland nights on the spacious patio. In fact, Doña (and Berkeley sibling Tacubaya) is enough of a draw that you'll regret not making reservations, particularly on weekends. Hearty but never heavy, meals here commence with fresh-fried chips and appetizers like a butternut squash quesadilla packed with caramelized onions, corn, and poblano chile. Delightfully smoky mole negro stars in the shredded chicken enchiladas, served with braised kale and black beans. For dessert, a traditional tres leches is light as air-and heavy on flavor.",0,0
1649,Sidebar,Gastropub,2,"A loyal crowd of regulars flocks to this lively Oakland gastropub, located right across Grand Avenue from Lake Merritt. Though it offers only a handful of tables, Sidebar makes eating at the spacious rectangular bar a delight, with attentive servers and a view of the action in the semi-open kitchen. The cuisine is hearty and varied with starters like a chopped romaine salad with fennel salami and creamy garlic-herb dressing; braised chicken thighs with curried coconut-lime cream; and deviled eggs with smoky bacon and cheddar. Themed evenings include Mussel Madness Mondays and Goat Cheese Soufflé Wednesdays, but there's no shame in sticking to the excellent Niman Ranch burger, with house-pickled onions and chipotle-Thousand Island dressing.",0,0
1650,Commis,Contemporary,4,"Chef/owner James Syhabout may be keeping busy outside of Commis at his other popular restaurants, but this sparse Oakland original is still turning out elegant and creatively complex seasonal dishes to a packed house every night. Tucked into colorful, boutique-strewn Piedmont Avenue, this dining space is a long, clean, minimalist number with a smattering of tables up front; intimate banquette seating in the back; and a lively counter overlooking the humming kitchen. Soft hip-hop music and a vibrant service staff set the mood-cool and contemporary; relaxed but serious. In the kitchen, Chef Syhabout pairs well-sourced, local ingredients with precise technique to create his sophisticated nightly tasting, which continues to be exciting even for jaded gourmands. Dinner might unveil a plate of silky scallops paired with tangy crème fraîche, poached asparagus, and charred lemon granité; warm, roasted abalone with artichoke heart, fried artichoke slivers, and chicken sabayon; or a chilled fava bean soup laced with tarragon-infused crème fraîche, green tomato gelée, and smoked trout roe. A perfectly poached halibut confit with spring pea ""porridge"" and ginger foam is another beautifully composed plate that reflects the kitchen's attention to detail.",2,1
1651,Café Romanat,Ethiopian,1,"In a stretch of Oakland that teems with Ethiopian restaurants, Romanat is a standout, thanks to deliciously spiced dishes served in generous portions. Locals (including some Ethiopian families) fill the small room, set with traditional low stools and woven tables and featuring colorful fabric curtains and artwork. Order up an Ethiopian beer, honey wine, or a nutty ground flax or sesame seed juice to pair with the sambussas, triangular pastries stuffed with piquant, chile-flecked ground beef. All the combo platters, served on spongy, slightly sour injera, are perfect for sharing. And the veggie combo, with dishes like sautéed collard greens, lentils in smoky berbere, and split peas with turmeric and ginger, will delight any crowd.",0,0
1652,Homestead,American,2,"If it wasn't housed in a beautiful Julia Morgan-designed building, this farm-to-table jewel would be defined by the enticing smells that engulf you upon entrance. It's a rustic space, full of large windows peering onto Piedmont Avenue, and the jars of dry ingredients, pickling vegetables, and Julia Child cookbooks on the counter create an upscale country-kitchen vibe. The menu focuses on the best and freshest of local produce such as a panzanella with shaved carrot and crunchy asparagus. Braised octopus with Marcona almonds is light and fresh, allowing room for the star of the show: incredible wood-roasted pork, tender and moist, with potato gratin alongside. For a bright breakfast, look no further than the house-baked pastries and quiche.",0,0
1653,Mama Papa Lithuania,Eastern European,2,"Even highly avid diners may be unacquainted with Lithuanian food, but they won't be for long if this Alameda charmer-reputed to be the only one of its kind on the West Coast-is any indication. With exceptionally hospitable service and a cozy, brick-walled room full of rustic wooden tables, it's the next best thing to a home-cooked meal in Vilnius. Lithuania's iconic dumpling dish, cepelinai, is a must for newbies: the potato dough, filled with pork, caramelized onion, and a little cinnamon, is rib-stickingly rich. Refresh your palate with a cooling summer borscht, creamy with beets and yogurt; then go for broke with the meaty, yet delicate stuffed cabbage. Try and leave room for dessert, as the sweet cherry dumplings with sour cream are to die for.",0,0
1654,Boot and Shoe Service,Pizza,2,"Named for its former incarnation as a shoe-repair shop, this very accommodating Grand Avenue standby brings stellar pizzas and a totally relaxed vibe to its hungry neighborhood. The light, bright space suits every configuration, from the solo dining counter to gregarious communal tables and a semi-private room for large groups. Adept servers cater to the whims of hipsters and families alike. Dig into blistered Californian pies like wild nettle and ricotta salata; or try bacon, Calabrian chili, and cream. Other menu offerings should also be explored, especially the chili-inflected heirloom bean ragù with a velvety soft-cooked egg, smoky from the wood-fired oven. Healthier options feature a nutty farro salad with tender marinated beets and fresh herbs.",0,0
1655,Michel Bistro,French,2,"A slice of France on a prime block of Lakeshore Avenue, this bistro boasts a heavily Gallic waitstaff and clientele chatting away in their native tongue. With its exposed brick, soaring ceilings, and cute touches like an excerpt from a Marcel Pagnol play inscribed on the wall, it's a simple but pleasant spot to enjoy a delicious, low-key meal. The food is authentic, with some modern touches like the green almonds in a trout amandine with Lyonnaise-style potato salad, or the bison in a tartare with a quail egg. Brunch is a highlight with a gourmet eggs Benedict over artisan levain and butter-basted asparagus that steals the show. At either meal, the vanilla crème brûlée is a rich treasure-too often jumbled on other menus, it's perfectly rendered here.",0,0
1656,Shakewell,Mediterranean,2,"This trendy eatery, the brainchild of Top Chef alums Jennifer Biesty and Tim Nugent, was made for sipping and supping. Donning a bar up front and several dining nooks on either side of a central walkway, Shakewell keeps things Medi-chic with Moorish accents, reclaimed wood, and organic elements. Service is particularly warm, and an even warmer teal-green wood-fired oven in the back turns out deliciously smoked items like crisp falafel topped with chorizo aïoli. A summer squash salad with heirloom tomatoes, fried bread, and feta offers an inspired blend of Greek and Tuscan flavors, and Bomba rice with braised fennel, piperade, chicken, and prawns is a fluffy take on paella. For a party in your mouth, finish with the caramel syrup-spiked flan Catalan.",0,0
1657,Camino,Californian,2,"With its look of a medieval refectory and that central wood-burning hearth, Camino can seem like a trip to the days of yore-but the cool crowd, fun cocktails, and innovative food are decidedly modern. Take a seat under wrought-iron chandeliers at one of the long, communal tables (one of them is cut from a single redwood tree!) and expect to make some new friends. Chef-owner Russell Moore worked at Chez Panisse for many years, and his food is appropriately hyper-seasonal. An egg baked in the wood oven, its yolk still creamy, is nestled in leeks, herbs, and cream, while slices of char-grilled sourdough provide the base for a sandwich of juicy pancetta and rustic sauerkraut. Moist, sticky Lardy cake is also grilled, and topped with rich ricotta and honey.",0,0
1658,Los Cilantros,Mexican,1,"If there's no Mexican grandma in your life, Los Cilantros will show you what you've been missing: homey, authentic south-of-the-border fare (and if there is, it might just give her a run for her money). Whether you're biting into a crunchy tostada topped with chipotle chicken, black beans, sour cream, and avocado, or savoring rustic chicken enchiladas in a tangy green chile-tomatillo salsa, this is comfort food at its best. Cute and simple, the Berkeley newbie features tiled floors, pops of yellow and orange, and colorful paintings by Mexican artists. Settle in at one of the wooden tables and let the gracious staff make you feel right at home, or, if the weather's nice, grab a seat on the tiny front patio and catch some rays.",0,0
1659,Infinite Thai Eatery,Thai,1,"Infinitely warm service is the hallmark of this engaging Thai newcomer, where the attentive owner checks in on each customer to ensure they're enjoying their meal (an easy task, as the food is fresh, fragrant, and prepared with top-notch ingredients). And, if you like things spicy don't worry-western palates aren't shortchanged here. Kick things off with a classic larb gai, a cool salad of ground chicken mixed with lots of herbs and sliced shallots in a zippy lime dressing. Then turn up the temperature with the drunken rice noodles, packed with chicken and crisp vegetables in a fiery red chili-garlic sauce. If there's still room, opt for moo yang, grilled marinated pork boasting a rich smokiness and a tangy lime-chili dipping sauce.",0,0
1660,Café Colucci,Ethiopian,1,"On a stretch of Telegraph that's something of an Ethiopian restaurant row, Colucci stands out for its eye-catching décor, including a plant-laden terrace, fabric-draped ceiling, and selection of African art. As with all Ethiopian restaurants, bring clean hands and leave your fork at home: you'll be dining exclusively with injera, the spongy-sour bread that's traditional to the country. The menu offers many appealing options to scoop, from mild begue tibs (lamb with onions, garlic, and rosemary), to spicy eggplant wot stewed in a piquant berbere sauce. Fried potato slices called dentich tibs are great on their own, but extra tasty when paired with assa tibs, a whole baked fish. Save room for a buttery pistachio baklava and house-roasted Ethiopian coffee.",0,0
1661,Taqueria San Bruno,Mexican,1,"If you're willing to forgive its divey, industrial location in San Bruno's auto-repair corridor, this taqueria will reward you with flavor-packed food that's worthy of the largely Mexican clientele that congregates here at lunchtime. Expect to sit elbow-to-elbow with them at communal tables, where options range from authentically Mexican to delightfully Americanized (hello, hefty super burritos). Every type of taco served here is perfection-from fresh, plump marinated shrimp to sweet, caramelized al pastor. The superior chicken enchiladas sub smoky grilled chicken for the traditional boiled variety, then get added zest from a garlicky red chile sauce. Throw in warm, well-salted tortilla chips and piquant salsa, and you'll be a happy camper.",0,0
1662,High Peaks Kitchen,Indian,2,"The Himalayan-inspired name and Dalai Lama headshot might have you guessing correctly that this retreat is owned by Tibetans, but there's a twist: they were raised in India, and South Asian cooking is their specialty. The simple space, with its bright colors, small open kitchen, and inviting patio, is a cheerful setting for enjoying the delicious, affordable food. A range of well-spiced dishes boast layers of aroma and flavor, from the whole cardamom, shredded ginger, and star anise in a fiery potato vindaloo, to the potent yellow curry in a stewed chicken jalfrezi. The clientele is largely Indian, a testament to the kitchen's authenticity, and they can be found filling up on potato-stuffed naan with toasted coriander and cumin as well as smoky, moist ground lamb kebabs with mint chutney.",0,0
1663,Hamro Aangan,Nepali,1,"Nepali restaurants have proliferated in the East Bay of late, but Hamro Aangan remains at the top of the heap thanks to its rustic, flavorful, generously portioned dishes. The handmade momos (steamed dumplings filled with spiced cabbage, carrot, and onion) are accompanied by a garlicky curry sauce, while the fluffy, layered chicken biryani is rich with caramelized onions and ground cardamom. Goat stew with tomato and an intensely-spiced gravy is another delicious option. Located on busy San Pablo Avenue, Hamro is low-key, with red, rose, and copper décor and a beautiful mural from a local Nepali artist on the wall. It attracts a steady stream of regulars, particularly families, making it an excellent choice for a casual meal with kids in tow.",0,0
1664,À Côté,Mediterranean,2,"A long-running small-plates icon set within the posh stores of Rockridge, À Côté nearly always requires a wait-only a handful of seats are available for reservations. But, after settling into a cozy wood table or perhaps at the granite bar, a lively, very communal vibe will ease any irritation. Forty-plus wines offered by the glass augment the appeal. The seasonal menu has a French affect, discernable in plump fava bean falafel set atop tart tahini and pickled turnips; or green-garlic soup with a fromage blanc crouton. Entrées like seared yellowtail Jack brightened with asparagus, spring onion, and a Meyer lemon-blood orange relish perk up the palate; while a wood-fired oven and heated patio provide comforting warmth for indoor and outdoor meals.",0,0
1665,Oliveto,Italian,3,"Its memorable location in a prime corner of Rockridge is only the first hint of Oliveto's good looks: diners enter through a delightful mini-market and café-selling everything from pasta to Maine lobster-before climbing the spiral staircase into this elegant dining room, where a huge wood-burning oven, linen-topped tables, and bunches of fresh flowers delight the eye. Nothing about Oliveto screams ""Italian,"" from the décor to the all-American staff; yet its menu is completely authentic. Crisp, pan-roasted chicken breast rests on juicy herbed barley and asparagus, while charred Brussels sprouts get a kick from sweet saba and chopped walnuts. Barbaresco and Barolo, perfect with the strong selection of pastas and roasted meats, dominate the wine list.",0,0
1666,Pathos,Greek,2,"Forget the flaming saganaki and cries of ""Opa!""; Pathos is a sophisticated newcomer that will dispel any tired conceptions of Greek food. You'll want to dress up and bring a date to match its stylish décor, all hammered copper bar, oversized framed windows, and patterned banquettes. Most dishes come straight from the wood-fired oven, including a lighter take on moussaka, with nutmeg-infused Greek yogurt béchamel baked over ground beef and eggplant; or a roasted red bell pepper stuffed with ground beef and rice. The htapodi, tenderly grilled octopus over shaved red onion and fried capers, is another hit for its full, smoky flavor. Turn to the friendly staff for help in selecting from among the many Greek wines, or try an ouzo or metaxa cocktail.",0,0
1667,Ramen Shop,Japanese,2,"The ramen is non-traditional and the staff non-Japanese at this hip Oakland noodle joint, but that doesn't keep an onslaught of young locals from flooding in for a California-style take on Japan's iconic dish. Chewy, springy noodles and fresh vegetables like maitake mushrooms and tomato confit fill each bowl, with a choice of rich, savory pork or veggie Meyer lemon broths. With only three rotating ramens on the menu, appetizers actually make up most of the offering, and boy, they're killer-a shaved summer squash salad with creamy avocado and fried squash blossoms is to die for. The fun hipster vibe and delicious cocktails at the bar ensure this no-reservations spot fills up fast, so be sure to arrive early-or steel yourself for an inevitable wait.",0,0
1668,Millennium,Vegan,2,"After more than 20 years in San Francisco, this vegan paradise recently relocated to Oakland, where it's continuing to put out some of the most unique, delicious plant-based cuisine in the country. The rustic-chic new space is laid-back and unfussy, with lots of dark wood, a patio for alfresco dining, and a crowd of young families and professionals attended by welcoming servers. While dedicated vegans are sure to swoon, even hardcore carnivores might reconsider the lifestyle after a dose of Chef/owner Eric Tucker's culinary creativity, showcased best on a five-course ""Taste of Millennium"" menu. Spicy sopes with a smoked eggplant picadillo and pumpkin seed cream are knockouts, as is the take on a Thai larb salad made with ripe red plums.",0,0
1669,FIVE,American,2,"Right off Berkeley's main drag, this pre-cinema and pre-theater favorite in the historic Hotel Shattuck Plaza boasts a seriously impressive dining room, with airy high ceilings, dramatic pillars, and a gorgeous statement chandelier. Locals and hotel guests seem to be equally in love with its large front bar. Fine dining it isn't, but FIVE has become a favorite for approachable American food-including items designed for Berkeley's sizable vegetarian crowd. A golden beet salad is a cornucopia of Californian ingredients including fresh ricotta, tomato, and cucumber, while the juicy, delicious house-ground burger is accompanied by addictive parmesan fries. For dessert, persimmon sorbet gives a burst of freshness to dense, intense chocolate lava cake.",0,0
1670,Osmanthus,Asian,2,"Chef-owner Julia Klein has brought her cooking experience at Napa's Terra to bear on this ""modern-classic Asian"" restaurant. Osmanthus offers some fun bites that recall the '80s heyday of Asian fusion (shrimp toast or ginger-soy tuna tartare with avocado, maybe?) and some with more current touches like the sriracha-honey glaze served atop superlative fried Brussels sprouts with bacon. Sichuan influences abound, but chili-hounds beware: the cooking is more about flavor than fire. Inside, the former Nan Yang space has been updated with a serene look and boasts a dark tiled floor, colorful paper lanterns, and colonial-style ceiling fans. Drinkers should sample the house cocktail, while teetotalers enjoy a Thai iced tea-in regular or crème brûlée form.",0,0
1671,Great China,Chinese,2,"Great China may have moved a block away following a catastrophic fire, but that hasn't dimmed its appeal. Chic enough for the style-savvy, cheap enough for Cal students, and authentic enough for local Chinese families, it's one of the few local restaurants everyone can-and does-agree on. Fresh and flavorful meat and produce set Great China's food apart. And while it's not super-spicy, it's also not reliant on chili oil and Sichuan peppercorns to mask low-quality ingredients. Bring a group and savor it all: tender and aromatic twice-cooked pork, piquant mapo tofu, beautifully lacquered tea-smoked duck with fluffy steamed buns, and tender-crisp ong choy (water spinach) with fermented tofu paste. Generous portions and ample seating seal this savory deal.",0,0
1672,Wood Tavern,Californian,2,"There's always a crowd at this lively neighborhood standby, where groups of friends, parents on date night, and hip couples congregate for drinks at the copper-topped bar. Flanked by organic groceries, indie bookstores, and antique shops, its surroundings reek of peace, weaving a pleasantly bohemian spell that captivates both regulars and newcomers alike. Rustic American food with a hint of Italian flair dominates the menu and the local Belfiore burrata-served atop diced pears, honey-cashew cream, and peppery arugula-is a surefire hit. Then pappardelle may arrive tangled in an intensely flavored veal ragù, enriched with spicy chili flakes and parmesan. For dessert, an apple-oatmeal crumble with sour cream ice cream is just the ticket.",0,0
1673,China Village,Chinese,1,"It takes a village to feed a big group, and this laid-back spot is a favorite with families. A stylish recent renovation has added a sleek front bar, contemporary chandeliers, and dramatic Chinese art, but one look at the scorching-hot menu options-think spicy Sichuan frog and flaky sautéed fish with pickled chili peppers-confirms the authenticity factor. Skip the Hunan, Mandarin, and Cantonese offerings in favor of the Sichuan specialties, like dry-fried, bone-in chicken laced with ground chili and numbing peppercorns. And be sure to order the five-spice hot and spicy pork shoulder. A house specialty, this mouthwatering dish is fork- (or chopstick) tender and rests atop a deliciously piquant chili-oil jus with baby bok choy, scallions, and garlic.",0,0
1674,Imm Thai Street Food,Thai,1,"While you won't actually be eating on the street, this bitty Berkeley spot isn't much more than a sidewalk stand with a handful of tables and counter seats. But what Imm lacks in glitz it more than makes up for in its bold, intensely spiced Thai cooking. Bring the gang for an insanely affordable spread: start with thin slices of kabocha squash, battered and deep-fried until tender and served with a sweet-sour dipping sauce, or a tangy green papaya salad with fresh shrimp and a spicy chili-lime vinaigrette. Creamy red coconut curry is loaded with zucchini, bell peppers, bamboo shoots, and cubes of fresh tofu. And, don't skip out before trying the suki, a Thai-style hot pot packed with beef, chicken, prawns, tofu, veggies, glass noodles, and plenty of herbs.",0,0
1675,Ippuku,Japanese,2,"Can't swing a ticket to Tokyo? Dinner at Ippuku is the next best thing. With its low Japanese-style tables, extensive woodwork, and enormous selection of sake and shochu, it feels like an authentic izakaya transplanted into a corner of downtown Berkeley. The low-profile entrance adds to the feeling you've lucked upon a special dining secret-assuming you don't stroll right past it, that is. Yakitori are the big draw here, with smoky, salty chicken thighs, necks, hearts, and gizzards arriving fresh off the binchotan. Other excellent small plates include korokke or golden-brown Dungeness crab croquettes, crisp on the outside and with a creamy interior, or yaki imo, caramelized white sweet potato with a sweet-and-salty glaze.",0,0
1676,Gather,Californian,2,"With its heavily vegetarian bill of fare, reclaimed and repurposed décor, and local Berkeley crowd, Gather is a must for mostly-meatless diners of all ages. This aptly-named hit offers a relaxed vibe for a light lunch, cocktails at the bar, dinner on the patio, and everything in between. Surprisingly hearty dishes like chicory salad tossed with sliced fennel and fines herbes vinaigrette won't leave you craving meat, nor will the gourmet Wagon Wheel grilled cheese with braised greens and chanterelle mushrooms. Dinner is more complex, with ambitious offerings like the vegan ""charcuterie,"" a platter of four delicious vegetable preparations. Should you venture into San Francisco City, be sure to visit its new-and already acclaimed-sister restaurant, Verbena.",0,0
1677,Comal,Mexican,2,"For bold, zesty Mexican food crafted with pristine ingredients, Berkeleyites throng this industrial-chic hot spot, where an excellent cocktail program and an extensive tequila plus mezcal selection keep things buzzing. The large flat tortilla griddles for which it's named are on full display in the open kitchen, while a covered, heated back patio draws locals for year-round outdoor dining. Comal's fryer-fresh warm tortilla chips, paired with perfect, creamy guacamole, are irresistible; summon an order as you peruse options like the refreshing white shrimp ceviche and earthy hen-of-the-woods mushroom quesadilla. Just make sure the smoky wood-grilled rock cod tacos, with creamy avocado aïoli and spicy cabbage slaw, are on your must-order list.",0,0
1678,Mount Everest,Nepali,1,"Lured by the wafting scents of spices just a few blocks south of UC Berkeley's campus, students, professors, and local corporate types flock to Mount Everest. The corner spot has plenty of light, cheery yellow walls, friendly service, and a relaxed atmosphere. Students appreciate the inexpensive thali at lunch, while overflow crowds settle on the balcony.The menu offers Indian cuisine, but specializes in traditional Nepali dishes like steamed momos filled with minced cabbage, carrot, and onion, with a deeply spiced dipping sauce of sesame, turmeric, and ginger. Channa masala boasts chickpeas seasoned with subtle Nepali spices; and the creamy tomato sauce in chicken tikka masala is infused with pungent aromatics. Both beg to be sopped up with naan and rice.",0,0
1679,Bistro Liaison,French,2,"This slice of Paris in Berkeley, just two blocks from campus, draws regulars with its authentic bistro vibe, complete with closely spaced tables and cheerful yellow walls displaying vintage French posters and artwork. On warm days, diners scramble to score one of the sidewalk tables, though the traffic on busy Shattuck Avenue might dispel any fantasies of the Champs-Élysées. The fare, like the décor, is classic French, with dishes like escargots in garlic butter and a croque monsieur oozing with Emmenthaler cheese. At dinner, hearty boeuf bourguignon and steamed mussels in garlic and white wine send diners into Gallic reveries. Finish with a buttery, flaky apple tarte Tatin, drowned in caramel and topped with a scoop of rum-raisin ice cream.",0,0
1680,Corso,Italian,2,"A Tuscan follow-up from the couple behind nearby Rivoli, Corso is every bit the equal of its big sister, thanks to generous, Florentine-inspired dishes like a roasted squid panzanella with torn flatbread, buttery white beans, and bright dashes of lemon juice and chili oil. Pasta fiends will swoon for house-made tagliatelle in a meaty beef and pork sugo, while butter-roasted chicken boasts juicy meat, golden-brown skin as well as fresh peas and asparagus alongside. Soul-warming in its hospitality, Corso is the kind of place where servers will bring complimentary pistachio biscotti simply because they're ""so good when they're warm."" It's no surprise that the tiny trattoria is a favorite among new couples, so be sure to reserve in advance and come hungry.",0,0
1681,Rivoli,Californian,2,"Northern Californian cooking with a trace of Italian flavor is the main draw at this lush charmer on the Albany-Berkeley border, serving up delectable and seasonal dishes. Rivoli is always popular and a winner among its patrons, who come here to savor undeniably excellent items like a crisp endive salad tossing peppery arugula, sweet plums, and blue cheese. Tender braised lamb-stuffed ravioli topped with tomato sauce, spiced chickpeas, and garlic-mint yogurt is another jewel. Set in an adorable cottage, the dining room also features enormous picture windows overlooking a lush ""secret"" garden blooming with tender fronds and climbing ivy. The greenery is a stunning contrast to the crisp, white-linen tables, smartly serviced by an engaging waitstaff.",0,0
1682,Chez Panisse,Californian,4,"For avid gourmets, Alice Waters' mecca of Californian cuisine needs no introduction. Housed in a beautiful Craftsman-style home, it's divided in two: the upstairs café offers more casual fare, while the elegant downstairs restaurant serves a nightly prix-fixe menu. Both spaces teem with copper light fixtures, displays of seasonal foliage, and vintage glassware. The restaurant prides itself on serving every ingredient at peak season, from the raspberries in a prosecco aperitif to the delicate Black Prince tomato that tops handmade roasted eggplant ravioli. Many dishes are cooked at the wood-fired hearth, like a delectably smoky pork loin with sweet corn and fried squash blossoms. This icon books up early; be sure to reserve a month in advance.",0,0
1683,Bangkok Jam,Thai,1,"Do not be deterred by the plain façade sandwiched amid retail stores. Inside, this long and narrow space is contemporary and stylish with glittering chandeliers, dark wood tables, and brick wainscoting. A sweet, attentive staff keeps things casual and kid-friendly. Whet the appetite with a plate of crispy vegetable spring rolls stuffed with carrots, cabbage, and onion, served with a tangy sweet and sour dipping sauce. Follow this with organic lemongrass chicken breast, tender and smoky, served over rice and complemented by a duo of spicy lime and sweet tamarind sauces. However, curries are the true standout here, with choices ranging from succulent pumpkin to sweet and spicy mango stewed in coconut red curry with cabbage, peas, carrots, bell peppers, and tofu.",0,0
1684,Bellanico,Italian,2,"Considering Bellanico is named for its owners' daughters, it's no surprise that this resto is a hit with families. The sibling of Potrero Hill's Aperto, it fills day and night with local couples (dining with or without their children), enjoying the cheery, persimmon-accented dining room, bustling open kitchen, and wall of windows overlooking Park Boulevard. Kick off a meal with kid-friendly antipasti like cauliflower fritters with garlic aglioli or fresh burrata with grilled bread. Then dig into a pasta like the tagliolini pepati, full of smoky bacon, chopped hot peppers, wilted arugula, chili, and garlic. The pan-roasted chicken breast is also a favorite for all ages, with tasty seasonal accompaniments like roasted sweet corn and toybox squash.",0,0
1685,Prabh,Indian,2,"Located in a converted house and a welcome addition to Mill Valley's dining scene, this casual yet stylish Indian restaurant is a cut above the rest. South Asian art and sculpture, fresh flowers, and copper accents add splashes of color to the mahogany furnishings and granite tabletops, while the glass-enclosed front porch is a sunny spot to enjoy an easygoing lunch, kids included. Bring a group and explore the menu family-style, as you won't want to miss the tender, well-spiced, and garam masala-redolent lamb rogan josh or the sizzling kebab of chicken tikka in its tangy, delectable yogurt marinade. Flaky samosas filled with a flavorful blend of potatoes, peas, caramelized onions, and served with a trio of tasty chutneys, are quite perfect.",0,0
1686,El Paseo,Steakhouse,3,"""Rockstar chef"" is a term that often gets tossed around, but it's all too true at this rustic steakhouse, co-owned by celebrity toque Tyler Florence and rocker Sammy Hagar. Hidden down an alley off the shopping arcade of Mill Valley, El Paseo reeks of old-world charm with rustic wood-beamed ceilings and brick walls. Adding a dose of romance are cool high-backed leather chairs warmed up by a live fireplace. Once seated, the tuxedoed staff will present a cast iron tray of roasted bone marrow topped with a mild horseradish crust and turnip marmalade. A Heritage pork chop is grilled to smoky perfection and coddled with pea purée; while the béarnaise burger makes for a primally satisfying meal, especially if paired with a Napa red from the cavernous cellar.",0,0
1687,Gintei,Japanese,1,"San Bruno's rep as a dining wasteland is due for a re-evaluation with the arrival of this sleek, stylish new sushi spot, whose offerings can hang with the best in San Francisco. Bright and contemporary, with dramatic pressed-tin ceilings and a coveted eight-seat sushi counter, it's already becoming known as a reservations-required must for omakase enthusiasts, with deeply hospitable service. Newbies to nigiri should make a beeline for the omakase, but the more experienced palate will revel in market specials like silky Hokkaido scallops, sweet and succulent live spot prawns (with the traditional deep-fried heads alongside), and firm yet tender octopus. Everything is minimally dressed-all, the better to accentuate the fish's outstanding quality.",0,0
1688,Molina,Californian,2,"Small and deeply personal, this Mill Valley destination is a showcase for Chef Todd Shoberg, who simultaneously mans the wood-fired oven and flips vinyl records that provide the soundtrack (and double as art). With a funky design full of wood and texture, it's almost like eating in the home of a friend-albeit one with great taste in music who really knows his way around the kitchen. The best of Marin produce stars on the ever-changing menu, which might include gold rice with prawns, pork belly, and a green tomato gazpacho; or tender, crisp-skinned game hen over a Waldorf-esque salad of romaine, blue cheese, walnuts, and Bing cherries. From the wine to the bread, everything is local, yet inventive and compelling: it's a gift both to and from the community.",0,0
1689,Bungalow 44,American,2,"Nestled amid the fancy stores of quaint Mill Valley, vibrant Bungalow 44 draws a varied crew to its casual, contemporary environs. It's always busy at the bustling bar and slightly more subdued dining room, so for some peace and quiet, retire to the tented outer room with its glowing fireplace. Some prefer the counter to soak up the sizzle from the open kitchen. Playful American cuisine is their dictum which shines through in tuna carpaccio-an homage to Italian antipasto-here starring tissue-thin slices of tuna served with citrusy mizuna and creamy mustard sauce. The whiff of cayenne from kickin' fried chicken is as tempting as the juicy meat-add the rich mashed potatoes. Local draft wines paired with pillowy-soft beignets make for a rewarding finish.",0,0
1690,Yi Yuan,Chinese,2,"Millbrae boasts no end of Chinese restaurants, but this fire-hot spot stands out for its tasty Sichuan-style dishes laden with chilies, peppercorns, and chili oil, as well as its attempts to bring some decorative polish to the oft-dumpy area landscape. Sure, the faux-pagoda ceilings and strings of red lanterns are a bit tacky, but the food is worth it. Try to score a table near the glass-enclosed kitchen, where you can watch a cook expertly hand-pull the chewy, thick noodles in your dan dan mien, a spicy blend of ground pork and chili paste. Fatty, rich smoked pork is sautéed with leeks, garlic, and plenty of spice, just as crispy, tongue-numbing Chongqing chicken arrives under a pile of still more peppers. If you like your food fiery, look no further.",0,0
1691,Burmatown,Burmese,2,"Bypass the tired Asian-fusion offerings and head straight for the authentic Burmese dishes at this out-of-the-way cutie. A nutty, crunchy, and flavorful tea-leaf salad is the perfect answer to a hot summer day, while hearty potato-stuffed samosas and fresh, springy egg noodles tossed with barbecue pork and fried garlic chips will warm your soul in the cooler months. Given the high quality of its food, it's no surprise that Burmatown is Corte Madera's most popular novel neighbor: it's big with local families from the surrounding residences, who pack every single table, attended to by warm servers. If you're willing to make a special trip to this charming bright-orange bungalow, the laid-back vibe will have you feeling right at home.",0,0
1692,Brick & Bottle,American,2,"Its strip-mall location may put you off the hunt, but Marin locals know that Brick & Bottle is one of the area's best for fuss-free, skillfully prepared American food that's packed with flavor. Grab a drink at the rollicking bar, complete with TVs for catching a game, then squeeze into a comfortable booth in the quieter back dining room. The wide-ranging and perfectly executed menu dazzles as readily with Italian fare (like fluffy, well-caramelized potato gnocchi in a pitch perfect pesto) as it does with barbecue (try the smoky, tender pork shoulder in a cider-based sauce with jalapeño slaw). For dessert, a moist, buttery rum cake-complete with caramel sauce, rum raisin ice cream, and toasted pecans-rivals the Caribbean's best.",0,0
1693,Happy Sichuan,Chinese,2,"The closure of several top Sichuan spots have saddened Peninsula diners in recent years, but newcomer Happy Sichuan is a worthy successor. Simply and minimally decorated, it won't win prizes for looks or surroundings (it's housed in a Millbrae strip mall), but servers are friendly and flavors appropriately bold. Skip the milquetoast Americanized dishes and head straight for the menu's ""Specialties"" section, where you'll encounter the absolutely enormous hot pot-a flavorful, rich broth full of beef, chicken, lamb, and soft tofu. The magic chicken earns its name thanks to a crisp, chili-inflected coating, and the spicy cold wheat noodles with cucumber are a delight. With fiery fare this good and plentiful, you're sure to leave, well, happy.",0,0
1694,Picco,Italian,2,"Picco is Italian for ""summit,"" and this charming Larkspur hilltop home has long been a beacon among Marin county diners. Chef/owner Bruce Hill is a true local-food devotee; his Italian-influenced fare heaps on Marin ingredients like the fresh turnips that dot his silky-smooth duck tortelli; or the Meyer lemon yogurt and beets that sit atop a nourishing kale salad. The three-course ""Marin Mondays"" menu is a particular steal. The precise staff moves ably through the busy dining room, carrying bowls of creamy risotto made on the half-hour. With a high ceiling and exposed brick walls, the vibe is graceful but never fussy, making this the perfect setting for couples and groups of friends who congregate here. Also check out Pizzeria Picco next door.",0,0

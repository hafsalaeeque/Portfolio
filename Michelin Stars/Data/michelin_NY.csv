0,Racines NY,Cuisine French,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Good standard.,"The American outpost of this popular Parisian original cuts an elegant figure, with its wide marble bar and pristine flower arrangements. Throw in romantic low lighting, brick-lined walls and a tony TriBeCa address-and you have quite the operation. The service can be a bit off-putting, which is a shame because Racines NY has an ace, even affordable, wine list that bears discussion and recommendations. As for the food, you'll pay for all that sexy ambience a little more than the cuisine currently merits-but certain dishes, like a rich chicken liver mousse served with grilled breads, make for an elegant bar snack. Paired with one of those excellent wines by the glass and a seat at that handsome bar, you have a recipe for a glam night on the town.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Racines_NY-442997-41102
1,Little Park,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Chef/owner Andrew Carmellini strikes again, this time with an inviting all-day eatery on the ground floor of the Smyth Hotel. White tiled walls, amazing artwork, and lovely fresh flowers ensure that the well-designed dining room feels cheery and comfortable. Generous space between tables promises privacy. Local and seasonal ingredients dictate the menu, especially in the raw and cured section-Long Island fluke or Peconic Bay scallops are simple, fresh opening acts. Purple and orange carrots are roasted until tender, topped in crisp breadcrumbs, then beautifully plated with a tangy black garlic aïoli. A burgundy-hued beetroot risotto is studded with goat cheese. Brimming with cuttlefish, clams, and mussels, the spiced shellfish ragù is downright outstanding.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10007-Little_Park-468095-41102
2,Blaue Gans,Cuisine Austrian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This sleek, unbridled Viennese-style café feels almost smoky and well-worn, but never out of touch. Its walls are papered with vintage movie posters, while banquettes and tables dominate the dining space. Blaue Gans' strong, loyal following (an increasingly rare feat in the city) is comprised of locals engaging in familiar banter at the bar or communal table. Everyone is here for the impressive Austrian cooking, which may unveil a beautiful bibb, pumpkin seed, and shaved radish salad with a light, creamy pumpkin oil dressing. Other classic treasures include pork Jäger schnitzel with mushrooms, bacon, and herbed spätzle; or classic kavalierspitz accompanied by salty creamed spinach and sweet-tart apple horseradish. Delish desserts will have you at hello.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Blaue_Gans-123614-41102
3,Rosanjin,Cuisine Japanese,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Very good standard.","From its ultra-discrete entrance to its heavily curtained windows, everything about this elegant TriBeCa Japanese restaurant spells delicious rendezvous. Should you be lucky enough to find your way into Rosanjin's barely marked entrance, you'll discover a sleek, sophisticated and oh-so-private dining room with soft jazz music that reads tranquil even when it's full. Despite its tony address and well-heeled clientele, Rosanjin retains a sort of bonhomie from another era-it's not uncommon for the chef to hand-deliver a few of your dishes with a heartfelt thank you. It's a gesture of gratitude you're likely to return after witnessing the stunning composition on your plate. A typical kaiseki meal here would feature a bright selection of sushi, some of it scored to deliver that perfect melt-in-your-mouth experience; and might include a delicate (and dramatic) starter of lobster and uni, suspended in a jellied dashi broth and served in a glass with a wispy cloud of orange dry ice. Then, an excellent chawan mushi may follow, with salty caviar, tender oyster mushrooms, fresh uni, and chives; or a delicious clear soup with a scallop mousse dumpling, mountain yam, mountain greens, and ginger.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Rosanjin-324022-41102
4,Brushstroke,Cuisine Japanese,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Very good standard. Our best addresses.","The name may not give too much away but as soon as you enter you just know you're in a Japanese restaurant. It's probably all that calming wood-there's enough here of assorted hues and from various sources to excite the woodsman in us all. Or it could be the L-shaped counter behind which chefs go about their work with studied determination; or more probably, it's the sight of graciously polite servers carrying bowls, boards, and cups containing delicate dishes of infinite beauty. This joint venture between David Bouley and Yoshiki Tsuji aims to showcase the beauty, subtlety, harmony, and precision that is Japanese cuisine. This isn't the place for sushi-you go next door for that. Instead, it serves seasonally pertinent dishes that are a joy to behold, but where the art never comes at the expense of taste. The Washu beef sukiyaki, for example, has a wonderful depth of flavor. Desserts, such as sake crème brûlée, have more obvious European parentage but are still light, delicate creations. Indeed, such is the nature of the food here that one can, unlike with many styles of restaurant, still engage in constructive work afterwards.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Brushstroke-335749-41102
5,Tiny's,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard. Our best addresses.,"The name says it all-Tiny's is indeed tiny, but in that old New York, wood-burning fire and pressed-tin ceiling kind of way. Enter the narrow Federal-style home (c. 1810) and sidle up to the beautiful people along the pew seats overlooking a poster of the Marlboro Man, or head on to the aptly named Bar Upstairs. The food may be American but seamlessly weaves in Italian influences. Creamy burrata arrives over date purée, glazed in lemon-honey and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Hake is thickly cut and enticingly flaky, drizzled in brown butter with tart capers, lemon, and parsley, then complemented with both pan-roasted fingerling potatoes and beautifully dressed frisée salad. Even their delicate California chardonnay harkens to old-world flavors.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Tiny_s-360778-41102
6,The Odeon,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"It's easy to see why The Odeon has been a part of the fabric of TriBeCa life for so long. Like watching a re-run of Seinfeld, it is reassuringly familiar, classically New York and, even when you know what's coming next, still eminently satisfying. The menu is a roll-call of everyone's favorites, from chicken paillard to beet salad, burgers to cheesecake. Cocktails are well made and beers carefully poured. Dishes are executed with sufficient care and portions are of manageable proportions. The room comes with an appealing art deco feel and the terrace at the front pulls in the occasional passer-by. Service is personable and willing too, although after all this time the place could probably run itself.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-The_Odeon-70630-41102
7,Marc Forgione,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"This eponymous restaurant is dark, sexy, and attracts an endless stream of downtown denizens. Abundant candles produce more atmosphere than light for the rustic room clad in exposed brick and salvaged wood. Aloof servers dressed in black seem to disappear into the background. The innovative American fare excites with bold flavors, as in barbecued oysters sprinkled with pancetta powder. Montauk fluke en croute, set over roasted cauliflower, hazelnuts, and capers topped with a buttery panel of toast, is dressed with sauce proposal-so named because the rich brown butter and golden raisin emulsion is said to have earned the chef a few romantic offers. It is delicious, but Chef Forgione deserves equal affection for those amazing butter-glazed potato rolls.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Marc_Forgione-253724-41102
8,atera,Cuisine Contemporary,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"Two MICHELIN stars: exceptional cuisine. Worth a detour! 





Good standard. Our best addresses.","Well, hello there, Ronny Emborg-this visionary new culinary talent takes the reigns at Jodi Richard's sleek TriBeCa tasting menu restaurant, atera-and the results are nothing short of sublime. Guests access atera by an ultra-discreet entrance; from there, a polished and attentive staff member might offer you a complimentary drink before whisking you off to a lovely, U-shaped counter with supple leather seats positioned to watch the kitchen execute its magic. Sound like a beautiful dream? It is wonderfully real, and that's before they ply you with their excellent wine pairing, cocktails or tea tasting (yes, tea-trust us, you'll be talking about it for days). Chef Emborg's Danish-accented menu might begin with an exquisite chilled green tomato soup with juniper oil, before proceeding to a buttery waffle with savory mushroom cream and earthy black truffle. Then, tender snow crab in an ethereal tomato broth with rose hip cream; or sweet scallop with crisp green apple, dill fronds and horseradish ice may be tailed by springy sepia plated with tart currants and laced with a deadly delicious hazelnut fish cream. Plump razor clams in a miso-brown butter broth are topped with bitter greens and foam for added flavor.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-atera-366502-41102
9,Ichimura,Cuisine Japanese,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"Two MICHELIN stars: exceptional cuisine. Worth a detour! 





Good standard.","Tucked away in the bustling swirl of TriBeCa, Ichimura is an oasis of tranquility-with a bright, sun-drenched wood décor that effortlessly blends minimalist Japanese style with a modern sensibility. It's the perfect space to take a seat at the L-shaped counter, take a deep breath, and let go of that city angst. Then, give yourself over completely to the genius Chef Eiji Ichimura and his talented waitstaff. Throughout your omakase experience, Chef Ichimura always handles the service himself-first bending over his heart-stopping creations and shaping dishes with fingers as nimble as a cellist's, then delivering it with a gracious smile. Dinner might begin with the traditional zensai, or appetizer plate of cold bites; and then move on to dishes like a warm, excellent chawan mushi topped with Florida golden crab, truffle dashi, and confetti of chopped chives. A plate of superbly fresh and seasonal sashimi, some of it expertly cured or carrying a drop of delicious sauce, may be tailed by a mind-blowing parade of bright sushi that might include hiramasa, king mackerel, Japanese ocean trout, Flying fish, sea perch, or the creamiest ebi you've ever tasted, carrying a whisper of shiso and Japanese uni.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Ichimura-405984-41102
10,Khe-Yo,Cuisine Asian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","This Laotian hot spot serves up vibrant family-style plates brimming with tart and spicy notes that pack a punch-make that a Bang Bang, actually, as in the house sauce of mixed chilies, cilantro, fish sauce, and garlic served to diners as a welcome along with a basket of sticky rice. The food is worth braving the wait and decibel levels, so sip a craft brew or cocktail before digging in. Start with a plate of wide rice noodles and bits of slow-cooked pork in a coconut-rich yellow curry garnished with herbs, bean sprouts, and slivered banana blossom. Banana leaf-steamed red snapper is another beautifully prepared item, served with crisped artichoke hearts, Chinese broccoli, and more of that sauce. Bright and bitter grapefruit sorbet is a fitting finish.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Khe_Yo-435418-41102
11,Bouley,Cuisine French,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Excellent standard. Our best addresses.","Even from the outside, Bouley hints at the certain level of luxury that every successful TriBeCa restaurant strives to attain. Here, it begins with an industrial façade, high arches, exposed brick, and oversized windows dressed in silk. Inside, hand-painted wallpaper, bold watercolors, and a generous floral budget make for an operatic setting reminiscent of a château-maybe the same one from which they salvaged the floors (literally). An undeniable formality keeps the varied clientele muted but never hushed. The ambience may seem a bit old school, yet the cooking mixes tradition with modernity. Meals may start with a fresh, earthy mix of wild mushrooms with sweet garlic, subtle seasoning, and grilled toro that brings unexpected dimension to the dish. Slightly smoky Alaskan salmon with corn sauce and hearts of palm is almost overshadowed by the superlative pomme purée that is buttery yet retains its pronounced potato flavor. But, remember to pace yourself as Bouley pushes one of the most serious carb chariots in town-think death by bread. Finish with an amaretto flan piped with white chocolate, caramelized banana, and silky-smooth maple and amaretto ice cream. It's delicious and never disappoints.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Bouley-257532-41102
12,Landmarc,Cuisine Mediterranean,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Chef/owner Marc Murphy's Landmarc is the TriBeCa destination for meeting friends over casual drinks and food that happens to be rib-sticking delicious. Downstairs, the bi-level space showcases thick steel cables suspending industrial art and a horseshoe bar flanking a large cooking fire that warms the soul and sizzles those lamb chops. The upstairs is more serene. Meals may start with lighter plates of smoky and blistered shishito peppers flecked with crunchy sea salt. Then, move on to deeply satisfying (and reasonably priced) nightly pasta specials, like thick and buttery spaghetti alla Bolognese. ""Landmarc classic"" cheese plates are a reliable highlight. Miniature desserts mean that there is always room for a lemon-custard tart (or four).",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Landmarc-68515-41102
13,Zutto,Cuisine Asian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Exposed filament bulbs and a red brick wall give this cozy Japanese pub an inviting, industrial feel. There is a communal wood table for groups, small sushi bar, and long wall of banquettes and tables topped with linen napkins cleverly folded, origami-style. Service is eager, efficient, and less concerned with the flow of a leisurely meal. Unlike many Japanese restaurants with one specialty, this izakaya's diverse menu includes bar snacks, sushi, steamed buns, and ramen. Tangy, spicy buffalo cauliflower is a playful take on wings, replacing chicken with bright orange chunks of deep-fried cauliflower tempered by cool, creamy ranch sauce. The Zutto fried rice is another ideal drinking accompaniment, peppered with kimchi and pastrami beneath a runny egg.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Zutto-366504-41102
14,Jungsik,Cuisine Korean,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"Two MICHELIN stars: exceptional cuisine. Worth a detour! 





Very good standard.","Cool, chic, and completely urbane, Jungsik is the epitome of contemporary elegance. Inside the large, neatly partitioned space, find rich browns and ivory furnishings with flattering lighting that is just bright enough to see your food clearly. The chairs are deep and tables are well spaced, but request a plush corner banquette for maximum comfort. Even the place settings show sculptural beauty through dark pottery and white porcelain. The ambience is fairly quiet and somewhat reflective. The modern cuisine is confident, complex, and happens to be leaning much more toward Europe than Korea of late. No matter-the cooking remains profoundly enjoyable. At the same time, the most inspired dishes are the ones that retain their heritage, as in the dome of seaweed-seasoned rice with cubes of smoked and torched yellowtail, finished with slivered lettuce. Before the crispy red snapper arrives at the table, hot oil is poured overtop to cook the fish but also to yield incredibly crisped skin, served with a brunoise of hearty greens and potatoes and rich perilla vinaigrette. Artful desserts include black raspberry and coconut sorbet with crumbles of spinach cake, yuzu meringue, and perfect berry slices.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Jungsik-360775-41102
15,Tamarind,Cuisine Indian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"Building Tamarind cost a cool five million, and it shows-every inch of this soaring space oozes with grandeur. With its classic TriBeCa edifice and gorgeous marble bar (an ideal perch for post-work indulgence), the glass-fronted behemoth draws a posh crowd of Wall Streeters and well-heeled locals. Most impressive of all is the sleek display kitchen, outfitted with a gleaming tandoor that turns out exceptional Mughlai food like nawab shami kabab (lamb patties seasoned with ginger) and hara bhara kabab (pearl-white paneer mingled with bright emerald-green spinach). While service is mediocre at best and the kitchen may fall behind at peak times, mains like kolambi pola (prawns in a coconut-and-chili curry) make up for any gaffes and guarantee a return visit.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Tamarind-324024-41102
16,MarkJoseph,Cuisine Steakhouse,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"This smart and sleek steak haven continues to claim its rightful place among the faithful haunts of area residents, business types, and carnivores in town. Handsome in its dark wood-paneled glory, with a wine cellar display and white tablecloths, this traditional den exudes a clubby Wall Street scene. Expect to see a crowd of suits discussing stocks, shares, and sports scores, of course. The quality of USDA Prime beef is paramount here, but the culinary technique is just another reason why this steakhouse succeeds. Steaks are perfect medium rare, brushed with sweet melting fat, seasoned with salt, and perhaps served with a gravy boat of béarnaise sauce. Finish off with a classic slice of pecan pie topped with swirls of whipped cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10038-MarkJoseph-68156-41102
17,Bâtard,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Good standard.","239 West Broadway will be a familiar address to those who know their restaurants as it has hosted a number of seminal establishments over the years-namely Montrachet and Corton. Drew Nieporent's Bâtard restaurant is now firmly in situ and once again we have a talented chef making waves in TriBeCa. Chef Markus Glocker's cooking is very precise and his dishes look quite delicate on the plate. But like a good featherweight they pack more of a punch than you're expecting. You'll even notice his Austrian roots in evidence in some of the dishes, such as short rib and tafelspitz terrine, or the Granny Smith and sweetbread strudel. The room is comfortable and neat and the atmosphere grown-up yet animated. When it comes to service though, it appears that the restaurant has mistaken informality for indifference as it lacks coordination or direction. So you may need to remind yourself that you're here primarily for the food. But that food is very good indeed.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Batard-442996-41102
18,Peking Duck House,Cuisine Chinese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"It's worth your while to wend through Chinatown's teeming sidewalks to delight in the eponymous house specialty here. Once inside, however crowded, the neutral-toned interior adds a calming effect to the many tables gearing up for their bird's arrival, and the mode of transport is a linen-draped cart.The duck is deftly carved and dramatically served by the chef himself, so push in your chair and prepare for a festive DIY feast of warm, soft pancakes, cool cucumbers, scallions, and sweet hoisin. Although the duck is what makes this a destination, there are several other entrées like sizzling sliced beef with scallops; and live lobster with ginger and scallions. To begin, the clear golden broth of the duck wonton soup is an appropriate prelude to the main event.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Peking_Duck_House-67540-41102
19,North End Grill,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"Its contemporary look features that same stunning combination of white umbrella-like fixtures, black-stained walls, and midnight blue banquettes. However, the reigning chef in the open kitchen reveals a menu shift towards grilled foods, updated comfort favorites, and charcuterie. Start with an artfully arranged terrine layering strips of pig's ear topped with green beans and mustard vinaigrette. The flavors of wood infuse every element of a thick, blistered pizza decked with potatoes, pancetta, sweet onions, and gently poached eggs. French sensibilities shine in the simply grilled Colorado lamb chops with ribbons of zucchini, baby leeks, and carrots. For dessert, the creamsicle pie bursts with the taste of candied orange, whipped cream, and childhood.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10282-North_End_Grill-366476-41102
20,Tribeca Grill,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Beckoning business titans day and night, this corner restaurant is a destination for its big, bright dining room with well-spaced tables. Wall-to-wall windows overlook two quintessential TriBeCa streets, while exposed brick, moody artwork, and a spectacular bar smack in the center of the room complete the refined vibe. Gigantone, large tubular pasta loaded with a braised short rib Bolognese beneath a dollop of fresh sheep's milk ricotta, makes a rich start to a meal. The decadence continues with seared scallops over creamy carrot risotto, topped with a truffled-Madeira vinaigrette, and brought over the top with a few fragrant shavings of black truffle. Desserts are as classic as the space; try the banana tart with malted chocolate and pecan ice cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Tribeca_Grill-68561-41102

Simple standard.","Even after a renovation, this ""parlor"" continues to thrive as a retro dive replete with truly awful service. But keep reading, because the supremely delicious food and unreal value more than make up for Nom Wah's many flaws.Dim sum is the main draw at this busy neighborhood diner, where small groups fill the dining counter and pack into pleather booths for the likes of pan-fried dumplings stuffed with ground pork and sweet shrimp. Scallion pancakes flaunt outstanding texture; fried shrimp wrapped in bean curd unites top product with heavenly flavor; and noodles sautéed with superior soy is a salt fiends dream.

Bo Ky's steamed-up windows (from the succulent meats roasting inside) are an invitation to come in and get cracking on a perfect bowl of wonton and noodle soup.Crispy skinned and exquisitely juicy chicken drizzled with dark soy and served beside chili-studded nuoc cham may be the closet local sib to the Hong Kong classic, presented here with a Vietnamese touch. Its textural interplay is as first-rate as the house specialty itself- a crispy fried shrimp-and-scallion roll wrapped in bean curd skin.

It's neither massive nor fancy, but it's bright, clean, and perpetually in business. One peek at the specials on the walls (maybe golden-fried squid strewn with sea salt) will have you begging for a seat in the crammed room.Speedy servers scoot between groups of City Hall suits and Asian locals as they order the likes of cha gio, pork spring rolls with nuoc cham; or goi cuon, fantastic summer rolls filled with poached shrimp and vermicelli. Naturally, pho choices are abundant, but the real star of the show is pho tai-where raw beef shavings are cooked to tender perfection when combined with a scalding hot, savory broth replete with herbs, sprouts, and chewy noodles.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10013-Thai_Son-67546-41102

The mien is playful, buzz palpable, and first-rate drinks are flowing. Start with the Tuscan kale-and-romaine salad, enticingly smoky with texturally perfect potato ""croutons"" and paprika vinaigrette.

Muc chien don is a plate of chewy, crisped squid tossed in salt, pepper, and tailed by cucumbers and red onion for ample tang; while the house special pho xe lua reveals a rich, savory broth full of noodles, brisket, and beef tendon.

The region's tasty take on lo mein is a total departure from the familiar version. Here, find a platter of thin noodles topped with pork or duck, served with a side of delicate, consommé-like broth for dipping.However, the biggest treat is the fantastic bo zai fan: rice cooked to crunchy perfection in a clay pot and crowned with ginger, scallions, and a mind-boggling choice of seventeen toppings like frog, pork, and preserved vegetables.

True, they may be serving the same quality fish as the spot above, but the omakase dishes here are incomparably superior. This is immediately clear from the first bit of otoshi, house-made silken tofu with the bold flavors of sea urchin and salmon roe, finished with bits of crisped nori. The kitchen's seasonal influences may be reflected in a springtime bowl of bamboo shoots braised in smoky dashi, or a delicate cube of steamed Japanese red snapper in soy-ginger broth with grated turnip and a fragrant, bright green cherry leaf.

The place is also suitably dark and moody, but it's not so much ""distressed"" as ""mildly neurotic"" because next to the bar is an open kitchen vying for your attention. It's a moot point as to whether this is a bar with a bistro attached or a bistro with a great bar; even those running it can't decide because the volume of the music goes up and down like a fiddler's elbow.In the meantime, the kitchen keeps things fairly simple and does them well enough.

When you do find it you enter into a stylish, beautifully understated and meticulously laid out room that wouldn't look out of place in the pages of ""Wallpaper"" magazine.

A lack of headings makes the two-page menu a daunting document so, instead of trying to construct your own meal, you're better off letting the chefs decide by going for the balanced and seasonal dishes of the seven- or nine-course omakase. Two things will quickly become clear: the ingredients are exceptional and the technical skills of the chefs considerable. This is food that is as rewarding to eat as it is restorative; standouts will be the lingering flavor of Washu beef, perfectly grilled anago, and anything with uni or their homemade tofu. There are tables available but it's so much more satisfying to sit at the counter and engage with the chefs-this way, you may even find that there are a few more dishes in their repertoire than they advertise.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Hirohisa-441660-41102

Pan-seared red snapper over crispy jasmine rice cakes and sautéed vegetables in ginger-peanut sauce is a show of well-balanced textures and bracing flavors; but a handmade chocolate sampler remains the true starlet, with each morsel as decadent as the next.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Aquagrill-69410-41102
64,Café el Portal,Cuisine Mexican,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"In an area paved by PR campaigns and flashy restaurants, one authentic Mexican spot trudges on, in a pocket-sized room decked out with the bright colors of a hacienda. While some may view it as kitschy (it's hardly a hipster hangout), foodies gather here for the unique cooking churned out of this genuine kitchen. The fundamentals that distinguish authentic tacos from the Tex-Mex version are more than adequately covered in the carnitas taco. Tortillas, properly warmed on the comal, encase tender pulled pork and jalapeño and are topped with a complex, spicy salsa with just a pinch of cilantro-as fresh as any native could hope to taste. Foodies are equally thankful for the flor de calabaza quesadilla drizzled with avocado purée and filled with zucchini.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Cafe_el_Portal-184976-41102
65,Louie and Chan,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"With a name that nods to the convergence of Chinese and Italian immigrants in this part of lower Manhattan, Louie and Chan is a dimly lit, tightly packed restaurant with inspired cooking. The main space feels more bar than dining room, with intentionally scruffy walls decorated with distressed mirrors. Service is friendly and a young crowd keeps things lively. Cocktails are Asian-inspired while the menu uses Italy as its muse. Delicate gnudi arrive in a rustic bowl of tender lamb ragù topped with a dollop of smoked ricotta. A wood-burning oven is responsible for the blistered crust pizzas, including the bacio del diavolo, decked with tart tomato sauce, chunks of 'nduja, house-made mozzarella, and spicy whole Calabrese peppers.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-Louie_and_Chan-468087-41102

Tables are itsy-bitsy, but the kitchen feels immense in its creative vision and dilation of traditional Thai fare. Refined techniques and top ingredients combine to produce a blend of homegrown-haute cuisine that's presented with exceptional service here. Laab neuh gae sets hand-chopped lamb ablaze with chilies, lime, and mint, whereas tender snails doused in a gently spiced green curry reveal a deep knowledge of nuanced savors. Funky flavors reach full bloom in gaeng som muu krob, crisp pork belly floating in a tart tamarind curry of sausage-stuffed squid, perfectly foiled by sweet lychees. And for a brazen show of taste and texture, tuck into the crispy duck leg (pet palo), served in a soy-anise broth with caramelized tangerine and a soft-cooked egg. Dessert highlights include a coconut sundae accentuated by salty peanuts. And brioche French toast, dunked into condensed milk and caramelized to perfection, is a far cry from its ""milquetoast"" moniker.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Uncle_Boons-404305-41102

Although it may be loud and cramped with the requisite 80's tunes blaring overhead, this adept Italian-American kitchen is bright with classic dishes and a pizza recipe, which as the menu reads, is a 55-year old Staten Island heirloom. The classic pizza balances a cracker-thin crispy crust with tart tomato sauce and oven-browned spots of salty, melting mozzarella. Catch the pasta special like paccheri with subtly sweet and spicy sugo and meaty, tender roasted pork. Night owls may simply snack on the selection of alluring antipasti like mini arancini, but it's worth tasting how efficiently this kitchen can feed the crowds.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Rubirosa-331705-41102

Sporting a small, but sharply designed interior by Louis Yoh, replete with schoolhouse chairs and reclaimed bowling alley wood tables, Houseman's seasonal menu isn't extensive, but each dish is extremely well-sourced-not to mention well-executed, with the help of co-chef, Adam Baumgart. Kick things off with a grilled tomato salad, bursting with fresh herbs, salty feta and smoky shishito peppers.

Moreover, this unaffectedly warm and very classic bistro boasts zero pretense and deserves all praise that comes its way. Its décor may have stayed the same through the years-think timeless-but those bar seats remain a hot ticket. This ""chef's canteen"" as it is typically hailed is well-tread for masterpieces like fresh shucked oysters; smoked trout salad tossed with sour cream and zippy horseradish; or matzo ball soup-enjoyable, aromatic, and full of root vegetables. Fried chicken with mashed potatoes takes home the gold medal for comfort classics, while banana-walnut bread pudding with caramel sauce is the very essence of decadence.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Blue_Ribbon-69412-41102

A sushi bar dominates the space, with colorful sake bottles and premium spirits on display. The low, wood-covered ceilings and polished tables provide an intimate setting, while the counter is a prime perch for a solo diner. The staff may point to Americanized options, but it's best to trust the expert chefs and go with an omakase. The menu divides itself into Taiheiyo (""Pacific"") offerings, like the kohada spotted sardine, or a sweet and briny giant clam; and Taiseiyo (""Atlantic""), perhaps featuring fluke fin or a spicy lobster knuckle.

You can't go wrong with the handful of pastas on the menu, such as the lovingly crafted pouches of spinach and ricotta ravioli in a light tomato sauce.

The décor is charmingly rustic-picture whitewashed walls, bare wood tables, and a bustling downstairs wine bar. Kick things off with ricotta and otherworldly bread, fresh from the visible centerpiece hearth-which is the main method of cooking and sets this spot apart. But save room for house-made lasagna with braised rabbit ragù, creamy béchamel, and sweet root vegetables; tender razor clams in a fragrant white wine broth; succulent porchetta studded with garlic and rosemary; or stewed and perfectly chewy trippa alla Romana.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Peasant-113410-41102

It's this Italian-inspired café's attention to detail that has made it a local mainstay, filled with gorgeous crowds and friendly servers. Here, everyone shares conversation over sips set to go with complimentary spreads or ""aperitivo"" like crispy pancetta with rosemary. Although the space is small, flavors are huge, and the same attention that went into décor goes into the food-from grass-feed beef to excellent handmade orecchiette with cauliflower and shrimp.

It's no surprise that two sister tavernas have sprouted in the West Village and Hell's Kitchen. The Mediterranean menu features plenty of signatures including marinated anchovies wrapped in grape leaves, garlicky skordalia, and earthy Macedonian wines.

Chef Amanda Cohen and team quickly transplanted themselves to bigger, bolder digs, where industrial elements meld with bright white walls and a chic bar proffers both cocktails and consolation seating.

Delicate details like fresh, fragrant flowers, beautifully set tables, and cozy rattan chairs make for romantic environs-and though the tight space has a way of turning intimate whispers into public displays of affection, all will be forgiven after a bite or two of Chef Brad Steelman's solid-as-ever cuisine. Launch into plump wild shrimp smothered in creamy Hollandaise and served with crunchy white asparagus for added texture; or the perfectly crisped crab cake arranged with creamy uni, avocado, and a light herb salad. Pearly white halibut with roasted maitakes is a testament to the kitchen's focus on simplicity and supreme freshness, while a glistening rack of mint- and mustard seed-glazed lamb-charred on the outside with an evenly pink interior-exemplifies its artistry.

After slowly expanding to neighboring storefronts over the past few years, the owners have now realized its much-deserved grandeur without losing its charm. Expats plus locals are de rigueur here, and routinely stop in for incredibly delicious and unbelievably hearty eats. Co-chef and owner Erwin Schrottner (who hails from outside Graz) keeps everything authentic, from house-made bratwurst platters to the mustard sour cream.

The décor features unique bronze mailboxes, where box-holders are delivered artisanal wines hand-selected by the chef, and private rooms contoured with billowing fabrics. A first-come, first-serve ""Sunday Supper"" menu is offered every Sunday with limited seating, and almost always sells out. Chef Brad Farmerie's menu is truly innovative-fusion might be an overused descriptor, but it aptly describes his style. Never shy to marry unique items in interesting ways (think smoked paprika oil paired with pea shoots), a sample Farmerie dinner might include house-made ricotta cavatelli tossed in a lovely carrot sauce fashioned like a Bolognese, with pickled ramps, candied sunflower seeds, and a ramp purée; or tender New Zealand venison with pickled beets, hibiscus, currants, and a quinoa-black garlic salad.

Simple, unpretentious food is the signature here, in dishes like insalata di carota, mixing sweet roasted carrots, peppery arugula, and pumpkin seeds-grab wedges of bread to soak up its citrusy vinaigrette.

Wander in on any given night and you'll see a crowd of all ages united in their fondness for French food and their ability to enjoy themselves. The menu wouldn't necessarily entice the passer-by on content alone but the kitchen has a surprisingly delicate touch that raises dishes above the ordinary, whether that's tender octopus with chickpea purée or succulent rack of lamb with oyster mushrooms.

The dining room is as dim as a cave-its palette of concrete and ebony brightened only by a white marble bar and gracious team of servers who know when they're needed and seem to disappear when they're not. Rebelle has an edgy vibe-the space was once a burlesque bar, after all. But, beneath that veneer is impressive talent delivered with a sexy French accent. While Chef Daniel Eddy's streamlined presentations and foam flourishes have contemporary flair, rest assured that classic technique is at the root of every dish. Lamb tartare is perfectly balanced, boasting piment d'Espelette-kissed cubes of meat tossed with green chickpeas, strained yogurt, and a slice of excellent toasted bread. Then, exceptionally tender pork loin is served over a mustard-tinged sauce with wilted greens, grilled spring onions, and a delicious bite of deep-fried headcheese.

House-smoked whole wheat bread arrives with freshly churned ""chicken butter"" (that's butter with chicken fat) and maple syrup. A lamb belly and guajillo pepper roulade rests in goat-milk yogurt, topped with crushed almonds, pea tendrils, and paper-thin slices of radish.

Service underwhelms and the scene is quirky, but the focus here is solely on the noodles and noodles alone. Curry dip soba arrives as a shallow bamboo basket of firm, chilled noodles just as a heavily spiced sauce with pork, ginger, and green onion bubbles away in a clay pot set atop a small flame. Dunk these strands of cold soba into the hot broth and let the slurping begin. Then rest assured that when you're done, the curry is fortified with hot soba water to form a delicious and drinkable soup.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-cocoron-468085-41102

Service is basic and the décor kitschy at best, but it's clean, tidy, and tons of fun. This soothing namesake porridge comes in myriad forms-ladled into a clay pot with bits of crispy roasted duck skin, or mingled with pork liver and white fish to form an intense and rich flavor combination. Pair it with dunkable sticks of puffy deep-fried Chinese crullers for a satisfying contrast in texture.

Distressed mirrors, vaulted ceilings, and iron accents fill the dark, cavernous space with a certain broody, old-world vibe. Long communal tables are ideal for groups lingering over small plates and a long list of gin-based cocktails. Nibbling should be the strategy here, starting with whole deviled eggs stuffed with tangy-sweet gribiche beneath a single crunchy fried oyster. Crispy bite-sized bombas filled with creamy potato, Manchego, and Serrano ham sit in a very nice, mildly spicy tomato sauce.

When the long bar and closely set tables are at capacity, conversations bouncing off the wood-paneled walls can reach a dull roar. Still, the atmosphere remains relaxed. The modern pub menu covers all the bases with panache. The griddled Bash burger, slathered with house-made caramelized onion and bacon jam crowned with two crisp onion rings, is a memorable affair. Lighter dishes like a traditional panzanella with chewy-crusty bread cubes and translucent cucumber slices; or chilled sweet-and-tart corn soup with chunks of peekytoe crab are just as satisfying.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Burger_Barrel-331701-41102

Regulars perch at the bar to watch the 'tender whip up a cocktail or classic egg cream, while serious diners find a seat and get noshing on hot- and cold-smoked Scottish salmon teamed with potato crisps. The result? A thrilling contrast in flavor and texture. Caramelized chocolate babka French toast is crowned with strawberries for a sweet-savory treat; and ""eggs Benny"" with salmon, spinach, and challah never fails to peg a bruncher.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-Russ_Daughters_Cafe-468088-41102

To whet their thirst, wine bottles topping a wall-length table in the back dining room are presented and poured with panache. Chef Matt Lambert's forte is the modern cuisine of New Zealand with a contemporary twist. While he may be a Kiwi ambassador, Chef Lambert uses his understanding of very particular ingredients to craft dishes that are seasonal, delicious, and sometimes wildly creative. A rum-cured torchon of foie gras is at once dense yet melting upon contact, accompanied by sweet dates, tart green apple gel, and buttery brioche. Provenance is clearly a high priority in the exceptional Ora king salmon; the bright and supple tranche is topped with freeze-dried Satsuma, citrus oil, and herbs to complement its delicate flavor. For dessert, the superb carrot cake pulls together a spectrum of textures and tastes. However, the stark white, crisp pavlova filled with passion fruit curd, whipped cream, slivered strawberries, and passion fruit pulp is a true classic.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-The_Musket_Room-404304-41102

The narrow dining room is loud and cramped, boasting a kitchen that has both its eye on simplicity and an applause-worthy knack for elegant offerings. To that end, Estela's irreverent chef turns out focused, decidedly creative, and (very) small plates. Grilled bread laden with mussels and a tangy aïoli turns into a dazzling bite when paired with pickled carrots, just as beef tartare tossed in chili oil is smartly teamed with sunchoke crisps for sweet and savory hints. And while your greeting upon entry may be less than agreeable, a quivering, bee pollen-crowned panna cotta makes for an utterly perfect goodbye.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Estela-405986-41102
95,Gran Eléctrica,Cuisine Mexican,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","Looking to market ingredients and a California-style approach to Mexican cuisine, this chic yet comfortable restaurant impresses with its lovely décor and lively vibe. Servers are engaged and enthusiastic about the menu's pleasures. An ideal visit starts with a margarita at the bar and moves to the garden as strings of lights flicker to life. Mexico and Brooklyn are in balance on a menu that includes small plates such as memelitas de frijoles, a masa disc topped with mashed black beans, spicy salsa verde, queso fresco, and crema. Flavor is bright in the deliciously untraditional poblano chile relleno stuffed with Havarti, roasted tomato-jalapeño salsa, and tortillas. Try the frijoles de la olla (black beans topped with avocado) on the side.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11201-Gran_Electrica-366511-41102
96,Cómodo,Cuisine Latin American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This charming, candlelit restaurant flaunts a Latin tilt while maintaining its very American, homey feel. Away from artsy SoHo this quiet slice of the neighborhood draws locals looking for an unfussy meal with bright flavors. The small space has exposed brick, two long communal tables, a semi-open kitchen, and carefully chosen music. Detail sets Cómodo apart, beginning with a thick, deep evergreen cilantro soup poured tableside, over a mound of fresh crab, smoky roasted poblano peppers, and tart goat cheese. The interesting and very approachable dishes go on to include lamb sliders on pão de queijo (Brazilian bread made with cheese and cassava) finished with a pop of chipotle cream. Coffee-rubbed slow-roasted pork shoulder shouldn't be missed.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Comodo-399640-41102
97,Emilio's Ballato,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This unassuming Houston St. standard is an unsung hero, even if many walk past Emilio's gold- and red-etched window and write it off as some run-of-the-mill red sauce joint. Step inside the narrow, weathered space, where owner Emilio Vitolo offers each guest a personal welcome and a genuine Italian-American experience. The menu is filled with pasta classics like Roman cacio e pepe, tossed with sharp pecorino cheese and freshly ground black pepper. Signature specialties include pollo Emilio, a delicately breaded chicken cutlet draped in lemon-caper sauce; and plump clams oreganata speckled with garlicky breadcrumbs. Crisp cannoli shells filled with vanilla- and cinnamon-tinged ricotta cream rival any other version found from Palermo to Siracusa.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Emilio_s_Ballato-435417-41102
98,Charlie Bird,Cuisine Italian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Of all the cool out-of-the-way restaurants that dot this stretch of SoHo, perhaps none are hipper than little Charlie Bird. You'll be greeted by a blast of music the second you hit the door, where a long bar leads to a cozy, brick-lined dining space with leather seats. From there, things just take off: along with the clever, urbane menu, an upbeat service staff, and thoughtful wine list brimming with sweet Puglian reds and organic Catalonians, the kitchen delights long before Chef/co-owner Ryan Hardy's renowned pastas hit your plate. Think tender rigatoni with fennel-roasted suckling pig; or perfectly al dente spaghetti alla carbonara piled into a heavenly ball and topped with buttery spring onions, smoked bacon, and a bright yellow duck egg.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Charlie_Bird-405985-41102
99,Contra,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Avant-garde Contra brims with a youthful vibe, from the music overhead to the chefs' creativity. Beyond the entrance's neon sign is a small, lamp-lit space with exposed brick and inviting banquettes. At the bar, patrons can sample the forward-thinking fare or fully indulge in an affordable five-course menu. An experimental spirit is clear from the first bite of a warm poppy- and sesame seed-loaf brushed with pork fat and served with sweet-cream butter. Mackerel arrives with blistered skin, tender peas, favas, and charred Padron peppers. Superlative desserts show glimmers of genius, as in the loosely whipped cloud of sunchoke purée with warm toffee caramel and icy apple granita. Visit Wildair a few doors down for like-minded cuisine in a more casual setting by the same team.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-Contra-435843-41102
100,Sauce,Cuisine Italian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"What would you expect from a spot called Sauce? Some serious and very delicious red sauce-naturally! Serving Italian-American comfort food with a nostalgic décor to match, Sauce stays modern with its local, hipster-friendly playlist, and quirky ambience-the attractive crowd doesn't hurt either. It's a fun meal to say the least. Pasta is made in-house daily, with specials that feature potato-kale gnocchi or the signature ricotta cavatelli showered with pecorino. The menu highlights regional specialties from Little Italys across the country, including SF's cioppino and classic Nuyorkese tomato gravy like nonna used to make. Try the robust Sergio Leone steak smothered in tomato sauce and topped with a fried heritage egg for tons of fun and flavor.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-Sauce-368532-41102
101,Miss Lily's,Cuisine Jamaican,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Authentic Jamaican flavors and thumping reggae go hand-in-hand amid Miss Lily's bright orange booths, retro artifacts, and Formica-topped tables. Wide-open windows overlooking buzzy Houston Street merely add to the allure. A well-stocked bar and bins filled with produce set the mood for enjoyable classics brought to you at the hands of glam servers. Start with jerk chicken that is insanely moist yet nearly black with intense spices, served with Scotch bonnet sauce that will have your mouth tingling for hours. Then cool down with Melvin's ""body good"" salad tossing kale, radish, celery, and apples in a citrus-ginger vinaigrette. From the Jamaican Sampler-think curry coat, oxtail stew, and callaloo-to a boozy rum cake, this Caribbean queen reigns supreme.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Miss_Lily_s-331690-41102
102,ZZ's Clam Bar,Cuisine Seafood,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Simple standard. Our best addresses.","A bouncer greets you at the door of this sexy little seafood nook, where you're ushered into a tiny, beautifully appointed dining room lined with just five white marble tables and sleek dark wood paneling. For a hot second, you might feel like you're the only one in the know about this secret lair, until the hip diners rubbing elbows at every table disabuse you of this notion. But really, once you get past the silly bouncer, you will never want to leave this den. And although you'll pay a handsome price for small portions here, when each bite sings with this much freshness and flavor, who's counting? Kick things off with anything from the amazing raw bar, where you'll find wildly fresh goodies like creamy oysters bursting with briny flavor. Then move on to delicate, salty trout roe laced with truffle honey and set over a thick slice of buttery toast; otherworldly uni toast, perfectly sweet and laid over malty pretzel with mustard oil and chopped chives; or melt-in-your-mouth Chianina beef carpaccio with luxurious Santa Barbara uni and caviar. And finally, this sleek, contoured, and sexy bar puts out some of the most sublime cocktails in town.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-ZZ_s_Clam_Bar-406586-41102
103,Cherche Midi,Cuisine French,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Restaurateur Keith McNally went back to his bistro roots with Cherche Midi, his restaurant on a bustling SoHo epicenter of sorts. Romantic, French, and timeless, this inviting space is filled with spectacular flower arrangements, burgundy leather booths, antique mirrors, and a semi-round bar with wood stools. A pot de fromage sets the tone for the meal. This luscious parmesan custard, served with toast points slathered in anchovy butter, is simple, satisfying with just the right amount of richness. At lunch, a steak sandwich with aged Gruyère and bacon marmalade on a Balthazar-baked brioche bun is a hit. At dinner, opt for elevated classics like the bone-in skate wing meunière with onion-fennel soubise. Don't forget some pencil-thin pommes frites on the side.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Cherche_Midi-468094-41102
104,Lupa,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","One of the best places for a solid plate of pasta, Lupa fits in snugly between the fire escape-clad walk-ups and charming boutiques along these streets. A modestly decorated spot named for the she-wolf who raised Romulus and Remus, this gem carries an air of relaxed sophistication. It's where neighbors can gather for polite conversation over quartinos of Ligurian wine or the massive collection of amari. If it's a lovely place to sit, it's a stellar place to dine. Textbook-perfect pasta shines here, with luscious bucatini all' amatriciana earning its mark among Lazio classics as well as the beguilingly simple yet stunning cacio e pepe. Entrées may sometimes miss the mark, but dessert more than makes up for it-try the unique cardamom panna cotta.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Lupa-67403-41102
105,Gato,Cuisine Mediterranean,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"It's been nearly a decade since Bobby Flay opened a restaurant in NY, and Gato has the famed chef's recipe down. With soaring arched brick ceilings, exposed brass fixtures, and views of Lafayette Street, this hip hangout exudes a slick downtown sensibility. In fact, the cozy lounge and massive wooden bar are so cool, you may never make it to the dining room-which is fine, because the beautifully composed small plates pack plenty of flavor. Case in point: quail egg and creamy uni atop a tender artichoke on a plate dressed up with dots of oils and shellfish reduction. Lamb tenderloin needs hardly any marinade thanks to the top-quality meat, a rich pink center, and salsa verde; while smoky eggplant balances earthy and sweet with Manchego and balsamic vinegar.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Gato-442174-41102
106,Atrium,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"This industrial bi-level space has a rather iconic setting along the waterfront, between the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. Dark wood dominates the light-filled interior, amid metal accents and walls that sprout greenery to soften the room. The food may have a farm-to-table focus, but a contemporary tilt is clear in everything that emerges from Atrium's bustling open kitchen. Elegant ""baby greens"" arrive as enticingly charred root vegetables over peppery arugula coulis; whereas crisply seared red snapper served over wild rice with dashi-simmered baby turnips, meaty mushrooms, and finished with a rich fumet makes the chef's (Laurent Kalkotour) French heritage abundantly clear. The chocolate-dipped crème fraîche and quark cheesecake is deservedly popular.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11201-Atrium-435420-41102
107,Carbone,Cuisine Italian,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Good standard. Our best addresses.","With nostalgia at the forefront, Carbone is plain gorgeous. While this big, bold, and beautiful ode to Italian-Americana comes alive at night under the low lights, lunch is equally admired among brash bankers with big appetites and Valentino-donning divas. That same sense of history pervades the entire space, which highlights plush banquettes, impressive ceramics, and glittering chandeliers. Was the striking tiled-floor inspired from a certain restaurant scene in The Godfather? Probably. Mid-century classics are what this menu is all about, but exalted ingredients, skill, and presentations will excite even the most cynical savant. Stylish servers-who work the floor with a little flirt and lot of flair-remain in character while presenting top antipasti like crusty garlic bread, soppressata, and fresh, particularly divine olive oil-dunked mozzarella. A Caesar salad tossed tableside with carb-worthy croutons and gently pickled white anchovies hits the ball out of the park, while pale-yellow, ricotta-filled tortellini over an intensely rich and meaty ragù is a laudable delight. Desserts like a proper cheesecake set atop a cookie-crumb base and laced with lemon curd is New York in all its old-school glory.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Carbone-404292-41102
108,Spitzer's Corner,Cuisine Gastropub,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Spitzer's is a spirited corner eatery dedicated to craft brews and gastropub fare in a buzzing locale. Large glass windows overlook the heart of the neighborhood, providing an entertaining vantage point for people-watching over pints of nutty Bronx Pale Ale. There are large communal tables made of reclaimed wood and chalkboards listing comfort food classics. This is a cozy drinking den, and its kitchen focuses on food that pairs well with suds. Tables are laden with quality renditions of burgers and mac 'n cheese. Spinach and artichoke dip is equally comforting, topped with broiled cheese and served with chargrilled pita. A fried chicken sandwich sees generous chunks of crunchy thigh meat stuffed into potato rolls with butter lettuce and a pickle.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-Spitzer_s_Corner-257879-41102
109,Wassail,Cuisine Gastropub,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Everyone's buzzing about Wassail's awesome list of 90+ ciders from around the world, but there are a few delectable reasons to check out this Lower East Side gem. Chef Joseph Buenconsejo's vegetable- and grain-focused menu is initially a surprise, but the technique, seasonality, and personality he brings to each dish will sway even the most adamant carnivore. Witness peas done three ways-mashed, julienned, sliced in their pods, and plated with creamy ricotta, pea broth, and mini parathas; or a glossy, slow-cooked egg served over salty broccolini and shredded Brussels sprouts with a lemony sorrel Hollandaise. Rebecca Eichenbaum's savory-leaning desserts, like a frozen spruce soufflé topped with buttermilk granita and pistachio crumble, are pure bliss.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-Wassail-472169-41102

Good standard.","Super chef, Daniel Boulud, shakes off some of his signature upmarket panache with this downtown favorite. The fun-for-all brasserie joins a lively bar area to a rear dining room, open kitchen, and chef's table. The space recalls the Bowery's history as a hub for restaurant supplies: dry goods are prominently shelved, bathroom walls are papered with vintage cookware catalogs, and gleaming copper pots (engraved with the names of famed French chefs) are on display. Luxe burgers and a globally inspired lineup of house-made sausages are all popular. But go on to explore other dishes like the lunch prix-fixe offering decadent country pâté, ricotta and spinach ravioli in Vermont veal Bolognese, as well as a lemon bar with meringue bits and blueberry sorbet.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-DBGB_Kitchen_Bar-260082-41102
111,Jack the Horse,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"A Brooklyn Heights favorite, this sleepy American tavern is a consistent spot in a neighborhood that lacks a variety of serious eats. Exposed brick walls covered with old-fashioned clocks set a cozy tone, and regulars return for the well-stocked bar with myriad bitters and a bargain three-course prix-fixe. Slurp a few bivalves at the Oyster Room next door before settling into a table, or if thirst beckons, sip an Old Fashioned with barrel strength Bourbon while perusing the menu. Some locals head straight for the burger-focaccia layered with Gruyère, caramelized Bourbon onions, and a juicy beef patty. Though ricotta and butternut squash ravioli, tossed in sweet brown butter and topped with crumbled smoky bacon, is a fine alternative.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11201-Jack_the_Horse-257538-41102
112,Bowery Meat Company,Cuisine Steakhouse,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Good standard.,"It's official: Chef Josh Capon, also of Lure Fishbar and El Toro Blanco, can now add sizzling steaks to his impressive wheelhouse. Cozy velvet booths, dusky blue floor-to-ceiling drapery, and dark wood details honor the swagger of the steakhouse archetype, but crowds of millennials lend a fresh face to this buzzy downtown address. A list of specially selected oysters from the raw bar-like kumamotos from Washington State dressed with wasabi leaf and lemon-or zucchini carpaccio with feta and toasted pistachios prelude Bowery Meat Company's red-blooded roster. This may reveal a bone-in filet mignon au poivre, dry-aged NY strip, and grilled pork ribeye with Korean barbecue sauce. And, don't overlook those side dishes-the sour cream and onion hash brown is a must.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Bowery_Meat_Company-468060-41102
113,Mas (farmhouse),Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"Tucked away on Bedford Street, Mas (farmhouse) proves why restaurant design matters as much as the menu when creating a complete sensory experience. Carefully selected accents-weathered wood beams, hand-stitched pillows, antique mother-of-pearl napkin rings-bring to life a modern Provençal farmhouse, where rusticity, hospitality and sophistication play in perfect harmony with the culinary arts. Poached shrimp floats in an apple-ginger bath topped with radish, for a cooling yet spicy amuse-bouche to arouse the appetite. This may be followed by delicate fillets of Long Island fluke served over hearts of palm with smoky and earthy shiitake mushrooms. That attention to detail and mouth-filling flavor keeps you engaged, charmed, and absolutely satisfied.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Mas_farmhouse-68085-41102
114,Blue Ribbon Bakery,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"The origin of this very New York bistro begins with brothers Eric and Bruce Bromberg discovering an abandoned brick oven in the basement of a bodega. This sparked the idea for a bakery, and in 1998 Blue Ribbon Bakery joined the duo's restaurant family. The sunny corner location is an inviting space, from the creaky wood-plank flooring to the heady aroma of freshly baked bread downstairs. Seats at the bar are a hot commodity for solo diners. Opt for a dish that showcases the bakery's bread, such as the beef marrow with bacon bread and onion marmalade, a decadent appetizer that is just the right amount of sweet, salty, tart, and rich. Fried chicken with silky mashed potatoes and the matzoh ball soup both show Blue Ribbon's skill with comforting classics.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Blue_Ribbon_Bakery-70634-41102
115,A Casa Fox,Cuisine Latin American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This bold and bright darling serves superlative Latin fare with fantastic authenticity and a whole lotta love. This is largely thanks to Chef/owner Melissa Fox, who can be seen in the open kitchen or checking on guests in the snug space, filled with Mexican tiles, wide plank floors, and a warming fireplace. Be sure to begin any meal with a selection of empanadas, as in pulled pork with caramelized onion, chorizo and aged manchego, or the outstanding carne enchorizada (seasoned ground beef with onions, tomatoes, yucca, chayote, and potatoes). Other dishes might include the camarones a las brazes, grilled shrimp in a sour-orange marinade wrapped in smoky bacon; or chicken tostones, its pulled meat on a well-grilled round of masa with crema and mango salsa.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-A_Casa_Fox-270926-41102
116,L'Apicio,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Despite being named for an 18th century Italian cookbook, this buzzy trattoria is a contemporary hit. A downtown vibe courses throughout the swanky den that is slightly rustic and industrial-this setting is worth dressing up for. Half of the room is devoted to the bar, and the private dining room is best suited to exhibitionists who enjoy dining within glass walls in the center of the room. Bright flavors and skilled creativity combine in their tailored selection of Italian plates designed for grazing. Start with dishes like fried green tomatoes capped with sweet basil pesto and milky mozzarella, or fresh agnolotti stuffed with sweetbreads. Finish with a wedge of moist olive oil cake sweetened with crème fraîche and vin santo-soaked raisins.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-L_Apicio-399611-41102
117,SakaMai,Cuisine Japanese,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"A modern izakaya like no other, SakaMai sets a new standard for downtown cuisine. With its chic urban style, a curated sake- shochu- and whiskey-list, and creative dishes, this authentic haunt draws a food- and drink-focused crowd that's more interested in Japanese sips than pints of beer. Plates are meant to be shared, sashimi are top-notch, and flavors simply impress: a well-seasoned Waygu steak arrives with roasted vegetables and tasty sauces; while a porcelain sea urchin shell, filled with gently scrambled eggs, caviar, and more sea urchin, is as decadent as it sounds. For an exceptional balance between flavor and texture, try the kanpachi dressed with a chiffonade of shiso, myoga, yuzu juice, freshly ground wasabi, and shoyu glaze.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-SakaMai-399631-41102

Rich wood tones and warm lighting achieve a clubby atmosphere, from the buzzing long bar and communal table to the intimate, serene dining room's banquettes dressed with pristine linens. Begin with a palate-pleasing surprise in cocktails like the celery gimlet. Then, sample rotating house-made ""pots"" filled with mousses like eggplant topped with sweet-sour relish and taro chips, or chicken liver with port and pepper jelly served with grilled sourdough bread. Seared branzino over cranberry bean and kale stew with tomato-caper broth and shaved fennel highlights wonderfully complementary flavors.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Saxon_Parole-360566-41102

Simple standard.","There's a reason diners from all over the city clamor to squeeze into Bianca's low-lit and lovely little dining room, despite its no reservations policy. This is home-style Italian fare with finesse-where the pasta is cooked by someone accomplished in the understanding of what Italian pasta is and is not. Bianca's intimate and sultry atmosphere makes it a great date night spot, with couples knocking elbows over dishes like the lasagnette di verdure, a delicate eggplant, zucchini and tomato tart of sorts. Others delight in the soft tagliolini ai frutti di mare, tossed with wildly fresh seafood and a long-simmered tomato sauce; or plump, fennel-studded Italian sausage (salsiccie e fagioli), paired with a hearty and savory cannellini bean stew.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Bianca-122743-41102

The hardest seats to nab are found downstairs, but the rustic dining room remains as inviting as ever, with tables full of vittles and vino. The kitchen showcases meticulously sourced ingredients that sing the praises of regional Italian know-how, like a mound of arugula, petite mustards, and chrysanthemum greens that top a rather tiny veal Milanese cooked to moist perfection. Thick ribbons of toothsome homemade tagliatelle tossed with myriad mushrooms, melted leeks, and pecorino emits a lovely aroma, befitting this unique and pretty pearl. Meanwhile, the porchetta-served once a year as a sort of sidewalk celebration-is still one of the best in town.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Il_Buco-70637-41102

The multi-level room is sexy yet remains timeless despite its age. Those chic, dark leather banquettes provide plenty of space for large groups to kick back to whatever the DJ spins in the second-floor lounge. This isn't a place for conversation between friends, but rather a large group destination for delicious small plates like crisp red snapper tacos with creamy avocado and zesty mango salsa. Tasty Asian flavors combine seamlessly with chunks of skewered salmon cooked rare and coated in crunchy sriracha-infused peas over cold soba and earthy beets.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-The_Stanton_Social-113845-41102

Here on the Lower East Side (and at the West Village outpost), it is an intimate small plates restaurant with a long bar of counter seating, semi-open kitchen, and exposed brick walls with stocked shelves of Latin pantry ingredients. Sharing is the strategy here, from the crispy chicken croquettes to the raw kale and manchego salad with crunchy roasted pumpkin seeds and a sweet kick from sticky dried dates, topped with a lemon-chipotle dressing. Be prepared to battle over the last bite of arroz con pollo, a piping-hot cast iron pan of plump bomba rice, piquant chorizo, tender chicken, and cherry tomatoes.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-Macondo-257877-41102

It's the kind of wonderful, low-key spot that begs you to become a regular: vibrant, casual and polished, with the kind of beer list you get excited about and a menu that (true to the restaurant's moniker) stops to make you think. Dinner might begin with blanquette de veau, tender, perfectly cooked veal in a mouthwatering white sauce, surrounded by a lovely jardinière of vegetables and served with fragrant white rice. And then finish with a luscious crêpe Suzette, laced with a delicious caramel-orange drizzle and scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10012-Le_Philosophe-399623-41102

Plunked on prime Lower East Side real estate, the commanding bistro's white-tile exterior, black- and white-tiled floor, and wrought-iron doors invite groups of friends for cocktails and $1 oyster happy hour at the curved bar. While the libations aren't standout, they are a nice complement to tried-and-true classics like braised pork tacos folded with pineapple, tomatillos, pickled red onion, and lime crema with a devilish salsa habanera. A braised brisket patty melt with a decadent blend of pepper jack, mustard, and balsamic onions is as faultless as a tart and refreshing Key lime pie.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-Schiller_s_Liquor_Bar-70097-41102

The windowed room feels barnyard-chic, with a chalkboard wall listing wine and cheese offerings beneath reclaimed ceiling beams. The menu is stocked with the kind of dishes that never disappoint-think bucatini tossed with fried eggplant and creamy burrata in a chunky tomato sauce. The kitchen's knack for making simple food vivid is clear in the impeccably cooked strip loin, served with carrots, haricots verts, and shishitos brought together with smoked chili ""pesto.""

The three-story interior fills nightly with a very European crowd. (Romantics head downstairs; Bacchanalians go up.) High quality fusion dishes may seem more crowd-pleasing than inventive, but are nonetheless delicious. Behind the wood sushi bar, the buzzing kitchen rolls mountains of maki, like paper-thin slices of pristine scallops balanced with a thick soy-jalapeño sauce and yuzu kosho. The soba nomi ""risotto"" is a wickedly rich and unmissable dish of glistening buckwheat soba folded with trout butter, king crab, and shrimp beneath a thatch of bonito flakes and gold paper.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-BONDST-67396-41102

Gone are the knickknacks that were previously sprinkled throughout this small room, which now seats about 30 at a single row of tables and long bar counter. From his station in the open kitchen, the chef gives American cuisine a creative re-working. Broccoli meets skordalia in an appetizer of caramelized florets dressed with grated pecorino, sliced almonds, pistachios, and toasted garlic. Beef brisket is slow-braised then griddled, and plated with house-made steak sauce and spicy radish chow-chow. A sundae of chocolate chip banana bread with vanilla ice cream and bananas Foster sauce is yet another example of this enjoyable hybrid cuisine.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Joe_MissesDoe-253701-41102

The menu's dedication to bistro classics and New York steakhouse fare ensure its continued longevity. A thick slice of their mosaic-like terrine of oxtail, poached leek, and carrot surrounding a foie gras center is timelessly good. Those warm platters of juicy, tender, appetizingly charred New York strip steaks propped up against a bouquet of peppery watercress shine with simple, perfect flavor. An oval cast-iron pan of slow-cooked pork shank is rendered tender, luscious, and dark as a prune. Piping-hot pommes aligot are just what mashed potatoes were always meant to be: cheesy, creamy, and obscenely decadent.

A pomelo salad arrives in juicy little clusters over chrysanthemum greens with deep-fried shallots; while impossibly moist shao kao lamb is skewered, then barbecued to spicy perfection with red chili pepper.

Delightful house-pickled vegetables include salt-pickled Napa cabbage, sweet-and-sour shavings of watermelon radish, and Brussels sprouts in curry vinegar. And with its foundation of hijiki seaweed rice, the lush unagi bowl is a treat.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Wasan-442173-41102
160,Pagani,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"With witty cocktails, cured meats, and rustico nuovo décor, Pagani brings an extra dose of Italian charm to Bleecker Street, and a good one at that. Flauting a vibrant scene of locals guzzling indigenous Italian wines and Averna-steeped drinks, this brainchild of Massimo Lusardi targets a younger brood where authenticity and creativity go hand-in-hand. His family may own several other restaurants, but sizeable portions of house-made pasta with updated embellishments (think: montasio cheese topping a decadent ragù of veal and pork) highlight balance and excellence. Just as veal shoulder arrives unbelievably fragrant and tender with herb-rubbed, toasted bread; rigatoni with braised rabbit and sweet carrots feel like a match made in culinary heaven.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Pagani-435414-41102
161,The Little Owl,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Perched on a winsome corner of the West Village, Chef Joey Campanaro's The Little Owl continues to hold a dear place in the hearts of diners near and far who appreciate that simple food and great food can be one and the same. The broccoli soup (a pure, silky purée enriched with a trace of cream and crowned by a crouton of bubbling, aged cheddar) is among the best examples of this. The small corner room is quaint and despite this establishment's popularity, the service team is completely attitude-free. The wee kitchen is on display, and the focused crew turns out a rousing roster of preparations that may bear an affinity for Mediterranean cuisine such as seared cod with bagna cauda vinaigrette, and gravy meatball sliders, a hands-down house specialty.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-The_Little_Owl-185006-41102
162,Supper,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","Laid-back yet lively, this Italian paradise draws a refined crowd looking to while away a few lazy hours over great wine and even better bites. Seats up front offer prime views of an action-packed kitchen, while the back is best for intimacy and more sips from the impressive list. Fresh, thinly sliced squid quickly tossed in garlic, olive oil, lemon, parsley, and chili flakes is a study in the powers of simplicity; while strozzapretti with ""Dad's Sunday Marinara Sauce"" is an elevated rendition of the classic-finished with a mound of luscious ricotta. Even the plainest of pastas are enviably enriched here-imagine twirls of spaghetti al limone with a mountain of parmesan and black pepper. If you can save room, the tiramisu is light, fluffy, and molto buono!",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Supper-253702-41102
163,Narcissa,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"André Balaz's Standard East Village hotel is where you will find one of downtown's snazziest dining rooms. Richly stained wood furnishings in contrasting hues pair beautifully with tanned leather banquettes, sienna table linens, and perfectly calibrated lighting. The overall effect is warmer than a Malibu sunset. Chef John Fraser (of Dovetail) has assembled a formidable team to realize his vision of polished farm-to-table dining, starring seasonal produce from the Hudson Valley. Beets take a turn in the rotisserie oven and arrive for your pleasure as a warm salad with hearty bulgur, pickled cucumber, and a pool of horseradish cream. Poussin is roasted whole and set atop steel cut oats slicked with jus, spicy sausage, and oven-wilted radicchio.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10005-Narcissa-435804-41102

The scene spills out onto the sidewalk when the weather allows. Named for Barcelona's historic commercial thoroughfare, Las Ramblas is a tapas treat. A copper-plated bar and collection of tiny tables provide a perch for snacking on an array of earnestly prepared items. Check out the wall-mounted blackboard for especiales. Bring friends (it's that kind of place) to fully explore the menu which serves up delights such as succulent head-on prawns roasted in a terra-cotta dish and sauced with cava vinegar, ginger, and basil; or béchamel creamed spinach topped by a molten cap of Mahón cheese.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Las_Ramblas-185007-41102

Simple standard. Our best addresses.","Black walls surrounding two tiny windows form the façade of this surreptitious gem. Unlike the diverse neighborhood in which it resides, the décor inside the long room is simple and sleek, framed by low ceilings, curving bamboo slats, and close-knit tables. Servers are smartly attired if a little too-cool-for-school, but the passionate chefs here provide a wealth of culinary entertainment. This is a place where painstaking detail is evident from start to finish. A large square plate, for instance, may feature the likes of ruby-red tuna set beside soy-mirin sauce; an edible cup filled with a spicy salmon mixture; densely packed roe topped with bonito flakes; and a peppery watercress salad. Then, a thick cut of salmon marinated in three types of miso and cooked en papillote is unwrapped to reveal the most tender, moist, and flaky meat. And finally, each grain of slightly sticky rice in the sushi omakase is cooked perfectly and combined with fluke, Tasmanian trout, and creamy otoro. Young couples as well as die-hard downtowners idolize this ""jewel"" and for good reason-a dessert of green tea ice cream sandwiched between chocolate chip cookies is exemplary, delicious, and very, very special.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Jewel_Bako-70004-41102
166,Degustation,Cuisine Spanish,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"With its slate-tiled walls and cozy lighting, this well-loved tapas bar is of the most elegant degree-and a romantic escape from the fray for couples on date night. Counter seating surrounds the spotless and very serious kitchen of Chef Nicholas Licata, and dapper proprietor Jack Lamb is a colorful presence. The skillfully rendered and enticingly presented small plates are ever-evolving. Expect hot and crunchy croquetas oozing with mushroom-infused cream; or zesty boquerones dressed with yuzu peel and breadcrumbs. Sunchokes are roasted whole and sent forth with pumpernickel ""soil"" and an addictive mound of ""funyons."" For a fantastic finale, cubes of seared pineapple are composed with white chocolate sponge cake and intensely green lime granita.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Degustation-166747-41102
167,Clinton St. Baking Company,Cuisine American,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"What started as a bakery has become a legend-one that perpetually draws a crowd waiting for ample rewards. A little bit country and a little bit food lab, this brunch-focused bijou has achieved such success in NY that the owners now have outposts in Japan and Dubai. Service can struggle to keep up with the crowds, but the loud and lively dining room doesn't seem to notice. Breakfast for dinner is always a treat, especially when golden brown Belgian waffles are served with warm maple butter and topped with buttermilk-brined fried chicken for a flawless marriage of sweet and savory. Lighter but still lovely, chicken tortilla soup sees a pile of crunchy fried tortilla strips over hearty broth bobbing with carrots, celery, and shredded chicken.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10002-Clinton_St_Baking_Company-331694-41102
168,Risotteria Melotti,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"By specializing in risotto, this unique family-owned spot rises above the city's endless proliferation of Italian dining options. The Melotti family produces rice in Veneto and this stateside location is sister to Isola della Scala in Verona. Scenes from the film Riso Amaro on a mounted television add atmosphere to the rustic surrounds, where the air is filled with the sounds of stirring as each order is prepared. A bread basket stuffed with rice cakes precedes plates of risotto limone e gamberi made with lemon juice and studded with morsels of pan-seared shrimp. More complex risotti may be presented in a crispy Monte Veronese cheese cup and showcase Amarone wine. Here, each creamy and toothsome grain displays impressive technique.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Risotteria_Melotti-468064-41102
169,Perilla,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Low-key, casual, and classic, Perilla is simply a comfortable place to be-solo diners seek out the welcoming bar. Observe that the designer zebrawood tables are signed on the edge and then understand this place's level of care and dedication to detail. The subdued lighting, plush banquettes, and cream-colored walls lend a calm vibe despite the clubby music. The kitchen combines quality ingredients with experimental flair, resulting in dishes that are pleasing but sometimes overly complex. Sample pastas like house-made garganelli with smoky guanciale, paprika, spring onion, piney-crunchy fiddlehead fern, and sweet octopus. The Long Island duck breast is cooked to gorgeous pink and served with roasted beets and savory baklava layering duck confit and greens.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Perilla-185932-41102
170,Buvette,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Charming and proudly French, Buvette serves delicious Gallic plates to a notably svelte set. While carb addicts can barely fit into these wee seats, it's worth the squeeze for Chef Jody Williams' famously rustic cooking. Inside, everything comes alive with jazz and chatter. Instagrammable dishes take their cue from French classics and may feature crusty olive oil-drizzled country bread slathered with fluffy scrambled eggs, salty prosciutto, and nutty parmesan. Then await croissants-fresh, buttery, and flaky-served with sweet fruit preserves for a typically French and very decadent treat. If not up the block at her other spot or across the pond in Paris, you may even find the chef herself holding meetings over a potent, frothy, and flawless cappuccino.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Buvette-331686-41102
171,Tertulia,Cuisine Spanish,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Good standard.","With a Spanish soul and tastefully raw space, Chef Seamus Mullen's Tertulia is big-hearted and boasts a surprisingly healthy side to its menu. The narrow room decked with a long wood bar and colorful tiles evokes those casual eateries in Spain, rife with a buzzing open kitchen and chalkboards scribbled with cheeses. The bites here are healthy but equally bright with flavor. Tosta matrimonio is a flax and quinoa crisp topped with black and white anchovies, slow-roasted tomato, and sharp sheep's milk cheese. Also, try bocata de delicata, a satisfying sandwich of slices of charred delicata squash, roasted red peppers, Swiss chard, and cheddar cheese. For rotisserie fun or a perfect rib eye to grill on your rooftop, visit El Colmado Butchery in MePa.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Tertulia-360567-41102
172,Soto,Cuisine Japanese,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,"Two MICHELIN stars: exceptional cuisine. Worth a detour! 





Good standard.","Culinary dominance, unmistakable skill, and absolute discipline permeate every angle of this modest storefront. This is not some flashy temple to sushi, but rather an authentic and visually restrained rendering of a traditional Japanese restaurant. If the sterile look (with just blonde wood and bright lights to embellish) seems too antiseptic, then remember that Soto prides itself on precise preparations of luxurious raw seafood. While operational issues combined with lackluster service may have impacted guests' experiences of late, the cuisine of Chef Sotohiro Kosugi remains extraordinary-as long as you can tune out the flaws. Knife skills are paramount and every element is at its precise temperature, as these adept cooks coax each morsel of impossibly rich uni, served simply with uni powder, into a single bite that leaves a lasting impression. Composed dishes are not only strikingly beautiful, but an outright hit-imagine finely chopped and exceedingly silken toro tartare with avocado coulis, caviar, and chives accompanied by a sesame-ponzu sauce. And, unctuous fresh water eel combined with Tosa vinegar, smoky bonito flakes, and crisp Japanese cucumbers come together to form a neat but umami-rich finish.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Soto-208816-41102
173,Sobakoh,Cuisine Japanese,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"Before entering Sobakoh, stop for a minute to appreciate Chef/owner Hiromitsu Takahashi, sequestered in his temperature- and humidity-controlled glass booth, forming layers of organically grown buckwheat flour dough into first-rate noodles. This ritual is performed several times daily by the smiling chef and is the foundation of the seasonally arranged offerings at this Japan-meets-East Village soba spot. Service can be sluggish, so start with a classic snack, like the refreshing daikon salad dressed with yuzu, wasabi, and bonito flakes. Then dive into your bowlful of uni ikura soba- chilled buckwheat noodles heaped with creamy sea urchin and plump salmon roe. The inexpensive prix-fixe offered nightly is even cheaper before 7:00 P.M.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Sobakoh-208806-41102
174,annisa,Cuisine Fusion,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Anita Lo's menu is informed by her heritage and her peregrinations, and she clearly puts much effort into seeking out the best seasonal produce available. The Asian element of the fusion equation is quite pronounced yet there is also plenty of choice for those who prefer their influences to come from more Westerly cuisines. As a result, one can start with black sea bass sashimi with trout roe and follow it up, by way of contrast, with a ""tasting of lamb"" with cauliflower. Dishes are quite delicate creations and come with some flavor combinations that will certainly perk up your taste buds. The dining room exudes warmth; the service is self-assured and, given that annisa means ""women"" in Arabic, it is fitting that the wine list makes a point of featuring many female wine growers.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-annisa-67394-41102
175,Blue Hill,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Good standard.","Chef Dan Barber's iconic venue remains the paragon of farm-to-table dining in Manhattan by virtue of its seasonal lineup of pampered product. Everything on the menu is sourced from the Stone Barns Center (home to Blue Hill's Westchester farm) as well as a number of local producers. Blue Hill's intimate space has been hosting a devoted foodie following for an impressive 15-some years, and service in this former speakeasy-where fresh flowers and candlelight cast a romantic spell-is nothing less than excellent. The adept kitchen turns out contemporary cuisine, which in turn showcases the astounding quality stocked in the larder and allows vegetables to shine at all times. Asparagus spears are gently roasted to preserve their natural earthiness and coupled with vibrant beet yogurt as well as stinging nettles cream for a perfect balance in flavor. Then, moist striped bass draped atop fennel purée is decked with soft, sweet currants and toasted salty pine nuts to form a succulent and satisfying entrée. Familiar desserts highlight still more of the kitchen's best, as is the case with light and custard-y brioche bread pudding coupled with a quenelle of pleasantly bitter cocoa nib cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10011-Blue_Hill-69616-41102
176,Rockmeisha,Cuisine Japanese,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,,"Tightly-packed bar height tables fill this tiny izakaya-style restaurant, a quirky canteen with a menu designed for fun. The young crowd sips Sapporo or sake against a soundtrack of old school rock; and the décor, not far behind, ranges from vinyl records to a framed beer ad featuring Japanese women in bathing suits. The space is cramped yet fun, the atmosphere lively and loose. An appropriately moist leek omelet shows the kitchen's deft execution of simple dishes. Meaty, deep-fried chicken wings coated in a nose-tingling vinegar-based buffalo sauce are an optimal drinking accompaniment, as is a bowl of chashu ramen with milky pork bone broth, delicate noodles, pork belly, pickled ginger, sliced scallions, and a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Rockmeisha-257876-41102
177,The Mermaid Inn,Cuisine Seafood,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"This laid-back and inviting seafood spot has been a neighborhood favorite for over a decade now, spawning locations in Greenwich Village and the Upper West Side. A steady stream of guests lines the bar early in the week for Monday's all night happy hour with freshly shucked oysters, snack-sized fish tacos, and other specially priced bites. For a hearty plate after your nosh, try blackened catfish dotted with crawfish butter alongside hushpuppies, or the lobster roll with Old Bay fries. On Sunday nights, look out for lobsterpalooza-a whole lobster accompanied by grilled corn on the cob and steamed potatoes. At the end of your meal there's no need to deliberate over dessert. A demitasse of perfect chocolate pudding is presented compliments of the house.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-The_Mermaid_Inn-67278-41102
178,Panca,Cuisine Peruvian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"First thing's first: go to the impressive wood bar lined with bottles of pisco and grab a handful of the wickedly good roasted Peruvian corn. Then settle into the rather lively and colorful dining room, or just ogle at the many cebiche options on the menu, another hallmark of the cuisine. If you choose to sit outside, be prepared to give up the interior's cantina-like vibe. Explore the tiradito (think of it like cebiche's cousin), which highlight sashimi-like cuts of seafood like fluke, shrimp, and octopus served on a duo of peppery aji amarillo or rocoto sauces. Panca gives equal honor to those other pillars of its national cuisine, serving a cilantro-stewed chicken with pitch-perfect garlic rice and potatoes topped with salsa criolla.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Panca-257875-41102
179,Via Carota,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"An Italian eye for style and polished rusticity sit center stage at this sure-footed and fuss-free local favorite. From the warm dining room with whitewashed exposed brick walls and farmhouse tables to the marble bar, the artistic sensibility of Chefs/co-owners Rita Sodi and Jody Williams is evident before the meal even begins. Crostini are deceptively simple and flavorful, such as chicken livers folded with caramelized onions and sage generously spread over grilled sourdough bread. Fried green olives, pitted and stuffed with pork sausage arrive piping-hot and pleasing. Thick ribbons of pappardelle are a satisfying, chewy base for a hearty wild boar ragù. Bone-in fried rabbit is served with whole cloves of sweet and spreadable roasted garlic.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Via_Carota-468079-41102

Good standard.","Is Mario Batali's beloved wild child of the fine dining scene mellowing a bit with age? Only in the best possible way. This warm, inviting mainstay still likes to keep its elegant good looks edgy with a little thumping music, but the general vibe inside seems to have settled into a sweeter, calmer version of its rambunctious youth. Nestled into quaint Waverly Place, Babbo's bi-level dining room fits right in: think shuttered windows and wrought-iron railings alongside thick wooden armchairs, white tablecloths, and the kind of dreamy low lighting made for late night rendezvous. The food itself is always artful and precise, and the menu more than delivers on its promise: creative, rustic Italian fare made with stellar skill and extraordinary ingredients. Mainstays like a delicate lamb's tongue vinaigrette arrives humming with tender beech mushrooms and topped with a 3-minute egg and mâche; while soft beef cheek ravioli bathed in a Castelmagno cheese- and black truffle-reduction is subtle but wow-inducing. Don't skip dessert: when this hot spot takes a swing on a classic semifreddo, drenching it in dark chocolate and a dusting of crushed pistachio, it hits it out of the park.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10011-Babbo-67900-41102

Cafeteria-like service features cleaver-wielding cooks proffering pulled pork, ribs, and more. Selections are sliced, weighed, and piled high before you even make it to the sides and vats of house pickles. Go for the baked beans, made with black-eyed peas and meaty burnt ends for plenty of umami. The best reason to come here may be the wonderfully wobbly-tender brisket, pink-tinged with smoke and thinly crusted in spice.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Mighty_Quinn_s-399613-41102

Tuscan native Rita Sodi is out to change that with this trattoria.

Inside this oasis, Negronis prep palates for al dente rigatoni and hearty, meat-focused dishes like the coniglio in porchetta. This exceptional rabbit preparation combines bacon-wrapped loin with a sweet wine- rosemary- and garlic-sauce. The herbal quality of such savoriness brings out the almost austere nature of the lean rabbit, showing how truly intuitive and innovative Italian cooking can be.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-I_Sodi-435807-41102

Whitewashed brick walls, chili-red beams, an orange accent wall, and ebony furnishings detail the tidy space. Steer clear of the Chinese-American portion of the menu; instead, partake in the memorable house specialties featuring dried chilies, Sichuan peppercorns, and pickled peppers that singe with abandon. However, a handful of straightforward items do bring relief from the spicy onslaught, as in minced pork with pickled cabbage in a light, sour broth; chunks of dark and salty-sweet braised beef and potatoes; and myriad hotpots (a recent menu addition).

The clean, narrow space is bright and contemporary, with black tile walls and copper pots hanging from exposed brick. From the kitchen, tangra-style Calcutta-Chinese specialties are a new offering, however it is best to focus your attention on the preparations originating from the Southwest coast. Seafood and coconut factor heavily in Latta Shetty's shrimp ajadina, a dry-gravy stir-fry rich with red chillies and myriad spices. Chicken chutneywala is simmered in a bright yellow cream sauce seasoned with tart-sweet green mango chutney; and pumpkin sabji is another fantastic offering that also happens to be vegetarian.

This second-floor room may be plain, but is very tidy with tables dressed in colorful linens that pop against the brownish walls. Stir-fried and slow-cooked specialties are sought after here, as in the black pork curry featuring an ink-dark sauce of roasted spices, chilies, black pepper, ginger, and cloves. The string hopper kotthu is deliciously traditional, served as a fluffy heap of rice noodles sautéed with bits of white meat chicken and an array of fresh vegetables with a small dish of vibrant coconut curry. Alcohol is not served, but a number of soft drinks are offered and guests are welcome to bring their own wine or beer.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Sigiri-185099-41102

If the unusual menu and bland interior have you second-guessing yourself, have faith as the food will put those fears to rest soon enough. Kick things off with their spicy namesake hot pot, bubbling with plump ramen noodles, tender dumplings, bright vegetables, rich Berkshire pork belly and pigs feet.

The Eddy's menu defies easy categorization and offers cleverly constructed cooking. Fried beef tendons are a puffed and crunchy snack dabbed with charred onion cream and sweet trout roe. Delicate ricotta gnocchi with toasted hazelnuts showcases spring's sweet peas and pickled ramps, while golden spotted tile fish is seared and plated with squid ink Hollandaise, saffron broth, rice beans, and braised artichokes.

You might even adopt a drawl while reading through Root & Bone's pleasing menu. Grandma Daisy's warm angel biscuits are incredibly light and fluffy-especially alongside that salty-sweet, dark chicken-maple jus for dipping. The signature sweet tea-brined fried chicken is prepared in a designated corner of the room, filling the space with tempting aromas. Shrimp and grits with Virginia country ham has a Yankee touch thanks to the addition of Brooklyn lager to the sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Root_Bone-468065-41102

The menu rotates with the seasons, but standbys cannot be missed, like wild escarole salad with crisp leaves wilting in hot anchovy dressing; or huge rounds of anelloni tossed with spicy lamb sausage, peppery mustard greens, and breadcrumbs.

A semi-open kitchen, polished and gleaming with stainless steel, pushes out wickedly good Italian dishes like tender potato gnocchi in a rabbit cacciatore, laced with garlic, sweet tomato, rosemary and sage; or perfectly charred octopus paired with creamy potatoes spiked with chilies, olives and savory pancetta. Polish that off with a drink from their generous list of aperitivi or fantastic selection of wines by the glass, and you'll be feeling quite beautiful yourself by dinner's end.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-L_Artusi-257525-41102

From the antique mirrors to the nightly crowds, this contemporary American has nailed the heart and soul of Greenwich Village to become a regular spot for sipping well-sourced wines with friends and chomping down on wonderfully crisp rock shrimp fritters. The recognizable dishes are expertly prepared, fueled by top-notch ingredients and a kitchen that knows how to handle a pan-roasted chicken-arriving crisp-skinned and deliciously tender. Even humble Brussels sprouts get special treatment with a kick of sriracha. Finish it all off with monkey bread made with eggy-buttery brioche and a brilliantly subtle hint of maple.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Joseph_Leonard-331689-41102
193,Margaux,Cuisine Mediterranean,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard. Our best addresses.,"Calling all pretty young things: the fashionable Marlton Hotel is now home to one of the best bar-cum-restaurants around Washington Sq. Park. Walk through its posh lobby, past the sleek espresso station and massive wooden bar (complete with brass footrests-it's that kind of place), to enter Margaux, a 20th century-inspired Parisian bistro. The elegant, well-curated décor includes molded ceilings and floral tiles imported from Argentina, but you'll want to make a beeline for the dreamy, skylight-covered garden room. Settle in and order an innovative cocktail like the Artichoke Tea, a blend of Cynar, tea syrup, lemon, and cava, as well as a plate of juicy rotisserie chicken with smashed sweet potatoes, tangy urfa biber pepper, and powerful green harissa.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10011-Margaux-442176-41102
194,RedFarm,Cuisine Asian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"The hot spot for upscale (and of the moment) Chinese food, RedFarm packs in the flavor, the noise, as well as the people. On any given night, the line will snake out the door, and a wait is inevitable to score a seat at their communal table in this industrial space. It's worth any hassle, though, when you sit down to experience the farm-to-table, Asian-fusion concept from big names in the business like Joe Ng & Ed Schoenfeld. The freewheeling kitchen relishes experimenting with local ingredients. Try the bright green pea-leaf and shrimp dumplings, which stand out beautifully in their near-translucent casing; or wok-fried Dungeness crab and crawfish in a thick and spicy basil-ginger sauce. For some Peking duck fun, head downstairs to Decoy.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-RedFarm-366485-41102
195,Huertas,Cuisine Spanish,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"A festive spirit fronts this Basque country-inspired den, where pintxos are passed around in the bar. This is the kind of place that honors authentic sips like kalimotxo (red wine and cola), vermut (Catalan for vermouth), and sherry, so don't expect to see pitchers of sangria being bandied about. The proper dining room in the back is where the highly recommended tasting menu is served. This reasonably priced prix-fixe stimulates with small bites like sardine conserva served on buttered crostini with shaved radish; and may be followed by softly scrambled eggs drizzled with ruby shrimp jus, or seared lamb loin with greenmarket produce and crushed black olives. A chocolate custard topped with whipped cream and crushed Marcona almonds is heaven on a plate.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Huertas-442992-41102
196,Somtum Der,Cuisine Thai,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Simple standard.","Based in Bangkok, this concrete jungle outpost is doing a terrific job of presenting Thai cuisine that perfectly reflects the modern spirit of the Northeast Isaan region. Upon entering Somtum Der, a cozy enclave stylishly accented with bright pops of red, diners are greeted by a glimpse of the kitchen and its somtum station. There, contents from the large glass jars of nuts, dried red chilies, and spices are ground in a mortar and pestle to produce its eponymous dish-also referred to as the city's best green papaya salad(s). Order big here, as the portions aren't massive and the food is plain terrific. The kitchen is happy to kick things up a notch spice-wise, so be aggressive and request the hotter end of the spectrum for greater authenticity. The service staff here is both friendly and hospitable, so heed their advice and include in every meal an addictive skewer of Der's-style grilled sticky rice to go along with the likes of lip-smacking larb tod. Other highlights have included succulent deep-fried chicken thighs sprinkled with toasted garlic chips and accompanied by a pungent citrus-and-spice dipping sauce. Smoky-sweet moo ping kati sod-marinated, grilled, and coconut-glazed pork set over cool rice vermicelli-is gloriously succulent and particularly addictive.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Somtum_Der-441651-41102
197,The Bao,Cuisine Chinese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Trade the hustle and bustle of Chinatown for the equally boisterous St. Marks Place as a destination for excellent soup dumplings. This being the East Village, the dining room is chic but low-key with a pale earthy color scheme framing a communal table and metal chairs. As for the menu, the restaurant's name says it all: the bao is absolute perfection. Presented in a bamboo steamer with soy and vinegar dipping sauce, each parcel is artfully dimpled, delightfully toothsome, and plumped with tasty broth and seasoned meat. Save room for sampling some of their other delicious specialties, including julienned celery stalks stir-fried with dried tofu; diced chives tossed with ground pork and fermented black beans; or XO sauce-fried rice.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-The_Bao-468058-41102
198,Ramen Misoya,Cuisine Japanese,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"With 30 locations worldwide, Ramen Misoya brings its trademark ambrosial bowlfuls to New York City. The earthy dining area dons a bamboo-lined ceiling as well as a TV monitor that is internally looped to broadcast the kitchen's every move. The ramen offering here differentiates itself by centering on a trio of miso-enriched broths: shiro is a white miso fermented with rice koji (starter); kome-miso is richer tasting; and mame-miso is a strictly soybean product. The mouth-coating soup is delicious alchemy. Each slurp is a multifaceted distillation of pork and chicken bones with savory-salty-sweet notes, stocked with excellent noodles, vegetables, and the likes of panko-crusted shrimp tempura, fried ginger chicken, or slices of house-made cha-su.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Ramen_Misoya-360550-41102
199,Sushi Dojo,Cuisine Japanese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Chef David Bouhadana follows up his stint at Sushi Uo and some time in Japan to head up this winning sushi-ya. A 14-seat counter and handful of tables outfit this pleasant room, where the congenial chef sends forth an impressive array of morsels. The chef's choice menu is highly recommended and offers good value for the masterful skill and high quality of fish. This is immediately clear in the nigiri presentation that has included Tasmanian trout, cherry salmon from Japan, and a trio of maguro (lean, medium, and fatty). Beyond the sushi menu, sample dishes like house-made cold tofu served with yuzu salt; and kaki-age, a light and crisp tempura-fried combination of delicate mizuna, seaweed, squid, and shrimp with green-tea salt.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Sushi_Dojo-404289-41102

Along with upbeat tunes and ever-flowing Mezcal, this restaurant has as much spirit as it does spice. Of course, the flavor is abundant in dishes that can be terrifically delicious (if equally messy to eat). The sopes are a must, perhaps filled with enticingly salty and tasty refried black beans and a poached quail egg. Outrageously good queso melts Chihuahua cheese with any of the four toppings, especially the green chorizo, for pure gooey pleasure. Don't miss house salsas like smoked cashew or tomatillo-chipotle, even if it means paying extra as they're worth every penny!",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Empellon_Taqueria-331687-41102

Good standard.","In the basement level of a classic walk-up smack in the midst of a hip-artsy downtown neighborhood, Kyo Ya looks and feels like a secret hideaway cloaked in undulating wood and dark slate. The height of professionalism and hospitality, the staff is not merely attentive but appreciative of your presence at their table-or perhaps at one of the prized chef's counter stools for kaiseki dining, where mesmerizing craft is exhibited. This is a place where traditional cuisine is prepared with modern flair, and Japanese is the moneyed clientele's mother tongue. Refinement pervades every element of every dish, like the delicate, slightly tart pickled cabbage potage with chewy tri-colored taro root-potato dango and pale green strips of simmered vegetables finished with a dab of miso. The sashimi of the day may feature a fresh oyster with sautéed onion and yuzu kosho oroshi swimming in ponzu; simmered firefly squid and celery topped with salty karashi-miso and pickled plum; or tender raw octopus. Clay pots reveal fragrant dashi cooked with woodear mushooms, carrots, turnips, and bobbing with a tiny melting ball of excellent mozzarella as well as the quenelle-like shrimp dumpling, ebishinjo.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Kyo_Ya-185909-41102
202,Perry Street,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"All New York gastronauts will be familiar with the Vongerichten name but it's actually Jean-Georges' son Cédric who heads up the kitchen here. The restaurant is on the first floor of the Richard Meier Towers and, if you stretch, you can just about see the Hudson outside. The room is bright, open, and contemporary although the anodyne muzak suggests a lack of faith in their customers' ability to create their own atmosphere or an acknowledgment of the room's lack of warmth. The influences on the food are largely French and American with the occasional Asian note. The combinations on the plate are nothing too challenging; dishes are colourful; and the flavors pronounced. The great value lunch menu should make it far busier during the day than it is.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Perry_Street-122745-41102
203,Tuome,Cuisine Fusion,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Chef Thomas Chen's intimate venue flaunts petite East Village bones, a warm glow cast over the hip crowd, and a too-loud playlist that may cause indigestion for anyone older than a Millenial. Asian accents filtered through the mind of this chef (who spent time behind the line at Eleven Madison Park) reveal a playful lineup. Treviso spears are brushed with creamy Caesar dressing and plated with warm, buttery croutons, clementine segments, and toasted sunflower seeds. Black bass is expertly seared and sauced with New England-style clam chowder pocked with Chinese sausage and perfectly complemented by a side of banana leaf-wrapped sticky rice enriched with duck fat. If you still have room for dessert, order the hot, crisp, and mildly sweet Chinese beignets.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Tuome-468067-41102

This generous feast features a bowl of green tea noodles in hot, crystal-clear dashi stocked with wilted water spinach and fish cake, accompanied by lean tuna chirashi, yellowtail, and kanpyo. The ten-don, a jumbo shrimp tempura served over rice, is just as enticing. The à la carte offerings draw crowds seeking delish sushi as well as a host of tasty cooked preparations; a Twilight menu is nice for early birds. The dining room has a clean and spare look, with seating available at a number of wood tables or sizable counter.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Hasaki-67266-41102
205,Fedora,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"An ode to the New York old guard, Fedora still attracts the creative, the moneyed and the young. It's a sort of dreamlike supper club where well-crafted cocktails flow into endless conversations, the words absorbed into the crevices of the original carved wooden bar as they have for generations. No longer a renowned literati haunt, Fedora remains an attractive homage to the Village of yore. Tuck your bag and coat into the cubby above the banquette and set off on an adventure in contemporary cuisine, one that mixes barbecue cream with smoked salmon and highlights the distinctive wines of Jura. This builds to the excellent and gargantuan crispy duck with perfectly lacquered skin accented by a date-barbecue sauce that's pure hedonistic inspiration.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Fedora-331688-41102

Simple standard.","Headed by a duo of young Korean-born chefs who met at the Culinary Institute of America and put their education to work in the stellar kitchens of Bouley and Gramercy Tavern, Oiji dishes out an updated take on Korean flavors. The intimate dining room is small and moodily lit, with an open kitchen that allows diners to see and hear the action as it takes place. Polished and refined yet familiar, the concise menu of small plates offers an appealing approach. Decadently rich and creamy, the wild sesame soup-a dairy-free sensation-is poured over wild mushrooms, chewy rice cake, and black truffle. Pine smoke-infused mackerel is served with a wedge of lemon and yuzu-soy sauce to brighten the fragrant and oily-rich fish. Of course, the kimchi is not to be missed.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Oiji-474814-41102
207,Mary's Fish Camp,Cuisine Seafood,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"This West Village seafood shack is much more than just a destination for lobster rolls. Located on an irresistibly cute corner with large windows, Mary's Fish Camp tempts with creative daily specials scrawled on a chalkboard, sweet and briny raw offerings, and nostalgic desserts like hot fudge sundaes. Crowds pack into the curving stainless steel counter while white, lazy fans spin overhead. The summery space offers lots of choice, but the lobster roll should not be overlooked. A toasted bun is overflowing with hunks of tender, sweet meat dressed in the perfect proportion of mayonnaise and lemon juice, with a mountain of shoestring fries on the side. Begin the meal with spicy Key West conch chowder and then end with a slice of Americana-banana cream pie.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Mary_s_Fish_Camp-68084-41102
208,Pylos,Cuisine Greek,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Restaurateur Christos Valtzoglou has found the winning formula with this longstanding hideaway. Although his Heartbreak and Boukies may be faded memories, Pylos continues to sparkle as brightly as the Aegean Sea on a summer day. Taking its name from the Greek translation of ""made from clay,"" this contemporary taverna features a ceiling canopy of suspended terra-cotta pots dressing up a room with whitewashed walls and lapis-blue insets. Pale-green stemware and stark white crockery are used to serve Greek wines and a menu of rustic home-style cooking. Gigantes are baked in honey-scented tomato-dill sauce; grilled marinated octopus is drizzled with balsamic reduction; and anginares moussaka is a creamy vegetarian take on the classic made with artichokes.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Pylos-270919-41102
209,Lavagna,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"The little menu at this neighborhood fixture proves that quality trumps size. Lavagna's kitchen is snug but still manages to make ample use of a wood-burning oven to bake everything from delicate pizette to whole roasted fish. Pastas are always a treat, while other tasty options can include pan-fried smoked scamorza paired with a roasted red pepper crostini, juicy rack of lamb, or a slice of spot-on crostata filled with seasonal fruit and dressed with caramel sauce. Framed mirrors, a pressed-tin ceiling, and candlelight produce a mood that is almost as warm as the genuinely gracious service, which ensures that regulars receive the royal treatment. That said, everyone who steps through these doors feels welcome and well taken care of.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Lavagna-69115-41102

That country's proximity to Russia, Turkey, and Armenia results in a vibrant and enticingly diverse cuisine that Oda House does proud. A liberal use of fragrant spices, cheese-filled breads, kebabs, and slow-cooked meats typify the kitchen's preparations. Classic dishes include satsivi, boiled chicken served cool in a creamy walnut sauce seasoned with warm spices, accompanied by gomi, hominy grits in a mini cauldron studded with morsels of rich, stretchy sulgani cheese. Balance out the hearty fare with a fresh, perfectly dressed garden salad. The vibe is simple and rustic with pumpkin-stained stucco walls, exposed brick, and wood furnishings.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Oda_House-404288-41102

Headed by a trio of Per Se veterans, Noreetuh features an intimate setting of two slender dining rooms adorned with hexagonal mirrors and shelving units used to store bottles from the impressive wine list. Bigeye tuna poke strewn with seaweed, diced macadamia nuts, and pickled jalapeños is just one of the delicious highlights on offer, while plump shrimp seasoned with crushed garlic and arranged over a bed of sticky rice and baby romaine is another fine choice. For dessert, the signature take on bread pudding boasts caramelized slices of custard-soaked King's Hawaiian bread with rum raisins and a knockout scoop of pineapple ice cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Noreetuh-472165-41102

With its faux-farmhouse décor and rather bucolic corner location, it is a go-to neighborhood haunt. Happy hour specials bring them in, but the bar bites make them stay. Every dish on the menu is pleasing, from the buttery lobster puffs perched on champagne cream to the perfectly crafted Mongolian dumplings, full of spicy lamb, cabbage, and onion with a cool soy-lime dipping sauce. The lovely farfalle with fresh favas, sunchoke, spring onion, and chili is bound by a sprinkling of nutty Parmigiano. Top it off with deliciously simple desserts, like a wedge of ricotta cheesecake and a properly poached Bosc pear.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Left_Bank-360563-41102

Still, no one comes here to be surprised. Rather, they are plowing through their favorite renditions of paella, ranging from vegetable to seafood with chicken and chorizo. The paella Valenciana also adds clams, mussels, and lobster claws. Prices are low, portions are large, and lively crowds are always happy. Dishes are made to order, so if that arroz con pollo takes 30 minutes to get to your table, know that it will be worthy of the wait. It arrives as a massive amount of saffron-tinged rice and tender bone-in chicken dotted with green onions, pepper strips, lots of garlic, chorizo, and peas. Come dessert, you cannot go wrong with the flan.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Sevilla-68089-41102

It's the friendly corner spot with a marble bar where you can sip a glass of Nebbiolo and chat with the chefs, or simply dine solo on bowls of fresh pasta. The bells and whistles are here with squid ink spaghettini with mosciame or air-dried tuna (a specialty of Sardinia); and tripe ragù over tagliatelle. But creative dishes, like giardiniera-laced beef tartare also star, as a tangy twist on the traditional. Speaking of twists, affogato offers quite the kick with ice cream that is ""choked"" with sherry, amaro, or rye whiskey and then drizzled with a shot of espresso.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Spasso-331691-41102

The energy is high, but so are the standards for their expertly grilled meats and vegetables. Kneeling cooks use long wooden paddles to deliver dishes hot off the robata, like gyu tataki, seared beef filet topped with tobiko and scallions on a bed of red onions with ponzu.

Aged in-house for six weeks, the USDA Prime Porterhouse is presented hot off the grill but well rested, richly flavored, tender, and juicy.

Good standard.","There are some foods that just feel right at certain times of the year. When the nights draw in and there's a little chill in the air, there are certain words whose very presence on a menu summon feelings of comfort and warmth-and those words surely include spaetzle, schnitzel, and strudel. Austrian cuisine is known for being hearty and immeasurably satisfying, but the great strength of Wallsé is that you don't have to have spent the day skiing in Innsbruck to appreciate its cuisine because the adept kitchen has a lightness of touch and is not rigidly tied to tradition. Whether you've chosen the loin of venison with bone marrow or have gone for the tafelspitz, you'll find the dishes are nicely balanced and effortlessly easy to eat. The restaurant is divided into two rooms, both dominated by striking paintings, some of which are of the chef himself. The clientele is a largely sophisticated bunch with an inherent understanding of how restaurants work which, in turn, creates an easy, relaxing atmosphere.

Open from morning to night, breakfast offers the likes of eggs any style sided by hummus and tabouli, whereas afternoon fare may include tasty specials like bastilla or harira-the hearty and fragrant soup. Chicken tagine is excellent: try it with fluffy couscous and charmoula, a spicy green herb sauce, or order it Casablanca-style with chickpeas, raisins, and onions.

But as popular as the restaurant (and now the gastropub trend itself) has grown, Bloomfield's cooking has always been the real draw. And, it doesn't matter if you are teetering on a wooden stool, knocking elbows with pencil-thin hipsters all night in this cozy, bi-level space. With food like this, you might as well be on the moon. Bloomfield has made her name on those outstanding burgers, pan-seared mackerel, and legendary gnudi (feather-light orbs of ricotta ""gnocchi"" laced with brown butter, crispy sage, and nutty parmesan) but you really can't miss on this menu. Kick things off with a small plate of fresh, creamy burrata and grilled sourdough, spread with fava, mint, and a few chili flakes; and then move on to a perfectly roasted poussin, served with Sherry vinegar, grilled ramps, and delicate spring onions.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Spotted_Pig-69541-41102

Fresh flowers, blue-velvet barstools, and canvas paintings make it the perfect fusion of casual and classy; rock music lightens the mood. Pristine olive oils march from the kitchen as if to whet the appetite for a parade of Mediterranean classics to pair with food-friendly Italian wines. Start with butternut squash ravioli bathed in brown butter-mascarpone sauce, or the beautifully textured halibut on herbed tomato carpaccio for an instant return to summer. Roasted Brussels sprouts combine with caramelized apples to cut the enticing richness of fatty pancetta.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Extra_Virgin-70636-41102
224,Kura,Cuisine Japanese,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Simple standard.,"Set among a stretch of storefronts is this plain white façade that is so discreet, it actually stands out and grabs your attention. Hidden within is a hangout favored by a predominantly Japanese clientele crowded at the counter. Chef Norihiro Ishizuka runs the show, jovially engaging with his guests while slicing, forming, torching, and rolling. The only option here is omakase and diners choose their preference from three price points. Begin a meal here with sushi, which at times might be loosely formed, but the fish is of irreproachable quality and the experience absolutely special. Recent delights have included torched mackerel hako nigiri, a live prawn followed by its crispy deep-fried head, a heap of tiny raw sakura ebi, and a tuna hand roll to finish.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Kura-476455-41102
225,Morandi,Cuisine Italian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"From first sight, this prominent West Village location does much to resemble a farmhouse or cantina. Wood panels, antique tiles, tin ceilings, and shelves displaying straw-covered bottles of Chianti conjure an American's idyllic dream of Italy. The food is a more genuine reflection. Decadent beginnings might include tart and very crisp fried olives stuffed with meat. Plates of fried artichokes brightened with preserved lemon are unmissable, especially when paired with a choice of hand-stretched focaccia. Long twists of busiate al ragù di pesce spada are tossed with swordfish and excellent spicy almond pesto. Nightly specials showcase the likes of vitello alla Milanese with a crust so perfect and piping-hot, that it threatens to shatter with a fork.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Morandi-185005-41102
226,Kajitsu,Cuisine Japanese,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Good standard.","It's the way of the modern world that we think of the changing of the seasons more in terms of our wardrobe rather than our food-but a meal at Kajitsu could change that. This Japanese vegan restaurant serves shojin cuisine based on the precepts of Buddhism-if you're in search of an antidote to the plethora of steakhouses in the city, this is it. The second floor, traditionally decorated space is a sanctuary of peace and tranquility and offers table or counter seating and service that is as charming as it is earnest. Such is the skill of the kitchen you'll forget in no time about the absence of fish or meat. It's all about balance, harmony and simplicity-and allowing the ingredients' natural flavors to shine, whether it's the delicate onion soup with mizuna and potato, or the visually arresting hassun which could include everything from mountain yam to burdock root. Your period of contemplation and newfound respect for your fellow man may come to a juddering halt when you find yourself back on Lexington but, for a few moments at least, you'll feel you connected with nature.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10016-Kajitsu-258383-41102

Just a few doors east of its former location, this room boasts a fresh and tidy look with blonde wood seating plus signature red vinyl stools. An array of pots remain bubbling and steaming behind the counter. Rest assured the menu's star attraction-those thin and toothsome ramen noodles-are just as delicious, served with four near-addictive, fantastically complex broth variations: shio, shoyu, miso, and curry.

228,Curry-Ya,Cuisine Japanese,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"Complex, warming, and perfumed with fruity sweetness, slow-cooked wafuu (or Japanese-style) curry is a highly popular national treat. Tantalizingly draped over a mound of steamed short grain rice, each bowl calls for one of the kitchen's tasty embellishments such as panko-crusted fried shrimp, pan-fried hamburger steak, Berkshire pork, or chicken katsu. The brief menu also offers inspiring starters like flavor-packed tofu skin and green bean salad tossed with parmesan and a crushed-olive dressing. Brought to you by Bon Yagi (also of Rai Rai Ken, a few doors away), this local jewel has 14-seats along a white marble counter lined with bowls of pickles and dried onion flakes.

Good standard.","Boasting soothing textured walls the color of sand, sturdy but comfortable furnishings, and cool slate flooring, thisserene and serious space is just what one would expect of a high-end Japanese dining room. But, beyond this quotidian look is a kitchen that turns out very exciting-and quite unexpected-food. Tables are an available option, but a seat facing Chef Toshio Tomita at the pristine elm counteris the place to be. While the menu offers both à la carte dining and a sushionly omakase, the Chef's Counter omakase is by far the best experience to be had here. This meal begins with a playful platter of bites (envision smoked ham katsu) to break the ice and stimulate the palate for the kitchen's sparkling sashimi. Slices of Hokkaido octopus, marinated bonito, and snapper are a treat, dressed not only with freshly ground wasabi root and top-notch soy sauce, but also the chef's signature chimichurri-a touch of fusion that signals his decade-plus years of working at Nobu. Another highlight is the chilled handmade soba served with spicy buckwheat sprouts and a divine dipping sauce. Cooked dishes, like fried soft-shell crab with watermelon salad, and impressive nigiri round out Cagen's kappo-style meal.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Cagen-441648-41102

Feeding a pack of 20 on newspaper-wrapped tables are Indian-inspired sweet and savory small plates of watermelon and feta salad cooled by a vibrant mint sorbet; eggplant buns spiked with toasty cumin; green mango paneer; and a zucchini-hummus pizza.

Find foodies centered around a dining counter that juts out from the kitchen-a handful of small tables also bolster the accommodations. A unique array of small plates includes buffalo mozzarella with uni and yuzu foam, and steamed buns filled with Berkshire pork belly. Meanwhile, entrées go on to include miso-glazed cod set atop an appealing wild mushroom risotto fortified by a poached egg.

Very good standard.","Warm, personable, and genuine, Gotham Bar and Grill has everything a New York restaurant needs to stand the test of time. Inside, find towering floral arrangements and lofty ceilings hung with massive fabric-draped fixtures, which soften the room's appearance. The interior is vast, but the sunken dining area, elevated bar, and smartly divided room feel more classic than overdone. The service team exemplifies on-the-ball excellence. This kitchen's distinctive American seasonal cooking is in clear balance from start to finish. Begin with the simple-sounding tuna tartare combining chopped yellowfin and shiso surrounded by Japanese cucumber, enlivened with miso-ginger vinaigrette. Move on to explore seasonal risotto, showcasing wintery mushrooms or perhaps a summery feast of sweet shrimp, chives, and touch of tomato. Batter-fried soft-shell crabs are a feat of technical perfection, with body and crisped legs set over sautéed vegetables and a light citrus-soy reduction. Desserts alone are worth a visit, especially to indulge in the famously dense chocolate cake, served warm with a scoop of luscious salted-almond ice cream and cracked cocoa nibs.

A longtime favorite, this staff and the kitchen have their choreography down. Of course the smoky chipotle-laced guacamole is a necessary way to start the meal. Some dishes show Peruvian twists, like jalapeño-soy dressed tuna ceviche with pickled watermelon; as well as Thai basil-jalapeño ocopa sauce, a Peruvian tradition, to accompany those thin and crisp butternut squash-and-Manchego empanadas. Don't leave without trying the wow-inducing panko-coated watermelon fries and poblano-infused tomato ketchup.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Yerba_Buena_Perry-288675-41102

Every seat is filled nightly, surrounding the large team at work. Soft lighting highlights the texture of exposed brick walls to moody effect, and a thumping playlist says downtown-albeit too loudly. A sushi tasting and sushi kaiseki are the only options offered yet diners will not be left wanting. While the latter is a fuller experience working in an abundance of flavors like pan-seared squab breast, the tasting is a slightly streamlined and more rewarding choice. Regardless of your decision, a morsel of toothsome house-made mochi, dabbed with toasty pistachio miso, is a delightfully enticing opener.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Shuko-468066-41102

Good standard.","David Chang's beloved Ko has packed up its 600-square-foot tasting course concept and moved a few blocks south. Down a quiet alley and behind a door sporting his proverbial peach, you'll find the handsome new digs: a street-hip space sporting 40 seats, 22 of them surrounding the open kitchen via a U-shaped counter made of smooth black walnut. Much else remains the same. Per the old rules, there is no à la carte-only the multicourse menu for the evening (which you're given in print before you go). Then, dishes are delivered by the chefs themselves, who briefly describe each ingredient; while servers slip seamlessly between guests, changing silver and filling drinks. Chang is a veritable rock star chef by any standard (and his longtime lieutenant Sean Gray is the chef's equivalent of Keith Richards), so you're in expert hands from the start. Fresh, sweet sea bream is bound by translucent grated yam with fragrant shiso and pops of finger lime; and tender beef tartare is paired with cream of oyster as well as crushed popcorn. Delicate kabocha squash tortellini arrives with shaved parmesan and agrodolce; and a perfectly seared slice of venison is paired with silky potatoes and earthy Époisses.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Momofuku_Ko-231356-41102

Also find a generous listing of plump, briny oysters; starters such as wakasagi tempura (fried baby smelts) sprinkled with green tea-salt; and a handful of cooked entrées. The value-conscious omakase is highly recommended.

A honey-toned temple of updated comfort food, decked with blonde wood counters and a sparkling open kitchen, the service here may be brisk. But rest assured, as the menu is gutsy and molded with Asian street food in mind. Those steamed buns have amassed a gargantuan following thanks to decadent fillings like moist pork loin kissed with Hollandaise and chives. Additionally, that bowl of springy noodles doused in a spicy ginger-scallion sauce is just one instance of the crew's signature work. Korean fried chicken with seasonal greens is fit for a king; while more modest items, including desserts like candy apple truffle, are beautifully crafted and rightfully elevated to global fame.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Momofuku_Noodle_Bar-69116-41102

Bare wood tables; large, framed windows for people-watching; low lighting; and exposed brick walls all lend a hand in creating that perfect osteria vibe. As if that weren't enough to sustain a loyal following, Malaparte takes its home-style Italian cooking to the next level. Try one of the excellent pizza specials; the dadi di tonno scottato, a dish of wildly fresh seared tuna tossed in avocado-sesame dressing; the bang-on lasagna Bolognese, a silky version of this classic dish boasting an exquisitely good veal and pork ragù; or the melt-in-your-mouth chocolate mousse.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Malaparte-404294-41102
240,Colonie,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Hip and lively (both the crowd and the green wall of lush plants that is), this is a buzzing retreat for taking in all that makes Brooklyn so enticing. There is the exposed brick dining room and the ceilings of distressed wood, of course, along with the requisite long bar and perhaps most important, a sharp crowd who give Colonie its measured dose of cool. Start with crostini, perhaps laden with egg salad, a ribbon of lardo and drizzle of veal jus. A deeply nutty rye berry ragout brings together crispy mushrooms, cabbage, and a perfectly fried duck egg. Opt for the whole market fish, served deboned with tart and herbaceous salsa verde, crisp garlic, and roasted lemon. Be sure to save room for warm, yeasty sugar donuts stuffed with Chantilly cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11201-Colonie-331710-41102
241,Cacio e Pepe,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"This charming Italian gioia has welcomed diners for more than a decade now. But in relaying its pleasures, one must begin with the eponymous house specialty. This fresh tonnarelli tossed with pasta water, olive oil, cracked black pepper, and a showering of pecorino is pure delight. Those willing to branch out will find other pasta dishes here as equally pleasing, like the maltagliati dressed with a savory monkfish ragù revved up with olives, capers, and an unexpected hit of ginger. Mussels in black pepper ""soup"" is a savory bowl of mollusks and broth with garlicky croutons for soaking up the enticingly salty liquid. Exposed brick and wood furnishings complement the zucca-orange walls lined with wine bottles offered on the all-Italian list.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Cacio_e_Pepe-122701-41102
242,Edi & The Wolf,Cuisine Austrian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Chefs Eduard Frauneder and Wolfgang Ban are the dynamic duo behind this downtown facsimile of a heuriger- basically a casual neighborhood wine tavern popular throughout Austria. The dark and earthy den is chock-full of reclaimed materials including a 40-foot rope salvaged from a church, now coiled above the tiny bar. The crux of the offerings is comprised of small and shared plates such as cured and dried landjäger sausage, accompanied by house-made mustard and pickles. Entrées fall under the heading of ""schnitzel & co."" and offer a highly recommended wiener schnitzel, which starts with a pounded filet of heritage pork encased in an incredibly delicate and crunchy coating, finished with an Austrian-style potato salad and lingonberry jam.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Edi_The_Wolf-335721-41102

Also the co-founder of Uma Temakeria, Chef Chris Jaeckle pulls influence from all sorts of lands far and near, surprising customers with every new visit.Dinner might kick off with creamy hamachi crudo, sporting curls of crispy carrot and a fresh kick of peperoncino oil; and then move on to a nest of al dente bucatini twirled with uni, spicy breadcrumbs, and tarragon.

244,Hibino,Cuisine Japanese,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"The team at this demure retreat isn't constrained by a menu. Instead, diners are greeted by servers bearing blackboards that list the day's offerings. The list of obanzai (Kyoto-style tapas) are enticing and include marinated, fried chicken thigh with tartar sauce, grilled pork sausage, or roasted oysters with spicy gazpacho. The kitchen's regional dedication is also evident in its offering of Osaka's traditional hako sushi. This box-pressed preparation might be served as a layering of quality rice, shiso, kanpyo (preserved gourd), and salmon. Meanwhile, lunch is a concise affair that reveals either a bento box or platter of nigiri accompanied by a neatly stuffed futomaki. Of course, if lunch seems limited, come back for dinner when the kitchen truly shines.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11201-Hibino-360802-41102
245,The Place,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Set deep within the West Village, The Place is the kind of cozy, grotto-style den that makes you feel all grown-up. Rendezvous-like, guests climb below street level to find a bar aglow with flickering votive candles. Wander back a bit, and you'll find rustic beams and white tablecloth seating; two outdoor terraces beckon when the sun shines. The guileless name of this ""place"" and timeless look of its century-old setting is nicely juxtaposed by a wholly American menu that roams from east to west: duck confit-filled parcels with grain mustard and braised red cabbage is a lovely autumnal treat, while entrées please year-round with dishes like a cheddar-capped Shepherd's pie; Long Island duck breast with tamarind sauce; and Cuban-style pork chops.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-The_Place-68087-41102

Inside and out, a buzzy vibe seems to extend from the semi-open kitchen to the small bar. Service is genuine and warm; decorative mirrors make the most of the diminutive space, accented with tall wood-framed windows. Dishes are inventive, often deliciously riffing on the familiar. For a fun twist on wings, try the crispy, soft-centered ""Buffalo"" sweetbreads with a blue di bufala dip and pickled celery. Raw snapper is topped with grated bottarga and pickled onion, served alongside crispy oyster fritters. Heartier dishes include fresh-cut spaghetti with sweet shrimp, tomato, chili, and sea urchin or venison loin-stuffed cabbage.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Recette-280123-41102
247,Feast,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"This recent arrival with the straightforward but promising moniker is a rustic, textbook amalgam of wood, brick, and tiles. The kitchen is confidently led by an alum of Veritas who has devised several prix-fixe menus, served family-style. These might be based on the farmer's market or even a nose-to-tail meal of lamb, including merguez stew; and a lasagna layering shank, broccoli rabe, and goat cheese. If you're not up for a whole feast, dine à la carte on meaty, ocean-fresh oysters capped by cocktail sauce aspic; or a nouveau take on incredibly tender chicken and ""dumplings"" of liver-stuffed pan-fried gnocchi and wisps of crisped skin. End with the awesome Valrhona chocolate pudding-leaving a single dark chocolate cookie crumb behind is impossible.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Feast-399610-41102
248,Flinders Lane,Cuisine International,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Two Melbourne natives bring Australian dining to the East Village with this whimsical bistro. Flinders Lane hosts a convivial set in a petite room that's trademark downtown, with its mix of industrial and rustic touches. A strong Asian accent is woven throughout the menu, which also hails inspiration from Australia's Greek and Italian immigrants. Moist seaweed combined with avocado, snake beans, and roasted red pepper is a pop of flavors, brightened by a soy sauce- and toasted sesame oil-dressing. Grilled naan with tandoori-style rabbit is especially tasty thanks to its marinade of spiced yogurt and quick-pickled green mango garnish. And for as refreshing a dessert as you're likely to ever come across, order the coconut jelly with watermelon.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Flinders_Lane-442991-41102
249,Cafe Cluny,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This warm and cozy café flaunts its feminine persona with more than a touch of Village cool (and some occasional aloofness). There are ample windows for people-watching, or let your eyes wander to the botany drawings along the walls and bird sculptures decorating nooks. The Cluny burger accompanied by golden fries is a sure-fire hit; it arrives topless to showcase the perfectly charred and glistening meat. Once fully dressed with your choice of bib lettuce, tomato, and red onion slices, it literally drips with goodness-maybe right onto those beautifully crisped fries. Come dessert, go for a simple and outrageously good plate of biscotti, served in a ""jenga"" arrangement of bittersweet chocolate and walnut or pistachio and anise flavors.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Cafe_Cluny-185009-41102

Blue chairs pop against all the wood and brick, bringing a Mediterranean feel to the intimate space. Banquettes line one side of the restaurant, suggesting cozy evenings of sharing coca de atùn (flatbread pizza) or pan tomate.Empanadas are flaky and crusty, filled with thyme-laced beef, spring onion, allspice, and cheese. Classic croquetas are crackling outside and creamy within, resting on a dab of aïoli. But such snacks are just a prelude to the excellent paella; choose one version studded with shellfish and sweet peppers, or mix and match two or three different ""flavors."" Crusty churros finish off an evening of pure Spanish pleasure.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Barraca-399620-41102

Carnations and votive candles pretty the room. Begin a meal with an assortment of air-dried or smoked meats and tall slices of savory pies like the gibanica stuffed with tart feta layered in excellent phyllo. Other authentic and hearty treats include c'evapi (grilled minced meat kebabs) as well as wonderfully rustic stews combining lamb and wilted spinach, or beans with smoked baby back ribs.

252,Motorino,Cuisine Pizza,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"What started out as a Neapolitan-style pizzeria in Brooklyn has grown into a global chain with locations in Hong Kong and Manila. Cloaked in the scent of wood-fired pies, Motorino is praised as an all-day spot that's easy on the wallet. True, it may be smaller than the newer, slightly grander Williamsburg outpost, but these pizzas leave nothing to be desired. Blackboard specials convey the product-focused sensibilities that begin with a lunchtime prix-fixe pairing a green salad of mint, beet greens, and red onion in balsamic vinaigrette with a perfectly charred and chewy pie. The foundation of each pizza is its outstanding crust spread with crushed tomatoes, gobs of melting fresh mozzarella, and perhaps a generous layering of spicy sausage slices.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Motorino-366473-41102
253,Blenheim,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"When a restaurant sources ingredients from its own farm in the Catskills, it clearly takes its farm-to-table ethos to heart. Even the décor here at Blenheim reflects this philosophy by way of distressed wood paneling and a style that is far more country-cool than precious. Service is eager and just as committed to the chef's mission of presenting pure ingredients with progressive elegance. There may be no more genuine expression of this kitchen than the farm eggs, their yolk bright orange and fresh, set beside gently charred slices of hangar steak and fork-tender fingerlings. Silky foie gras torchon is finished tableside with refreshing tomato water; and dense, creamy quadrello di bufala with pistachio sable is a welcome stand-in for an arid bread pudding.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-Blenheim-468077-41102

There's perfectly sourced charcuterie and a lovely raw bar to kick things off, but don't leave without moving on to Chang's legendary pork buns-pillow-soft and laced with hoisin sauce, cucumber, and scallions. Or even a tender Flat Iron steak, grilled to perfection, and paired with chicharrón chips, ramps, and broiled asparagus tips.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Momofuku_Ssam_Bar-185100-41102

Most diners choose the marble counter seating, but there are also a handful of tables. An array of small bites makes up Donostia's menu. Find Spanish cheeses and charcuteria of Iberico pork, but the true star here are the conservas. To refer to these as canned seafood would be technically correct but improper- digging into a few is obligatory. Among the temptations, expect a delicate miniature tartalata filled with smooth sea urchin and toothsome octopus. Also try meaty chunks of oil-cured bonito with spicy salsa roja, potato chips, and mini loaf-shaped crackers called picos.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10009-Donostia-468062-41102

Beautifully seared squid and Japanese eggplant grilled until silky are adorned with summer beans, cherry tomatoes, and mint.

The room glows with good vibes that radiate across the hardwood floor, marble bar, and tin ceiling. Contemporary highlights accent the Northern Italian-focused menu of fritto di mare neatly piling hot and delicately crisp calamari, red mullet, jumbo shrimp and a zucchini blossom.

Springtime lunches with garage doors open to the sidewalk, and a feast of refined, simple dishes have earned Jonathan Waxman a devoted following in a neighborhood already full of charming restaurants. Casually professional service and the dimly lit dining room's dose of California cool enhance the experience. Barbuto's roast chicken deserves its legendary status, but other dishes tempt too.

The signature gnocco (sweet, salty pillows of fried bread) can be ordered as an appetizer, side, or even as a dessert with Nutella. Pizzas shine on this carb-centric menu, thanks to that blistered thin crust hanging over the plate's edge. The Amatriciana layers tart tomato sauce with sweet red onion, shreds of pancetta, and a heavy-handed sprinkle of red pepper flakes.

The prix-fixe is a true deal in this neighborhood, especially with choices from the raw bar and charcuterie. For heartier fare, try the country pâté or rabbit terrine, both classically prepared and perfectly seasoned.

Pasta plays front and center here and is luckily always handmade. Gorgeous, rose-shaped tortellini are stuffed with mounds of prosciutto and spinach, before being finished by a perfect plum tomato sauce.

The meze; grilled meat-stuffed sandwiches; and Lebanese-style pizzas called manakeesh topped with the likes of lean ground beef, chopped onion, and spices are all fresh-tasting indeed.

Either way, you'll be well looked after by an attentive team. The menu is also divided-between sushi and sashimi from the bar, and hot dishes from the kitchen. There is an impressive selection of the former, with the sashimi being particularly worthy. The hot dishes range from the traditional to the more innovative and adapted. Avoid the over-generously battered tempura and go instead for the soba noodles, made in house and served with a choice of topping such as uni or ikura, or the rich squid ink risotto with spear squid.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-15_East-185931-41102

The long dining room is colorful, with a cactus garden, vibrant Latin music, and a semi-open kitchen for a peek inside the buzz, especially during happy hour when small plates are flying to the bar. Like the vibe, the cooking favors bold tastes over subtlety.Daily soups showcase careful execution-the chicken and rice may look simple but is spiked with lime and topped with cilantro and grated queso fresco for superb comfort. Alambres de filet mignon pleases with lime-marinated and buttery skewered meat, served alongside beer-battered onion rings and bright lemon-basil chimichurri.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10011-Crema-165330-41102
287,Ootoya,Cuisine Japanese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This Japanese chain boasts more than 300 locations throughout Asia, and now claims three more here in the Big Apple. Thankfully the chic interior does nothing to convey chain dining. Instead, the look is understated with wood slats, ikebana, and muted tones. Ootoya's budget-friendly pricing ensures a full house. Hearty, home-style fare is the hallmark of their expansive menu of (mostly) cooked specialties. House-made tofu, rice bowls, fried free-range chicken with sweet-and-sour sauce, and pork katsu are but just a few of the product-focused items on offer. The lunch sets are an excellent value, built around fine quality fish such as saikyo miso-marinated grilled salmon with chawan mushi, steamed brown rice, and grains, accompanied by a heartwarming miso soup.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10011-Ootoya-399619-41102

A hit since opening, the room is an absolute scene. The pretty people are almost as pretty as the room. Service never impresses, but that is of little importance to this gregarious gaggle of devotees. Tables are accented with flowers and soy-based candles, which cast a glow on each plate. Expect the fresh flavors of ruby-red line-caught tuna sashimi marinated in ginger-soy sauce, sparked by fresh mint and red chili. Bowtie pasta with kasha and veal meatballs slicked with reduced, herb-infused jus is a hearty treat. Desserts may elicit cheers, especially the creamsicle tart-an orange-infused rendition of gâteau Basque.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10014-ABC_Kitchen-280102-41102

Creamy anchovy dressing and meaty bacon join in the chef's take on this classic reinterpretation of a wedge salad. Risotto-style beluga lentils balance intense mushroom stock with a subtle hit of jalapeños. Many dishes highlight delicious restraint, like the pan-roasted branzino with foamy and mild foie-gras veloute.

Simple standard.","Located just below street level on frenetic Atlantic Avenue, a nondescript façade holds a quiet den of serious Neapolitan pizza magic. Enter and you'll find a simple, narrow, wood-paneled room with whitewashed brick walls; a little bar showcasing a handful of wines; an enormous, two-ton clay oven (imported directly from Naples); and a little patio out back for alfresco dining. The mood is decidedly relaxed, and while there are delicious salads, antipasti, and desserts to be tried at Sottocasa, the name of the game here is undoubtedly their wickedly good pizza, served folded, blanche or rosse (with-hurrah!-a gluten-free option as well). Regulars adore the Diavola pie, which comes laced with excellent mozzarella, fresh basil, black olives, and hot sopressata.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11201-Sottocasa-399668-41102

At night, young couples and families routinely pack the room that brandishes a dim and earthy mien. Sample an array of cold and hot appetizers like yellowtail tartare with yuzu-ginger vinaigrette or rock shrimp tempura with creamy-spicy sauce.

293,Bocca,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This trattoria hits all the right notes-and throws in a few novel riffs-to make it as a neighborhood favorite. The Roman cuisine has few faults, and the comfortable setting feels genuine with its parchment-lacquered walls, displayed wine storage, and framed posters of Federico Fellini's classics. Bocca is owned by the team behind Cacio e Pepe in the East Village, so you can expect delicious and dramatically presented tonnarelli cacio e pepe. However, the talented kitchen offers temptations aplenty, such as a bowl of fresh, rich-tasting spaghetti alla chitarra brilliantly dressed with cherry tomato sauce and 'nduja.

Step in to find a smattering of tables, copper-topped dining counter, and shelves lined with canned products, jars, and bottles. Old-world inspiration combines with new-world sensibility and results in product-driven, mostly Italian creations like tagliatelle with Brussels sprouts, tomato butter, and house-made burrata.

Our best addresses.,"It's been many years since super-celebrity chef and TV personality Tom Colicchio opened Craft to great acclaim. Its popularity hasn't waned and the room is filled nightly with casually affluent New Yorkers. Good looks and a committed service team are the top assets and the décor is timeless yet cozy, aerial yet intimate. Bare bulbs emit a glow over wood tables and that smug, handsome bar should be drawing more diners. The menu's forte lies in its meandering conceit, allowing guests to ""craft"" their own meal. Prices are aggressive and these pristine ingredients often plead for a bit more salt or a bit less cooking, but pastas and desserts are where this kitchen shines. A fall tagliatelle with a bath of white truffles is a stunning example of what's possible.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Craft-68332-41102

Whether you perch at the mahogany bar or in the spacious backyard, be sure to come hungry for the splurge-worthy cheese plate and profiteroles-golden, puffy and encapsulating a fennel pollen-flavored ice cream. For a dish to share, try the Le Grand Socca, not normally found outside Liguria (where's it's called farinata) or the South of France.

Then, a whole fish salt-baked in a hefty cask is cracked open, teasing diners with plumes of thyme- and lemon-scented steam. At lunch, the clambake is a briny, heavenly mash-up of lobster, mussels, Dickson's sausage, corn on the cob and fingerling potatoes, served family-style in a rich shellfish broth.

Bombas de la Barceloneta are crunchy, beef-stuffed potato croquettes plated with salsa verde and silken, garlicky aïoli.

Very good standard. Our best addresses.","In a roll-call of New York's most beloved restaurants of the last couple of decades, Gramercy Tavern would be high on many people's list. It is one of those places that manage the rare trick of being so confident in its abilities that it can be all things to all people. You'll probably leave happy whether you've come on a date or are here to impress the in-laws; whether you're closing a deal or simply lubricating the thought processes behind a deal. The ""Tavern"" side is the better one for lunch, especially if there are only two of you and you can sit at the bar-it doesn't take bookings so get here early and join in the grown-up ""I'm not really queuing, I'm just standing here"" queue outside. The ""Dining Room"" is for those who like a little more pomp with their pappardelle, and really comes into its own in the evening. The cooking is the perfect match for the warm and woody surroundings: this is American food sure of its footing and unthreatening in its vocabulary. The main component, be it sea bass or pork loin, is allowed to shine and there is a refreshing lack of over-elaboration on the plate that demonstrates the confidence of the kitchen.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Gramercy_Tavern-69890-41102

Simple standard.","If you're lucky enough to score one of the precious few seats here, make it your mission to arrive on time. The tasting menu's procession begins promptly, so stragglers run the risk of missing out on its first luscious bites-and to deprive yourself of a crunchy fennel pollen-dusted potato croquette would be nothing short of a culinary crime. Since this is strictly a two-woman operation, the military-like precision is easily forgiven. Chef Elise Kornack single-handedly runs the immaculate kitchen while her wife, Anna Hieronimus, congenially attends to the tranquil, intimate dining room. But, the team works in tandem when it comes to presenting the uniquely composed plates. Substitutes are not offered, but there's little chance you won't be happy with what's to come. Black garlic-glazed lamb's tongue anticucho is a stimulating opening act for a refreshing summertime composition of slivered snap peas, intensely flavorful tomato pulp, wild ginger, and a creamy drizzle of chocolate mint purée. The chef's style is a fresh and light approach to quality product as seen in asparagus dressed with oysters whipped into a froth or roasted local pork plated with diced celtuce and wild strawberries.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11231-Take_Root-435836-41102

But never mind because, as the name suggests, there's a big bar here, and a menu that has something for everyone. There is quite a pronounced Asian flavor in many of the dishes, such as the big bowl of PEI mussels with Kaffir lime, chili paste, and Sichuan pepper. Those, however, who prefer their culinary influences a little more homegrown, will find much comfort in the ""double stack"" burger. Anyone mindful of the heart-its health, not its emotional state-will be reassured by the presence of ingredients like kale on the menu.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-Craftbar-68331-41102

The dining room is crowded with tables, so go for the cozy corner banquettes overlooking the action. The rustic, satiating fare is ideal for sharing. Thick pieces of octopus are grilled to a buttery softness and served over marinated chickpeas with olives, oregano, and a slick of labneh.

Despite the revelry, the ambience at Mari Vanna persuades its occupants to sit back and enjoy themselves in the shabby-chic room, done in a bleached palette complemented by embroidered seat backs and glowing chandeliers. Traditional Russian specialties abound with an Olivier salad, salo (house-smoked fatback), borscht, and plump pelmeni served with herbed butter and sour cream.

Good standard. Our best addresses.","At 7:00 P.M. this storefront attached to a gourmet grocer turns into something conceptual and remarkable. Here, Chef César Ramirez-the bespectacled authoritarian-stands center stage, surrounded by sous chefs and state-of-the-art everything. He personally welcomes every guest to his ""table"" which is actually a gleaming steel counter surrounding his kitchen, where each copper pot is watched-over and every porcelain vessel is cooled or warmed to match the temperature of the food it holds. The bar for painstaking detail seems to rise with each dish. Expect a bang of flavor to open your meal, perhaps with a tart layering briny sea trout roe. Signatures like sea urchin piled over toasted brioche with a round of Périgord truffle never lose their impact. However, what was once an endless parade of seafood bites from faraway shores has grown and refined into equally lush mini-entrées. A square of Miyagi beef is whoa-inducing. Tiny wild strawberries, yogurt ice cream, and sake gelée balance each element with wondrous intensity. The menu changes every night, but Chef Ramirez never veers from his brilliant melding of French and Japanese cuisines with modern style that keeps pleasure at the forefront.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11201-Chef_s_Table_at_Brooklyn_Fare-283703-41102

His new residence, housed in the former Veritas space has been tweaked to feature a gallery-style bar that showcases the works of emerging artists, plus a dining room of silver-striped banquettes and walls hung with foxed mirrors. Global accents influence much of the cooking, as in duck breast paired with crispy vegetable spring rolls and sauced with smoky jus. The pine nut-studded seafood sausage is a classic, plated with sauerkraut and grainy mustard beurre blanc, and a sundae of cherry pit-infused ice cream-complete with cherry sorbet and almond cake-is a shining example of seasonality.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10003-elan-443149-41102

The petite space can get packed with a dressy, European crowd. First-rate cooking may begin with fresh and crisp horiatiki salata sporting creamy feta and powerfully fragrant dried oregano; or the small but pleasingly robust sikotakia me fakes, chicken livers sautéed with rosemary laid over a bed of lentils. The reliably decadent moussaka layers crisped potato slices, ground lamb, roasted eggplant, and béchamel so creamy that it verges on fluffy.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10011-Periyali-68342-41102

Eclectic and vegetarian-friendly, the menu also reveals poutine (owner Noah Bernamoff is a Montreal native), roasted eggplant brik dotted with briny capers, pine nuts, and sweet raisins; as well as fresh-baked desserts like almond cake with house-made vanilla ice cream.

Cold options include kabiss, an assortment of spicy pickled vegetables; and moutabbal Almayass, a magenta-colored spread of mashed beets seasoned with sesame paste, lemon, and garlic.

This layout almost recalls namesake Chef Colicchio's stint behind the stoves at Gramercy Tavern.Those neat stacks of chopped wood resting on polished shelves out front are analogous to the menu's ambition: relaxed, rustic yet very contemporary. Warm Parker House rolls are an auspicious prelude to ivory-pink hamachi set over beets with smoked crème fraîche. Fusilli with wild boar ragù and pecorino is nothing short of excellent.

In surroundings of such grandeur, it's easy to assume the food will play second fiddle but that would be a mistake because the Italian food here is very good indeed. The menu layout and pricing can be a little bewildering at first but what becomes abundantly clear is that this is a well-orchestrated kitchen and one which demonstrates considerable skill and plenty of genuine care. Fish fin crudo is a great way to start; pasta dishes are surprisingly robust and generously proportioned; and entrées such as lamb with figs come with an awareness of contemporary tastes. Although pastry chef extraordinaire Brooks Headley has left, his signature desserts remain an immortal highlight on Del Posto's menu.

Excellent standard.","Chef Daniel Humm's cooking is clever, innovative and at times even a little whimsical; it is robust when it needs to be but also delicate at times and it is this variety and depth that really sets it apart. No menu is presented; instead, you're merely asked to relay your list of allergies as though talking to your pharmacist and your work is done. The 15 or so courses that subsequently appear could be playful, like the carrot tartare made at the table, or display extraordinary understanding of technique, such as the dry-aged veal with bone marrow. The restaurant is housed within the sort of grandeur that could only ever have belonged to a financial institution. It's a hard space to fill-conversations don't so much hang in the air as float up to the vast ceiling and never return. But somehow the room's sheer scale and the well-spaced tables allow you to feel cocooned in your own world. Considerable help comes courtesy of the engaging staff as they explain each dish in loving terms but without ever sounding too virtuous.

Murg lababdar tastes of pure elegance in seared and braised de-boned chicken drenched in a sweetly spiced, deeply flavored tomato-onion gravy.

The monochromatic white interior has taken a beating over the years, but that's easy to look past when the eats are as cheap and tasty as these.

Begin with thrillingly fatty, thick-cut bacon nearly sweet on the outside, or shrimp cocktail in a rich tomato dressing. But, what truly leaves diners speechless is that delightfully succulent Porterhouse for two, three, or four. These slabs of beautifully naked meat are simple but their marbling is a thing of complexity and perfection, sizzling in drippings. The wedge salad sets a new standard: it is an enormous and crisp slice of iceberg drowned in blue cheese dressing, chopped tomato, and more bacon. The carnivorous feast is complete when sanctified by crispy French fries or excellent creamed spinach. Properly prepped servers are cordial, yet informal and never chatty. A hunk of NY cheesecake, creamy, tart, and served with schlag, is every bit as classic as one imagines.

A tart green mango salad mingled with crispy anchovies and sweet cashew nuts is a delight on its own; while banana blossom fritters should be dunked in thick peanut-chili sauce for more flavor.

Wherever you sit, you'll find the service confident and engaging and the menu hugely appealing. Don't come expecting the culinary pyrotechnics of Eleven Madison Park: here it's about familiar flavors in more approachable, less intricate dishes, but with the same care and understanding of ingredients. Chicken-which, if we're honest, would be the final meal of choice of many of us-is the undoubted star; they roast a whole bird, pimp it up with foie gras and black truffle and serve it for two. Bone marrow adds depth to beef, while asparagus with bread sauce shows the kitchen is equally adept when subtlety is required.

Attached to the markedly hip Ace Hotel, this uber-stylish gastropub, known for its pretty patrons and perpetual buzz, is a place to see and be seen. Booths tucked into nooks on one side of the room are by far the best seats in the house, but all is not lost if you can't nab one. Close-knit tables adorned with white china and rustic wooden boards are equally inviting, with views of the open kitchen. If your welcome was a bit...well lukewarm...you'll find that the tee- and tattoo-donning staff warms up as service progresses-not unlike one's appreciation for the chef's outstanding creations. Parmesan and fried parsley leaves gild the romaine in a delicious, very garlicky Caesar salad; just as a coiled link of terrifically flavored merguez is perfectly finished with smoky Marcona almond aïoli. Meanwhile, warm and milky burrata gains great flavor and texture when kissed by nutty hazelnut pesto. Clementine cake frosted with mascarpone and dates is a sweet example of how this kitchen elevates seemingly simple eats to thoroughly stellar treats.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10001-The_Breslin-270921-41102

Our best addresses.,"Brought to you by Chef April Bloomfield and company, this oyster bar occupies a blue-chip, corner spot in the untouchably cool Ace Hotel. The style is vintage with aquatic accents: floor-to-ceiling windows flood the space with light, while black-tiled columns, copper tables, and crayon-bright green and blue bar stools complete the look. The unpretentious and modern menu showcases impeccable seafood. An assortment from the raw bar may feature whelks with parsley and garlic butter; east- and west-coast oysters shucked before your very eyes; and top quality shellfish with a lemon-and-shallot sauce. On the menu, find semolina soup with Nantucket bay scallops, or Spanish mackerel with crunchy cilantro-squid crackers. Sadly, service can be indifferent.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10001-The_John_Dory_Oyster_Bar-331684-41102

Pay attention, or you'll miss the entry-the wood-armored façade is a sly indication of its existence. Step inside and receive warm greetings all around, followed by an escorted journey to your private dining booth on one of the floors above. Each booth is sequestered by cooling bamboo shades, while dark wood and minimal lighting further elevate the sense of intimacy. When you need assistance, ring the tabletop buzzer. Zenkichi's omakase is a big draw, but items may also be ordered à la carte. These may highlight house-made tofu drizzled with chilled dashi; maguro carpaccio arranged over shredded carrots and dressed with a ginger sauce; or grilled jidori chicken with yuzu kosho.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11211-Zenkichi-232409-41102

Outfitted in reclaimed pine, vintage lights, and concrete floors, it has an industrial look but is awash with sunlight thanks to soaring windows. The eclectic menu roams across Asia with deliciously balanced and infinitely varied plates. Subtlety reigns in an avocado-tofu summer roll paired with peanut curry sauce or salt-and-pepper shrimp, while Chinese water spinach with fermented tofu cream delivers an intense punch of flavor. Fried rice with salmon and peas is less than classic but more than popular. Rich tastes and silky textures meld beautifully in coconut crème caramel.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10001-Chop_Shop-369521-41102
386,Resto,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Vibrant cooking, a winning ambience, and an inviting marble bar have made this brasserie a perpetual neighborhood favorite. Despite numerous kitchen shakeups, the talented team behind the line always lands on its feet and continues to turn out a roster of worthwhile temptations. Moules frites are a hold-over from when Belgian cooking dominated the menu, but contemporary plates have included charred squid salad with citrus segments and shaved sunchokes; cavatelli with creamy fontina cheese, shaved Brussels sprouts, and toasted pine nuts; and pork shoulder steak with fava bean gribiche. For an array of meaty treats washed down by global brews, head next door to sister spot The Cannibal, which has a second, thriving outpost in midtown's Gotham Market West.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10016-Resto-208810-41102
387,Lupulo,Cuisine Portuguese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Located at the base of Eventi, a Kimpton Hotel, Chef George Mendes' elegant restaurant is a beautiful, industrial-chic ode to the casual home cooking of Portugal. Food voyeurs should vie for a seat at the bar, where they can eye fresh seafood lined up in plump, shimmering rows or enjoy the action behind the glass wall of the semi-open kitchen. Otherwise, a seat in the bustling dining room, decked out in gorgeous Portuguese tiles and hip lobster-trap lights, ought to do the trick.Try the espargos assados, a dish of tender, spit-grilled spring asparagus topped with shaved dried sea urchin, sorrel, olive oil and a dust of sea salt; or the wickedly good frango piri-piri, grilled to perfection and served with its mouthwatering namesake pepper sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10001-Lupulo-472162-41102

With a rustic aesthetic and modern touches, it's a lovely spot to cozy up with a craft beer at the bar, where the bartender is on a first-name basis with regulars. The menu prizes top ingredients that skew local, as in the tender L.I. fluke with succulent mussels marinière, made even heftier with a creamy, garlic-buttery broth of white wine, parsley, and shallots. Don't even try to share that dish; instead, greedily sop it all up with an order of hot and gently crisped ""tongue bread."" Finish with pistachio frangipane tart, blending sweet and nutty flavors in a dense crust and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11205-The_Runner-441669-41102
389,Colonia Verde,Cuisine Latin American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"The historic blocks with row homes on Fort Greene's DeKalb Ave. make for an equally appealing restaurant row. Thanks to a sunken front room that flanks the open kitchen's wood-fired oven, plus a glassed-in ""greenhouse"" that transitions to a pebbled outdoor garden, locals stroll into Colonia Verde no matter the time of year. And why not? The banter is lively and meals rewarding. Its menu is a Brazilian-esque expression of the owners of Cómodo in SoHo. Curiously named dishes like poblano pepper fettuccine stars pasta tossed with a spicy, satisfying ragù made from roasted poblanos, pecans, and ground beef. For dessert, the Brooklyn Mess sweetens the deal: three scoops of coffee ice cream topped with mango, dulce de leche syrup, and toasted manioc flour.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11205-Colonia_Verde-443000-41102

Frankies 457 Spuntino, a charming, brick-lined space with bare wood tables and a quiet, shady backyard strung with twinkling bistro lights, is a classic example of their easy Brooklyn style. Seem familiar by now? Well, these guys wrote the book. Service is laid-back and unpretentious, perhaps because they know the food does the talking here: a wildly fresh fennel, celery root, and parsley salad arrives with aged pecorino and a delicate lemon vinaigrette; while a tender tangle of linguini is laced with a fresh tomato broth studded with fava beans and garlic.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11231-Frankies_457_Spuntino-122850-41102

Simple standard.","Despite the fact that this sounds like Grandpa's pet-name for his antique tractor, The General Greene is a space that nicely straddles rusticity and hipness while serving three satisfying meals a day. Everything seems cool here, if perhaps a bit aloof, from the perfectly ambient lighting, comfy banquettes, and leather bar stools to that highly prized espresso machine and free WiFi for your iPad. The menu has a playful Southern slant, as seen in a warm haricot vert salad tossed with dates, almonds, and orange segments with a chive-buttermilk biscuit; or mac and cheese melting Vermont cheddar, Gruyère, and parmesan folded with cavatelli. Ham-and-Gruyère bread pudding is custard-like and brutally addictive. Homemade cookies seem to fly out the door.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11205-The_General_Greene-253732-41102

Attractively rustic, the compact dining room is lined by slats of unpolished wood, and provides seating along a colorful fabric-covered banquette. The bar-like the back patio-is an inviting roost. Tabaré's cooking uses local product and represents the Italian-Spanish influences that color the kitchen's creations.

The booths in front are bright and snug, while bentwood chairs and net curtains tied into a knot add to that brasserie feel. A warm vibe and cheery servers complete the picture. Hand-crafted sausages and burgers are all the rage here. Nibble away on homemade pretzels while perusing the lunch menu, which may be simple and sandwich-focused, but always showcases a gutsy edge. Bold flavors shine through in a creamy roasted squash soup; jagerwurst, a lightly charred, delicately smoky, and meaty sausage with red cabbage casserole; or Jen's German potato salad tossing waxy potato slices, chopped herbs, and thick bacon lardons in a pickled dressing.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11231-Prime_Meats-259136-41102

The results are distinct and delicious. Among the host of options to be tried are shoyu (soy-based), shio (salt-based), or the special house ramen brimming with a bounty of shellfish. A recent unique offering featured a fiery broth infused with a blend of 12 spices and fish sauce and filled with bone-in pork rib, cabbage, and red chilies.

395,Delaware and Hudson,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Good standard.","This small Williamsburg gem arrives courtesy of Chef/owner Patti Jackson, who marries her Northeastern Pennsylvania upbringing (sourcing her ingredients from the wonderful farms that dot the Mid-Atlantic) with her lengthy culinary resume (I Trulli, for starters). The results are, as you'd expect, delightful. In summer months, there's a small outdoor patio with a handful of seats overlooking the sidewalk. Inside the restaurant, you'll find a long, narrow dining space with exposed wood beams; bare wooden tables; and photographs on the walls depicting farm life. The overall effect is one of rustic, folksy ease-with a genuinely warm and knowledgeable service staff adding to the appeal. Diners are offered a rotating, four-course dinner at an excellent value, where a collection of seasonal, farm-fresh small plates kick off the meal, followed by a pasta course, choice of entrée, and, finally, the day's dessert. Each dish is more delicious than the last: a mouthwatering plate of hand-rolled macaroni alla pettine arrives with tender grilled zucchini, salty farmer's cheese, and mint; while a flaky fillet of Long Island fluke is paired with smooth polenta, ripe Sun Gold tomatoes, and a cascade of chopped eggplant.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11249-Delaware_and_Hudson-442171-41102

Simple standard.","Small plates smacked with flavor are the dishes du jour at this rollicking eatery. The moniker translates to ""forbidden"" in Yiddish, and the renegade menu displays an affinity for pork and shellfish. From the open kitchen, Chef Jason Marcus and his team send a steady stream of solid creations like cornmeal-dusted fried green tomatoes with Old Bay aïoli and Tabasco sauce. Head-on prawns, pan-roasted in foie gras fat with wild mushrooms and spring onion, are served on a slice of toast thick enough to absorb all the savory drippings. For dessert, try the butterscotch budino layered with rosemary ice cream and chopped hazelnuts. The narrow space is muted with pale grey walls but enhanced by a mural of cartoon colors and an especially pleasant back patio.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11211-Traif-335742-41102

With a reputation for cocktails, a classic wood bar, and tables covered in colorful oilcloths depicting flora and fauna, this is a lively but not-too-crowded watering hole with solid cooking and heaps of character. A meal could start with crostini topped with local ricotta, shiitake mushrooms, kale, and parmesan. On a blustery day in windswept Red Hook, perhaps the smoky lentil soup will do. Locals return time and again for classics like faultless deviled eggs dusted with paprika. A lean towards the South is seen in the hearty muffuletta of New Orleans fame.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11231-Fort_Defiance-324039-41102

Egg's ravenous following is now accommodated in a much larger location that's light and bright with seating at a number of counters and ample table space; yet it's still common to be faced with a queue. Breakfast is served all day, every day, and stars those fantastic buttermilk biscuits. The fresh-baked beauties are split open and smothered with pork sausage-studded sawmill gravy, stacked with country ham, house-made fig jam, and Vermont cheddar cheese; or simply accompanied by molasses, honey, or jelly.

Locals return for the two daily cocktails (one bitter, one sour) along with the short, none-too-complicated menu that is a study in the strength of focus. This is the type of inviting neighborhood joint that calls for a glass of wine and soulful pasta at the bar. Dishes are straightforward but satisfy in their careful execution. A squid salad with cannellini beans, tomato, herbs, and fantastic olive oil is elevated by seasoning and texture from toasted breadcrumbs. Tortelli stuffed with fluffy ricotta find a succulent home in pork ragù.

Quality trumps quantity in the streamlined selection of product-driven creations. Silken strands of house-made fettucine twirled with lemon beurre blanc and finely grated parmesan make an enticing starter, while pan-seared skate garnished tableside with coconut milk broth redolent of lemongrass and Persian lime is an inspired entrée.

A delicious alchemy is at work here, as evidenced in the crabmeat-topped tamale flan sauced with fava bean-poblano purée; baked lamb meatballs in chipotle cream accompanied by grilled garlic and cheese sprinkled Texas toast; or strawberry tres leches with fragrant cilantro ice cream. Like the menu, the beverage listing is loads of fun.

Whether you're having the squab with salsify or the ""rabbit and the carrot,"" you'll know you're in the hands of a kitchen with a mastery of modern cooking techniques. His dishes are all artfully presented creations and the combinations of superlative ingredients and well-defined flavors display far greater depth than the somewhat terse three-word menu descriptions would suggest. The dining room, within the Hotel Chandler, is a touch anodyne and tables are ridiculously far apart, but the atmosphere remains far from solemn thanks, in no small part, to the personality and genuine care shown by the well-informed and helpful service team.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10016-Juni-435822-41102

Feast your eyes on the open kitchen, where the talented team crafts obsession-worthy dishes like the double-decker broccoli tacos. The exemplary combination of flavors and textures is simply brilliant: both a soft and a crisp taco shell (with just the right grease-tinged crunch) hold a mixture of cooked broccoli, salty feta, creamy beans, and fried shallots.

For even more reasons to imbibe, climb down to the basement offshoot, The Bar Below Rye.

Co-owner Ben Schneider crafted the space, while his classically trained wife, Chef Sohui Kim, helms the kitchen. Her cuisine reflects the team's commitment to the locality, as seen in such original dishes as pan-seared cod reclining on squid rings braised in a spicy kimchi broth; or hot and crisp manchego arancini cooled with yogurt and a fennel-tomato marmalade.

The briefest of descriptions is offered upon presentation, which means that a mouthful of ""grilled squash,"" for example, might also deliver raw slivers of pattypan, creamy peanut sauce, and a dusting of dried mint. Embellishments like foie gras and trout roe are used sparingly and to splendid effect, never outshining the true flavor of the produce. Semilla's bread is house-made, excellent, and used to accentuate the menu; as seen in a wedge of flax seed-barley sourdough with cultured butter to accompany a roasted carrot ""mille-feuille,"" alongside smoked potato purée and fava-greens sauce.

From refreshing pieces of cold-poached chicken tossed with a generous mound of chili-oil and peanuts, to aromatic smoked tofu mingled with silky batons of celery stalk, flavors here often bring more complexity than straight heat and the presentations are more genteel than brute. But that's not to say the kitchen doesn't conduct a fiery arrangement-try crisp, meaty, and double cooked pork belly harmonized with hot Sichuan peppercorns, green bell peppers, leeks, and fermented black beans.

Tables are lined with pages from old cookbooks and the walls have vintage mirrors and shelves stocked with an impressive selection of cookbooks. This Latin-influenced neighborhood spot also has a seasonal back patio for alfresco dining. Daily brunch makes the most of the bright, sunny eggs that enhance many dishes, especially the lush yolks that ooze into the herbaceous pumpkin seed mole over potato hash with thinly sliced chunks of tender lengua. A deliciously chewy grain salad popping with quinoa, barley, and tender beluga lentils in a tart, lemony vinaigrette is a healthy, tasty pick-and an easy favorite.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11215-Juventino-270952-41102
479,Gabriel Kreuther,Cuisine Contemporary,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Very good standard. Our best addresses.","The Grace Building's swooping white travertine façade is a bulwark for the spacious and serene treasure within, a familiar name that has once again brightened Manhattan's dining scene. Don't let the oasis of nearby Bryant Park distract you from this new destination, where cream leather seating, reclaimed timber columns, and a glass-walled display kitchen combine for a uniquely pulled together enclave boasting a luxe lounge area. Chef Gabriel Kreuther's Alsatian heritage provides a distinctive mark here, evinced by the stork imagery throughout and by his exciting cuisine espousing regional pride. His elegantly composed sturgeon and sauerkraut tart is a delightful signature creation adorned with American caviar and infused with smoke. Frilly cones of nori-enriched pasta are presented with meaty slices of Alaskan king crab and parsnip purée; while lusciously tender Maine lobster poached in Mangalitsa lardo is dressed with jamón emulsion. Kreuther has brought back the palate cleanser, updated and perfectly executed, to prepare you for the finale which may be titled ""Contemporary"" and reveal pistachio genoise and vanilla cream encased in dark cherry gelée topped with lime-vanilla sorbet.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-Gabriel_Kreuther-474823-41102
480,The Saint Austere,Cuisine Contemporary,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,,"Sometimes all one needs is a fine glass of wine and a little snack (or three). For this, The Saint Austere fits the bill nicely. Platings bring on far-flung influences-as in the bánh Mi(lano), pork terrine, thinly shaved mortadella, and house-pickled vegetables sandwiched into a toasted baguette moistened by a chili-flecked dressing. However, the menu's truest muse is a general coupling of Italian and Spanish flavors, such as pork belly croquetas accompanied by a dipping sauce of crushed chicken livers; or slow-cooked polenta topped with sweet onions caramelized in sausage drippings. The spartanly adorned room offers a hospitable bar in addition to three communal tables. And the wine list proffers a gently priced selection of mostly European labels.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11211-The_Saint_Austere-360808-41102
481,Greenpoint Fish & Lobster Co.,Cuisine Seafood,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Fronted by green awnings, and flooded with light, this corner gem is equal parts sustainably sourced fish market and fantastic eat-in spot. Walk past iced specimens to claim a seat at the white marble counter; then dig into the day's catch dressed-up with global influences. New England clam chowder is given the classic treatment, while grilled sea bass skewers are accompanied by a Thai coconut-and-peanut dipping sauce. Local fluke touched by extra virgin olive oil, a squeeze of Meyer lemon, and Maldon sea salt is an example of the first-rate crudo of the day; while Baja-style fish tacos feature tortillas stuffed with fried pollack, shredded cabbage, and chipotle-lime mayonnaise. For the fish-free, a raw vegan kelp noodle-pad Thai is remarkably satisfying.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11222-Greenpoint_Fish_Lobster_Co-468340-41102
482,Al Seabu,Cuisine Malaysian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"The already impressive Park Slope dining scene gets another notch in its belt with Al Seabu, a little family-run restaurant with a seafood-centric menu and big personality. Decorated in cheerful sea-blue walls and industrial shelves lined with charming seashells, Al Seabu also boasts a friendly staff and fun, contemporary music. The overall effect is one of relaxed charm-and that's before the food knocks your socks off. Don't miss the grilled pulut panggang, little cigars of sticky rice dabbed with coconut and shrimp paste; or fork-tender nyonya beef rendang served with a pile of fluffy white rice and cool slices of cucumber and tomato to cut the heat. Fried mantou, hot sweet buns served with creamy condensed milk for dipping, makes for a dreamy finish.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11215-Al_Seabu-472180-41102
483,Osteria Laguna,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"A little bit corporate (it is midtown, after all) and a little bit casual (daytrippers from nearby Grand Central), Osteria Laguna has nailed its audience and delivers a perfect blend to suit both worlds. Inside, it's delightfully rustic, complete with the requisite Italian ceramic plates and wooden chairs with rush seating. Crowd-pleasers like pastas, pizzas from the wood-burning oven, antipasti, salads, and nicely done fish, starch, and vegetables comprise the menu at this better-than-average gem. The friendly service can be spotty, but the perfectly crisped wood-fired pizzas are always spot on. The portions are abundant, perhaps even too much given the tiny tables, but the prices aren't, so you can treat your out-of-town friend and keep the change.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10017-Osteria_Laguna-69678-41102
484,Sushi Yasuda,Cuisine Japanese,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"A MICHELIN star: cuisine of great finesse. Worth the step! 





Good standard.","Efficiency trumps hospitality at this sushi temple, where warm honey-toned bamboo slats are by far the warmest feature. Reservations are managed with little coddling, arrivals lack any greeting, tardiness is not accepted, and loitering at the counter is not an option. But to sushi-loving diehards, this is just the cost of admission. Tables packed with suits (this is midtown, after all) should be avoided in favor of the sleek counter attended to by a pristinely attired staff as this is where the magic happens. And, your experience here depends entirely on the itamae enlisted in front of you. Their mission is to ensure that each diner receives fish that has just been cut, formed, and dressed moments before it is eaten. After years of buildup, this kitchen is finally living up to its hype-with a wealth of classically assembled and spectacularly fresh sushi on offer. Every item is handled with such care and is truly memorable: a sparkling combo of sea scallop and oyster is sprinkled with soy sauce, sea salt, and lemon; a duo of uni lets the palate compare specimens from Santa Barbara and Hokkaido; and a trio of King, Alaskan white, and wild New Zealand salmon nigiri makes for a fantastic treat.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10017-Sushi_Yasuda-69153-41102

Very good standard.","Nestled smack dab in the middle of the melee that constitutes modern-day Times Square, Aureole's message is clear from the moment you enter its serene glass façade: drop your bags (and perhaps your shoulders) and relax-it's time to be pampered by a truly exquisite seafood-centric meal in a luxurious setting. Up front, you'll find the Liberty Room, home to a lively bar that's ideal for an after-work drink or pre-dinner cocktail; and a small collection of handsome, walnut-topped tables comprising a more casual dining area. Toward the back of the restaurant, the formal dining room cuts an impressive, elegant figure with sexy low lighting; crisp white tablecloths; and polished table settings. Dinner might begin with a beautifully composed peekytoe crab salad, sporting vibrant green avocado panna cotta, juicy watermelon and sea beans; and then move on to a gorgeous slice of fresh Alaskan black cod in a sweet and savory marinade, paired with crisp snap peas, bok choy, and choy sum.

Slices of fluke, topped with a whisper of yuzu, maple, basil purée, and a sprinkle of sea salt is a delicate start, while the lamb bun is slathered with feta cream and stuffed with tender meat, fresh dill, and pickled onion. Flavors are just as intense in the entrées, from the sea urchin fusilli with lump crabmeat to the seared duck breast over cous cous with a tart fennel-and-pomegranate salad.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11238-Cooklyn-468337-41102

As young as this American gastropub is, it feels as comfortable and rustic as a well-worn pair of jeans-just right for settling into a fast-paced match on TV. True to its pub spirit, the food keeps pace with the ample beer list with a crackling, tender, and moist crab cake, fried until golden and topped with a deeply spiced remoulade. Deep bowls of turkey chili are rich and hearty, with loads of ground turkey, cumin, and bits of smoky bacon served with fluffy white rice and cornbread.

You'll need to book in advance, but tucked away in the basement of a midtown office building, Sakagura is an amazing little hideaway with a phenomenal sake list (including seasonal selections) and a smattering of delicious small plates for pairing. All this fabulousness may have gone to their head a bit as the service seems a bit lacking these days, but it's worth it for that flash of authentic Tokyo by way of midtown. A couple of gems off the massive menu include the uzaku, grilled eel with cucumbers and seaweed in vinaigrette; perfectly chewy soba noodles presented in a traditional basket with dipping sauce, scallion, and wasabi; and tender tori karaage, a delicious Japanese fried chicken marinated in sake, soy, and ginger.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10017-Sakagura-122820-41102

Tasty appetizers may unveil a salad of assorted pickles and simmered daikon in a sweet ginger dressing. Skip over the fried seafood in favor of the soba totto gozen set, which includes the wonderful soba in fragrant dashi; or try one of the many delicious dons topped with tasty tidbits like sea urchin and salmon roe or soy-marinated tuna, grated yam, and egg.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10017-Soba_Totto-270933-41102

Tall ceilings and pale earthy hues combine for a soothing look that is accentuated by wood flooring, stone, and an artful tangle of bamboo stalks. The counter is bright, comfortable, and puts you in view of Chef Toshio Suzuki in action. Lunchtime brings crowds who come for the excellent value set sushi menu. A salad with ginger-based dressing and delicately crisp tempura of shrimp, seasonal vegetables, and yuba precede excellent quality Edomae-sushi, featuring rice seasoned with the chef's own vinegar.

Here, sunny yellow walls, rustic farmhouse tables topped with fresh flowers, and a staff that's genuinely gracious even while attending to the lunchtime throngs make up a completely charming package. As if in defiance of its bustling locale, this authentic osteria gives much cause to sit and savor. The menu offers a taste of Venice in a range of specialties that include risotto nero, pan-roasted calf's livers in an onion gravy, and grilled prawns over soft polenta with sweet paprika sauce. Daily specials are another enjoyable way to go, as in the velvet-smooth, dairy-free spinach soup buoyed by a fontina crostini; or cavatelli tossed with sausage, sweet peas, and creamy tomato sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-Osteria_al_Doge-69450-41102

Helmed by Chef/restaurateur Geoffrey Zakarian and reimagined by designer Thierry Despont, this handsome retreat is a glamorous art deco backdrop of ebonized walls and red leather seating set aglow by stainless steel torchieres and a fireplace. It's a fitting scene for the novel American food that follows. Try slow-poached halibut with crispy frog's legs and licorice herbs, paired with seasonal sides like roasted carrots with prune purée and pecan granola. End with apple crisp ""tatin"" sandwiching flaky pastry, roasted apples, and caramel mousse.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-The_Lambs_Club-324016-41102

Like its setting, the menu is inventive and unites classic bistro cooking with market-inspired creations. That lush pâté en croute is a buttery pastry encasing layers of creamy country pâté, guinea hen, and foie gras, dressed with huckleberry compote, toasted pine nuts, and pickled enoki mushrooms. Wild rice-crusted fluke presented with Hawaiian blue prawn and sauce Américaine further demonstrate the kitchen's contemporary leanings.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-db_Bistro_Moderne-69453-41102

At least this sleek, moodily-lit Chinese restaurant comes with an 80-foot corridor behind its front door, allowing you time to adjust from tourist town to sexy sanctum. Cobalt-blue glass, marble and mirrors help create a striking space that feels surprisingly intimate considering its size. Service may need the occasional prompt but the Cantonese food is good and the cocktails terrific. Standouts are stir-fried sugar pea shoots with crabmeat and scallops, and jasmine tea-smoked chicken. And if you're wondering how they charge what they do for sesame prawn toast, order it and you'll see (clue: it's the foie gras).",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-Hakkasan-366498-41102
495,Aburiya Kinnosuke,Cuisine Japanese,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Call it a trip to Tokyo without the tariff. This dark, sophisticated Japanese izakaya is tucked down a side street in bustling midtown. Grab an intimate table for two or join the crowd at the open kitchen counter surrounding the smoky robata grill. The waiters talk up the omakase, but it's worth trusting your own instincts to guide you on a personalized tour through their authentic offerings. The sukiyaki is a must-try seasonal offering of tender marbled beef served in a hot pot bobbing with a beaten egg, tofu, vegetables, and noodles. Other favorites include smoky bamboo shoots fresh off the robata with shaved bonito; and their legendary tsukune, a tender ground chicken meatball brushed with teriyaki and dipped in raw egg.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10017-Aburiya_Kinnosuke-122785-41102

Mom's sweet-and-sour cucumber salad, flavored with ginger and garlic, is a bracing start for Peking duck confit bao spread with hoisin mayonnaise, garnished with crispy duck chicharrònes and duck fat popcorn dusted with Chinese five spice. Another hit: the taco of ""reverse"" carnitas is a pile of succulent pork shoulder that's been seared then braised in a broth of beer, oranges, and tomatoes, and finally topped with crunchy bits of radish and spicy pickles.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11222-Lucky_Luna-443002-41102
497,Sushi Katsuei,Cuisine Japanese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Park Slope's serious sushi den is the kind of place where the itamae will adamantly decline requests for soy sauce. But rest assured it comes from a place of love, because that beautiful piece of nigiri has already been brushed with soy sauce, sprinkled with yuzu and sea salt, or dabbed with yuzu kosho. In other words, it's fantastic as is. A handful of straightforward cooked items like free-range chicken teriyaki or tempura udon are great if the kids are in tow, but the real focus is sushi best enjoyed in an omakase that won't break the bank. Be sure to choose the option that includes sashimi and begin this repast with velvety slices of medium fatty tuna and sparkling sea bass, followed by a maki of mackerel, slivered cucumber and pickled ginger.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11215-Sushi_Katsuei-443007-41102

Leave inhibitions behind when digging into the Nippon nachos, a cross of Japanese and Tex-Mex that tops crisp gyoza with cheddar cheese, pico de gallo, and masago-infused sour cream. ""You've got quail"" and truffle polenta primes you for more cheeky dishes, such as habanero chicken and ""woffals"" (waffles enriched with chicken liver) or a deep-fried foie gras doughnut.

Its classic steakhouse atmosphere-gruff but prompt service, noisy post-work bar scene, and gargantuan portions-is met with commendable dishes that reach beyond the normal chop shop fare. While the beef speaks for itself, the kitchen's execution takes common combos to the next level: mozzarella and tomatoes are drizzled in flavorful balsamic and olive oil with a chiffonade of basil and shallots; while soft-shell crabs arrive perfectly battered and tempura fried. This massive special, with crisp asparagus and bed of sautéed spinach, showcases great culinary technique and seasonality not expected from a midtown lunch hangout.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10169-Bobby_Van_s-68670-41102

Partake in tacos featuring hand-crafted tortillas, like the suadero stuffed with beef brisket and avocado salsa; or torta tinga de pollo, packed with shredded chipotle-braised chicken, mashed black beans, pickled jalapeños, and a toasted roll to sop up that delish sauce. Reposado and diced mango enhances the pastel tres leches-and to keep the tequila flowing, hit up nearby Zona Rosa, Chef Garcia's latest venture.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11052-Mesa_Coyoacan-260071-41102

The steady kitchen turns out consistently impressive cuisine that starts off with a listing of crudo, such as petals of pale pink seabream simply but impeccably dressed with Meyer lemon-infused olive oil, Amagansett sea salt, and black pepper. Other plates reveal seared monkfish liver, custard-soft within, served atop radicchio, organic grains, and candied citrus.

This is a sophisticated and elegant midtown restaurant with an appealing self-confidence. Even the soundtrack appears to have been chosen by someone who actually knows what good music sounds like. Service is snappy, assured, and well-organised. The menu is contemporary without being faddish. Flavor combinations, such as the sesame salmon with soy, are recognizable and complementary and dishes pass that most basic of tests: they are very easy to eat.

503,Patroon,Cuisine American,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Very good standard.,"For those in the know, this elegant canteen needs no introduction. Patroon exudes the air of a private club-one where suited professionals huddle over drinks at the sleek bar; and dining rooms fill with power lunchers who smoke cigars on the rooftop. That this restaurant draws a devoted crowd of regulars should come as no surprise; the maître d' and his gracious servers are top-notch and the kitchen team is highly competent. Come dinnertime, the classic cooking is especially impressive: bracing ceviche may feature Long Island fluke; then Dover sole is plated tableside; and light yet satisfying leek gratin caters to diners who would rather invest the calories elsewhere-say a fine pour from the well-curated wine list or a perfect crème brulée for dessert.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10017-Patroon-472170-41102

Good standard.","Anyone who loves their Indian food but got jaded by the generic ghee-heavy menus of Curry Hill should head along to Tulsi. In place of the seizure-inducing colored lighting, this midtown favorite offers billowing muslin and neutral tones; and instead of the usual Bollywood clichés, it provides tranquil, sophisticated surroundings, and attentive, sweet natured service. The menu is also markedly different from the norm. For the appetizers, the kitchen takes the sort of snacks you can find streetside on Chaupati and, by putting its own spin on them (and using primary ingredients), raises them to new heights-such as with the white beans of ragda chaat, which is a great way to start your meal. You can also go Goan for some Portuguese influence with the succulent shrimp balchao. But, be sure to leave room for authentic goat biryani served on the bone, or something from the tandoor like those tender lamb chops. As a nod to local tastes, spicing can be a little timid but those who are familiar with India-and anyone who knows their silly mid-on from their backward point-will still find much to savor.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10017-Tulsi-331696-41102

The concise menu of fragrant and flavorful cooking keeps people coming back for luscious compositions like nasi campur-chopped long bean lawar dressed in lime juice, galangal, and toasted coconut, served with prawn crackers plus shaved red chili. A Bali fish salad seasoned with turmeric and shallot is yet another favored treat.

Orchid-topped tables look even prettier once the food arrives. The wallet-friendly and over-flowing lunch buffet brings office workers in by droves, while the early evening prix-fixe is popular with the pre-theater crowd. Delights include tandoori chicken kali mirch liberally seasoned with crushed black pepper, as well as Hyderabadi shrimp curry with a bright red tamarind and chili sauce so tasty it begs to be sopped up by hot wedges of aloo paratha.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-Utsav-184979-41102

Then, dive into generously sized lunch specials featuring perhaps a colorful chirashi, headlining yellowtail, salmon, tamago, and amberjack set deftly over well-seasoned sushi rice. Sticky-glazed eel, nicely grilled and plenty fatty, is an absolute must as is the impressive omakase for dinner.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10017-Tsushima-184993-41102
510,44 & X Hell's Kitchen,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"The moniker is a mouthful, but this modern bistro's endearing appeal has attracted eclectic crowds since opening on a block west of no-man's land. Today, this corner of Hell's Kitchen is a solid, mature venue that offers plenty of reason to swing by. Cute servers in black t-shirts are gracious and attentive, presenting updated renditions of spirited comfort food. Lobster tacos with charred tomato salsa, crunchy buttermilk fried chicken accompanied by a chive waffle and maple syrup jus, as well as pan-roasted mahi mahi with lobster and scallop risotto emerge from the skilled kitchen. House-baked apple pie was a lovely sweet special to ward off the chill of an autumn evening. Sister spot 44 ½ boasts a menu of Asian and Mediterranean influences.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-44_X_Hell_s_Kitchen-70037-41102
511,Barbetta,Cuisine Italian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"It doesn't get more old-world New York than this iconic Restaurant Row institution. Opened in 1906, Barbetta is a testament to proper dining out: men are required to don dinner jackets, outerwear is mandatorily checked, and a brigade of starched servers flit about the hushed and gilded surrounds. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the impossibly romantic patio has been the backdrop for countless marriage proposals. The kitchen's Northern-influenced specialties are listed on thick cardstock, and each selection is highlighted by the year of its addition to the menu. Linguine with pesto alla Genovese is as scrumptious today as it was in 1914; while luscious rabbit alla Piemontese, dating back to the Clinton era and braised in white wine and lemon, is equally divine.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-Barbetta-104165-41102
512,Scarlatto,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Dip down below street level to find a lovely exposed brick interior displaying rows of wine bottles and glass beaded wall sconces to match the sparkly tiara crowning Audrey Hepburn in a framed still from Roman Holiday. The menu doesn't offer many surprises but this is cooking that-just like a little black dress-never goes out of style. Among the array, search out polpette al pomodoro, house-made meatballs in a tomato ragù, or bean soup with fresh pasta. Their pollo Parmigiana is a ""red sauce"" classic, made with breaded and fried chicken breast draped in a bright tomato sugo beneath a bounty of grated and caramelized parmesan, served atop a mound of al dente spaghetti. Theater-goers take note: a prix-fixe dinner is offered throughout the evening.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-Scarlatto-231367-41102
513,Becco,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This Restaurant Row stalwart has no shortage of competition, but remains unrivaled when it comes to pleasing diners and theater-goers with reliable and hearty Italian fare. This is all thanks to culinary authority Lidia Bastianich, her impresario son Joe, and longtime Executive Chef William Gallagher. Becco's pleasing vision of Italian cuisine includes house-made mozzarella en carozza sandwiched between fried bread with pesto and tomato sauces; and Belgian-ale roasted pulled pork with salsa verde. The sarma (Croatian for stuffed cabbage) honors the family's Istrian heritage with meat-stuffed cabbage in tomato sauce over pan-fried spinach spaetzle. The wine list features bottles priced at $29, with selections from their own highly regarded label.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-Becco-69441-41102
514,Hatsuhana,Cuisine Japanese,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"It's been around since the beginning of time (in NYC Japanese restaurant years) but this is no lesser a destination for excellent sushi. With a retro décor that spans two floors and a business that's run like a machine, Hatsuhana is a go-to for corporate dining. Though the rave reviews came decades ago, their traditional Edomae sushi still holds its own. Fish is top quality, the army of chefs have solid knife skills, and rice is properly prepared. This reliability draws a host of regulars who develop relationships with the itamae. Stick to the counter and go omakase: the sushi will be surprisingly impressive with accommodations for the spicy tuna-set. Table service can be bumbling with reduced quality, but there is the menu of cooked items on offer to cool frustrations.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10017-Hatsuhana-443549-41102
515,Hell's Kitchen,Cuisine Mexican,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Effortlessly cozy and always friendly, Hell's Kitchen is loved for its bold, satisfying meals. Bare-wood tables, exposed bricks, and chandeliers cleverly made of wine bottles enhance the undeniably jovial space. An orange-tiled bar, wall of banquettes, and spacious booths ensure seating for any size group. Start with a martini glass filled with slices of tender raw steak ceviche in limey marinade with red onion, tomato, and chopped cilantro, served with ancho chili-dusted house chips. Then, move on to the agave-marinated pork loin, moist and glistening over a mound of buttery white rice and grilled vegetables-though the star of that dish (and many others) is the rust-colored mole. Sauces here are flavor-forward, incredibly complex, and a clear highlight.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-Hell_s_Kitchen-69772-41102
516,Del Frisco's,Cuisine Steakhouse,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"Prime, aged, corn-fed beef is the main attraction at this sprawling, outrageously successful outpost of the Dallas-based steakhouse chain. Portions range from the petite filet to a 24-ounce Porterhouse that will make any Texan proud. The menu begins with a suitably rich feast of cheesesteak egg rolls or white clam flatbread; but then does an about face with a knife-and-fork Caesar salad. Lunch is an affordable way to sample their classics. Complementing its McGraw-Hill Building home, Del Frisco's flaunts a masculine look with a large L-shaped bar, dramatic wrought-iron balcony, wood accents, and towering windows. The mezzanine dining area, accessible by a sweeping staircase, enjoys a quieter ambience. Del Frisco's Grille in Rockefeller Plaza is another option.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10020-Del_Frisco_s-113347-41102
517,Oceana,Cuisine Seafood,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"A more apposite name would be hard to imagine and that's not just because this restaurant serves the bounty of the sea; it also stretches out as far as the eye can see. Get a table in the far corner and you may feel you've sailed to distant shores, while the sheer scale of the room may leave you feeling mildly Lilliputian. Come during the day and you'll witness Corporate America at lunch-and they clearly appreciate the efficiency with which it's run. The menu offers enough choice to satisfy the most demanding of sea dogs: there are oysters and lobsters, classics and more contemporary offerings; there are dishes for two like salt-baked mackerel or paella and, for those who fancy themselves as hunter-gatherers, whole fish.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10020-Oceana-270937-41102
518,Pampano,Cuisine Mexican,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Nothing screams you need a trip to Acapulco like a stressful day in midtown, and we've got your remedy. Pampano, a popular Mexican seafood restaurant, offers two types of oases for the weary worker: downstairs, you'll find a lively bar (especially come happy hour) with a few small tables to enjoy their botanas menu; upstairs, you'll find a transporting, beachy dining space with whitewashed ceilings, wicker chairs, lazy ceiling fans, and an outdoor patio. Don't miss the fresh guacamole; excellent rotating list of ceviches, plump with off-the-boat fish and humming with bright lime; or grilled grouper, marinated in achiote and wrapped in banana leaf. Next door, Pampano Taqueria keeps the hungry lunch crowds at bay with delicious tacos on the fly.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10017-Pampano-69679-41102

Good standard.","Chiapas. Puebla. San Luis Potosí. One can literally taste the regions and cities that Chef Cosme Aguilar's amazingly complex menu explores-including his own childhood recipes to honor his mother's memory. A steady stream of hungry diners seeks out this rather small, tasteful dining room for friendly yet professional service and soul-warming fare. Aim for the large, fantastic communal table. Start your meal with hearty rajas con crema, combining none-too-spicy poblanos with sweet, fresh corn, Mexican sour cream, and cheese served alongside a stack of fresh and slightly toasty tortillas. This kitchen's tender chicken enchiladas with mole de Piaxtala may induce swooning, thanks to a sauce that is unexpectedly sweet yet heady with bitter chocolate, raisins, almonds, cloves, cinnamon, chilies, garlic, sesame, and so much more, with incomparable results. It's the kind of food that thrills palates (and tempts wanton thoughts). Expect the chamarros de borrego al huaxamole to arrive falling off the bone and redolent of epazote, allspice, and pulla chilies. Its fruity-spicy broth is drinkable. Every bit of every spongy and buttery layer of the cow and goat's milk pastel tres leches is absolutely worth the indulgence.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Long_Island_City-11101-Casa_Enrique-367784-41102
520,Smith & Wollensky,Cuisine Steakhouse,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Good standard.,"Sitting proudly on the corner of Third Avenue for nearly 40 years, Smith & Wollensky is a veritable New York institution. This is the kind of clubby steakhouse where stellar martinis are still poured tableside and the regulars get their names engraved on a plaque. It's where business deals go down and old-time Manhattanites live it up. Begin with beloved classics, including a beefsteak tomato-and-onion salad finished with house dressing and crumbled blue cheese; or spoon-licking sides like creamed spinach, crispy hash browns, and crunchy onion rings. Then, allow the adept servers to steer you towards the in-house favorite-namely, a beautifully marbled, deliciously fatty, and perfectly tender Colorado rib steak, bone-on and big enough for three.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10022-Smith_Wollensky-113349-41102
521,The Sea Grill,Cuisine Seafood,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"This seafood-centric grill looks onto the iconic Rockefeller Center ice-skating rink and is framed by a wall of windows. Inside, find a cool aqua-accented space that inspires dressing up. Yes, tourists flock here after a spin on the ice, but it is also popular among business crowds-especially at lunch when the bar is bustling with sharp suits munching on lobster tail with a martini on the side. The food itself is light and fresh. In-season you may find soft-shelled crab, served alongside a seaweed salad with citrus-marinated hearts of palm. The Northeast supplies many local seafood choices, such as the Block Island golden snapper a la plancha, with tangy cherry-tomato vinaigrette. Dependable and familiar classics like jumbo lump crab cakes are also on offer.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10020-The_Sea_Grill-69517-41102

The convenient location ensures that every large white-clothed table in the dining room is routinely full, and spot-on service delivered by smartly attired team keeps the mood upbeat. When it comes to the food, the menu chooses homey Italian comforts over theatrics. Homemade stuffed fresh mozzarella allows the character of each ingredient-peppery arugula, roasted eggplant-to shine. Don't miss a selection of pasta fatta in casa. Entrées include a tender, juicy, expertly pounded veal chop with wedges of crisply roasted potatoes and a zippy chopped tomato and black olive salad. Finish with a warm and buttery inverted apple tart topped by vanilla ice cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-La_Masseria-69755-41102
523,Bukhara Grill,Cuisine Indian,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"In NYC's ever-expanding realm of Indian dining, Bukhara Grill has stood the test of time with excellence. Glimpse their expert chefs who seem contentedly trapped behind a glass kitchen wall. Featuring a noisy and yuppie set, this tri-level space is decorated (albeit oddly) with clunky wooden booths, closely set tables, and private rooms. Peek into the kitchen for a whiff of tandoori treats and Mughlai specialties. Dahi aloo papri or spicy potatoes and chickpeas tossed in yogurt and tamarind is a predictably perfect starter. The signature, wickedly creamy dal Bukhara will have you coming back for more (tomorrow). Even if the service may range from sweet to clumsy, hand-crafted breads meant to sop up the likes of sarson ka saag remain a crowning glory.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10017-Bukhara_Grill-257880-41102
524,Sake Bar Hagi,Cuisine Japanese,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"This basement izakaya can be a challenge to locate-its name is slyly marked on a door that opens to a flight of stairs. Descend to find an unremarkable, brightly lit, and boisterous room tightly packed with wood furnishings and a strong Japanese following. The space may be small but the menu is vast, so bring friends to ensure a fulfilling experience. Their spot-on small plates are designed to be washed down by beer, sake, or distinctly Japanese cocktails like cassis with oolong tea or soda, or a Calpico sour. Be sure to include wasabi-spiked shu mai stuffed with ground pork; or takoyaki, deep-fried octopus croquettes with daikon and grated ginger root. Spicy cod roe fried rice and grilled hamachi collar with a light squeeze of lemon are other standouts.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Sake_Bar_Hagi-404301-41102
525,Sip Sak,Cuisine Turkish,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"The celadon façade of this tiny Turkish treasure with its frosted glass awning and art nouveau look holds its own in mundane midtown. Walls lined with large mirrors and a shiny pressed-tin ceiling stand over an armada of cool white marble-topped tables and bentwood bistro chairs. The décor seems French, but the cuisine leads to the Eastern Mediterranean with a definite stop in Turkey. A central, fully stocked bar serves as the launching point for Chef Orhan Yegen, who can be seen (and heard) directing his staff as they entice diners with a meze of citrusy olives, delicious hummus, garlicky cacik, and creamy tarama. House specials like rustic braised lamb chunks set atop a smooth eggplant purée seem straightforward but are deeply comforting.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10017-Sip_Sak-122821-41102

The namesake margarita is an upscale, top-shelf refresher made with fresh lime juice and agave nectar that pairs perfectly with just about anything from the kitchen. Ceviche, small plates, and tacos are all to be enjoyed with gusto. Start with the guacamole trio featuring traditional, pineapple-chipotle, and tomatillo-charred poblano variations. Then move on to a warm mushroom salad with wilted watercress, brown butter, and Berkshire pork chorizo. Pumpkin tamale is an outstanding deconstructed square of smashed kabocha squash, lamb barbacoa, and crema inside a banana leaf.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-Anejo-366495-41102

The ethereal space is all gleaming white surfaces and colorful mood lighting; whole fish are displayed on ice, and an onyx reflecting pool sits in the center of it all. Limani's dressed-up crowd nibbles on contemporary Hellenic delights executed with aplomb. The raw bar offers icy treats-oysters, sashimi, and ceviche-and globally sourced catch is the foundation of cooked preparations, like grilled Canadian halibut dressed with olive oil and capers. Gigantes cooked in a tomato sauce redolent of dill and anise are a worthy side dish; while karidopita, spiced walnut cake soaked with honey, makes for a sweet Greek finish.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10111-Limani-468093-41102

Simple standard.","With its lineup of traditionally prepared comfort food, this steamy joint kicks Hell's Kitchen's Chinese competitors to the curb. Set among the bright lights of the Theater District yet more indicative of the noodle houses found south of Canal Street or along Flushing Avenue, the perpetually packed gem offers a so-so ambience but very friendly service. Hand-pulled and hand-cut noodles are stir-fried with a number of mouthwatering accompaniments; while the dumpling variety is so great it's almost impossible to focus. Herb-spiked pork and shrimp wonton soup is well worth the 20-minute wait, allowing diners plenty of time to devour pan-fried Peking duck bundles and scallion pancakes stuffed with sliced beef; or steamed buns full of mushroom and bok choy.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Kung_Fu_Little_Steamed_Buns_Ramen-472172-41102
529,Talde,Cuisine Asian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This corner of Park Slope is the domain of Chef Dale Talde, whose forte for cooking creative pan-Asian delights at glitzy hot spots has been astutely translated. Carved woodwork and figurines define this sexy venue that, by virtue of its location, is also family-friendly. His menu invokes the flavors of China, Japan, Thailand, Korea, as well as the Philippines. Wonton noodle soup is not to be missed: pork-and-chive dumplings poached in a rich, cloudy broth stocked with springy noodles, tender pork shoulder, wilted greens, and a six-minute egg. Miso-marinated salmon is plated with puffed bulgur, pickled plums, and salsa verde; while local corn is tossed with long beans and lemongrass-Kaffir lime butter for a light yet delightful bite.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11215-Talde-366521-41102

Dishes are layered with flavor, including chewy herb spaetzle and wilted greens topped with grilled lamb sausage and mustard seeds. Pickled red cabbage tops a pork chop sliced off the bone, with a light yet delish potato gratin on the side. High-minded desserts may include a warm carrot cake with fragrant cardamom syrup.

Our best addresses.,"True, some New Yorkers may think of this place as kind of touristy, but this is quintessential brasserie cooking in an equally quintessential Manhattan setting at the base of Rockefeller Center, overlooking its plaza. There is little debate that this French bijou offers some of the best people-watching around. The décor pays homage to its art deco namesake, Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann, through edgy lines and geometric prints. Some dishes may be on the menu more for pleasing the crowds than reflecting tradition (hence the sushi rolls). Still, the croque monsieur is everything you dream it to be-impossibly rich with paper-thin and salty jambon de Paris, creamy béchamel, and a dangerously good layering of melted Gruyère over thick slices of brioche.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10111-Brasserie_Ruhlmann-165116-41102

Local sea scallops are presented raw and chopped atop slices of roasted sweet potato and dressed with spicy mayonnaise, nori powder, and crumbled house-made oyster crackers. Meanwhile, John Dory has an Indian accent-marinated in spiced yogurt, then roasted and plated with a chana masala of green garbanzo beans.

Let the day's catch dictate your meal and take a seat at the counter, where only the glassed-in display of fish and mollusks separates you from this team of skilled, disciplined chefs. The omakase may be wildly varied depending on the day (and your chef), but high standards are always maintained and each crunchy morsel is treated with integrity.

Street snack Bombay bhel puri is colorfully seasoned with tamarind water and mango powder-laced chaat masala. Hard-to-find menu items such as bagharey baingan or eggplants simmered in a thick, rich peanut curry, make you feel like you've been let in on a little secret and invited to the neighbor's party.

The lightly fried, wood-fire finished montanara Starita is a house specialty.

Of course, it is only upon the arrival of salty, crunchy frites when your meal will truly start to sing.

Vintage posters hang on the walls and oldies play nostalgically in the background. Sturdy wood tables alongside large windows provide a cozy spot to feast on Austrian comfort food. Old-world classics are executed with care; the expertly fried Wiener schnitzel is brightened with a few wedges of lemon and a side of thin, pickled cucumbers.

Tiny tables are tightly packed into the dim room, where blood-red walls, a black ceiling, and paintings hanging over exposed brick create an intimate feel. Metal fans spin overhead and soft Mexican tunes are almost drowned out by animated conversations. Looking for tacos? Go elsewhere. This menu is more nuanced with such appetizing items as duck zarape, a mound of tender, shredded duck between warm, flaky tortillas and blanketed in a roasted tomato-habanero sauce.

Run with consummate ease by a well-organized team, its influence stretches beyond merely the entertaining of big-hitters and even bigger spenders. But however celebrated, the sine qua non of any self-respecting seafood restaurant must be the ability to cook a piece of fish absolutely perfectly and, in this, Le Bernardin displays deftness and consistency. Just try the luxuriantly buttery wild striped bass and you'll get the idea. ""Almost Raw,"" ""Barely Touched,"" and ""Lightly Cooked"" are the headings under which you'll find an impressive array of dishes. The influences are global but the cooking is underpinned by a mastery of technique; ingredients are of unimpeachable quality and the kitchen has the confidence to never overcrowd a plate so that the fish always remains the star of the show.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Le_Bernardin-69438-41102
543,Print,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Travel to these western hinterlands and breath a whiff of Californian sensibility. Print's home, off the lobby of the Ink48 hotel, has an easy-breezy layout that unites lounging and supping in a space that is pleasantly moody and particularly cozy. The talented team behind this locavore kitchen takes its mission seriously: there is a full time forager on payroll, water is poured into recycled glasses, the kitchen composts, and the menu highlights the provenance of ingredients. Seasonality and simplicity are shown in creations like a wintertime salad of watercress, blood orange, Medjool dates, crushed Marcona almonds, and sherry vinaigrette. During the summer, ride up to the 16th-floor Press lounge for drinks, small plates, and killer views.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10036-Print-280129-41102
544,Jora,Cuisine Peruvian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Peruvian pottery and tapestries set a casually elegant scene at this newcomer, which is quickly earning a loyal following for frothy pisco sours and spicy dishes full of fresh flavor. Beyond the pale limestone façade, the deep, narrow dining room is filled with light from arched windows and boasts a wall covered in river stones as well as a relaxed bar with striking artwork. The diversity of Peruvian cuisine is on tasty display here, from classic dishes like ceviche mixto with slices of crunchy red onion, oversized kernels of corn and sweet potato, to chupe de camarones-a thick, restorative soup of rice, seafood, and gently poached eggs. A juicy skirt steak with sautéed onions, peppers, cilantro, and sweet plantains on the side will satisfy carnivores.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Long_Island_City-11101-Jora-468347-41102
545,Hide-Chan Ramen,Cuisine Japanese,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,"Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking.





Simple standard.","There is a meticulous science and culture to this ramen-ya that has seemingly perfected the customized noodle experience. Two suggestions to novices: dine during off-hours to avoid their mile-long line; and ponder exactly how firm you like your ramen cooked and rich you like your broth before even stepping afoot. The décor may not say much, but the food speaks volumes in terms of authenticity and flavor. Start with steamed buns of succulent pork or pan-fried gyoza, before moving on to enticing mains centered around unbeatable renditions of ramen. Kuro ramen features an intensely nourishing and garlicky tonkotsu broth bobbing with bits of char siu. Meanwhile, health-conscious NYers are in luck, as both vegetable and chicken broth are also on offer here.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10022-Hide_Chan_Ramen-331695-41102
546,Bar Corvo,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Walk by Bar Corvo and sense the goodness that awaits inside. A pane of glass provides a sneak peek at the large marble bar, communal table, penny-tile flooring, and cheerfully retro décor. Its eclectic vibe and artistic touches lead to a spacious garden, perfect for groups, and a culinary experience that keeps lines spilling onto the sidewalk. Here, a house-made aïoli adds a horseradish kick to sublimely tender beef tongue fries-braised in a chicken stock, tossed in a beer and rice-flour batter, and finally fried to perfection. The savory pesce al forno starts with a base of fingerling potatoes and continues with a lightly breaded fillet of hake, baked with cherry tomatoes, black olives, and finished with garlic and herb salmoriglio.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11238-Bar_Corvo-366510-41102
547,Alobar,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This leisurely gastropub radiates old-world appeal through the red brick exterior and dining room adorned with antiques, copper-rimmed architect lamps, and rustic wood tables. From the softly lit, stocked bar to the cozy banquettes, this space has an attention to design that enhances each meal. Most everyone here begins with a selection from the pickled menu-curried apples, mushrooms-perhaps to pair with the house chicken liver or country pâté (sadly, most of the charcuterie is no longer made in-house). From there, the inventive pleasures range from half chicken with roasted sweet yellow corn and chipotle honey to the bacon-chocolate bread pudding oozing with chunks of chocolate, served with salted caramel, crème anglaise, and a satisfying crust.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Long_Island_City-11101-Alobar-360815-41102
548,La Grenouille,Cuisine French,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Very good standard. Our best addresses.,"La Grenouille is a bastion of old-world glamor and manners with an exorbitant budget for floral arrangements. Although this storied enclave still attracts a devoted following, there's always room for local newbies and blinged-out tourists. Everyone looks good in this lavish space, where red velvet banquettes, polished wood veneer, and softly lit tables bathe the room in rose and apricot hues. Classic and classy, this French cuisine deserves high praise. Delicate ravioli is stuffed with chopped lobster hinting of tarragon and dressed with creamy, tart beurre blanc; an exquisitely tender-seared beef filet arrives with pommes Darphin and a lick of perfect sauce au poivre; and for dessert, the île flottante is heaven under a cloud of spun caramel.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10022-La_Grenouille-69127-41102
549,The Four Seasons,Cuisine American,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Excellent standard. Our best addresses.,"The name alone invokes an image straight out of Mad Men-with beautiful sophisticates and well-dressed men rubbing elbows in a posh, mid-century room with mile-high ceilings, breathtaking flower arrangements, and intimate tables circling a center fountain. In real life, The Four Seasons is all that and more, with a rollicking fun seating chart that's a see-and-be-seen affair; excellent (if no longer particularly groundbreaking) food; an impeccable wait staff; and ultra-glamorous décor. Kick things off with exquisitely fresh steak tartare, expertly prepared tableside. Then move on to tender and flaky Dover sole kissed with Hollandaise; followed by a near-perfect soufflé with Grand Marnier.

550,21 Club,Cuisine American,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Fabled 21 Club has been in business for over 85 years, but there's nothing slowing it down. Opened originally as a speakeasy, this New York institution has wined and dined everyone from movie stars and moguls to moneyed city folk. From its lantern-holding jockeys and townhouse exterior, to the leather- and wood-paneled dining room that feels like a step back in time, this is a classic through and through. The menu is a perfect accompaniment to the setting with choices like seared foie gras tinged with mango chutney and spread atop toasted brioche; or a splendid and classic rendition of steak tartare paired with a green salad. Upstairs and in the back, the feel is formal-so for a casual bite with prettier prices, head off the main entrance to Bar 21.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-21_Club-69763-41102

Simple standard.","What began as a pop-up found an insanely popular home behind an unmarked door in this industrial yet residential nook of Long Island City. Lines never cease; arrive early if possible. A thick wood block serves as a communal table in the dining room, where slurpers can witness the focus and dedication of chefs working within an open kitchen in the back. The kitchen's methodical devotion results in a superior bowl of ramen. In the spicy miso ramen, springy noodles (from Sun Noodle) are nested in a red miso and pork based soup of rich bone broth that slowly simmers for over 24 hours. Topped with scallion, ground pork, sesame, and chili oil, it is one of many rewarding bowls. Okonomiyaki are ethereally light, with smoked trout and shaved bonito.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Long_Island_City-11101-Mu_Ramen-468350-41102
552,Braai,Cuisine South African,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"From its ground floor townhouse home, Braai is adored for tantalizing South African cuisine. Two tables sit up front in a snug patio, which dovetails into a long and slender dark wood space. Drawing inspiration from its region, wide planks make up the floors while the arched ceiling is thatched with straw. Yet the African-inspired décor in the dining room, set with marble-topped communal tables, is anything but cliché. The menu is resplendent with new and balanced flavors that are at once evident in frikkadel, a classic dish of baked meatballs in broth; or calamari drenched in a lovely wine-lemon emulsion. Speaking of mainstays, bunny chow, a street treat of lamb curry ladled into a bread bowl, is a favorite here as well as at nearby sib, Xai Xai.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10018-Braai-253722-41102

It's hard to say when it comes to this hot spot, which caters to hockey players, Russian intelligentsia, and vodka aficionados alike. Our bets are on that beautiful vodka selection, available in all kinds of flavors, qualities, and sizes (shot, carafe, or bottle). Nestled into the bustling Theater District, Russian Samovar is both quirky and elegant-with low lighting, glass panels, and musicians tickling the piano and violin. The staff, both attentive and sweet, can walk you through delicious fare like fresh salmon-caviar blini, prepared tableside; pelmeni, tender veal dumplings served with sour cream and honey mustard; or milk-cured Baltic herring, paired with pickled onions, potatoes, and carrots.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Russian_Samovar-122828-41102
554,Thistle Hill Tavern,Cuisine American,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"At this offshoot from the team behind Talde, you can also expect highly creative cooking, but this time the accent is decidedly American. Set along a corner, this is a fine spot for dining alfresco; inside, find a charming assemblage of sports memorabilia and servers flitting around. Locals head to this South Slope tavern to fill up on hearty cooking that hints of the Mediterranean but is best typified by the likes of pulled pork sliders tucked between a bun, stuffed with pickled ramp and spicy mayonnaise; or crunchy fried chicken, drizzled with black pepper country gravy and sided by a cheddar biscuit. Wrap up the contemporary flavors offered here with apple pie. The deep-fried pocket is accompanied by a buttery apple cider sauce and cinnamon gelato.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11222-Thistle_Hill_Tavern-288693-41102
555,Gallagher's,Cuisine Steakhouse,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"A multi-million dollar renovation hasn't glossed over any of Gallagher's iconic character. Walls covered with photos of horses and jockeys harken back to the 85-year-old stallion's former proximity to the old Madison Square Garden. The menu's ""other soup"" is a sly reference held over from Prohibition days; and diners still walk past the window-fronted meat locker where slabs of USDA Prime beef are dry-aged. Gallagher's fresh sparkle is exhibited by the display kitchen, set behind glass panes. The chefs here turn out contemporary-minded fare like hamachi crudo with a yuzu-jalapeño vinaigrette to go with choice cuts of meat grilled over hickory. The rib steak is a bone-in ribeye that arrives mouthwateringly tender with a side of warm and savory house sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Gallagher_s-441658-41102
556,Chevalier,Cuisine Contemporary,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Very good standard.,"Bearded hipsters are not the target market for every new opening. This glamorous brasserie within the Baccarat Hotel is unashamedly geared to the more grown-up members of the city's social scene-those for whom 53rd Street is downtown. The space exudes old-school charm as the dapper waitstaff coddles those Manhattan powerbrokers and their mink-trimmed cohorts. The menu offers a modern re-working of classic French dishes. The clientele are not the sort to be too concerned by prices but at least one can see where the money goes. The scallops, served with comté and morels, are huge and the veal loin with sweetbreads is not for the fainthearted. And as you would expect from a hotel called Baccarat, the glassware is pretty impressive too.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Chevalier-472171-41102
557,Java,Cuisine Indonesian,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"Java's corner in Park Slope has been an enduring first choice for the exotic eats of Indonesia since 1992. Tiny yet tidy, this dark wood-furnished space is brightened by tall windows covered in golden drapery, native artwork, and the smiles of a friendly staff wearing batik aprons. A nibble from the bevy of fried appetizers is certainly recommended. Begin with bakwan or golden-fried corn fritters, but don't forget about the mouthwatering sate-charred skewers of chicken, beef, or seafood brushed with kecap manis and topped with diced tomato and crispy fried shallots. The array of saucy, simmered options includes sambal goring udang: excellent batter-fried shrimp doused in turmeric-tinted coconut milk infused with lemongrass, ginger, and basil.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11215-Java-331711-41102
558,Jukai,Cuisine Japanese,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"If you can't make it to Tokyo by dinnertime, this subterranean den is the next best thing. Smartly styled in wood and bamboo, it's packed with expats lingering over elaborate meals attended to by an amicable staff. The menu is traditional, though the chef's unique influences are well expressed in a massive oyster ""sashimi"" that's sliced in half on the shell and served with a mirin-soy dip and grated radish. To allow for a wide sampling of their top quality sashimi-from fluke and scallop to uni-opt for the tasting menu, and be sure to request the premium shabu-shabu. Thinly sliced Washu is swished in a bubbling dashi and coupled with noodles, bok choy, tofu, mushrooms, and two drinkable dipping sauces-ponzu as well as a signature sesame shabu-shabu sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10022-Jukai-369527-41102

Housed in the basement of the iconic Lever House, this sexy, low-lit space is decked with tufted charcoal bucket seats circling red cocktail tables, wood panels, honeycomb-shaped wine racks, and Warhol-esque artwork. The gracious staff is top-notch. An elegant, Northern Italian menu offers the likes of perfectly roasted, thinly sliced vitello tonnato in that unlikely yet incredibly delicious sauce of tuna, capers, and mayonnaise. Linguine with sea urchin, crab meat, crushed tomato, and peperoncino is generous and beautifully calibrated. To finish, the contemporary millefoglie layers delicate pastry, vanilla Chantilly cream, and raspberry granite.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10022-Casa_Lever-288676-41102

Attractive and smartly designed, its silk panels, pottery, and striking display of spoons are further enhanced by a flattering lighting scheme. Equally impressive are the menu's myriad small plates, each of them a refreshing take on Korean specialties. Blocks of soft tofu are quickly deep-fried and boldly dressed with gochujang and a ginger-scallion vinaigrette. Poached daikon rings accompanied by bok choy, are glazed with a dark and spicy sauce and stacked high for dramatic presentation. Vegetarian highlights include spicy, crispy dumplings filled with tofu, vegetables, and cellophane noodles.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Danji-324015-41102

Inside, chandeliers hang from a beam-lined ceiling, while neat white leather chairs and glass partitions impart an air of elegance. The expansive menu boasts a slew of meze, house specials, and a knockout dinner prix-fixe. Let the feasting begin with samboussek jibneh, a baked pastry bubbling with salty feta and crisp fattoush, tossing crunchy romaine lettuce, cucumber, tomato, and sumac. And that's not all: add on the hugely flavored sujuk-spicy beef sausage-sautéed, sliced, and kissed with lemon for that perfect smack of flavor.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10022-al_Bustan-292479-41102

Designed by Adam Tihany, Remi's slim interior captivates with inlaid wood floors, a striped banquette evoking a gondolier's shirt, Venetian mural, and trio of blown glass chandeliers.

The lengthy menu of Northern Italian specialties is perfectly at home, starting with carciofi alla Veneziana-roasted baby artichoke hearts atop a vibrant herb purée, garnished with pitted black olives, roasted garlic cloves, and pecorino.

A resort-chic vibe echoes through the whitewashed walls, sea-blue accents, and lots of cool marble. But the holiday ends there, as this crowd is all about business-especially at lunch. The fresh, light cuisine begins with beautifully prepared starters like tender, enticingly charred octopus atop chickpeas, roasted pepper, and quick-pickled onions drizzled with lemon and olive oil. Grilled sea bass is a flawless shade of white, salty and crisp-skinned alongside seasonal vegetables like zucchini and buttery pea purée. Finish with the lovely portokalopita topped with a scoop of bittersweet chocolate sorbet boldly flavored with orange.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10022-Nerai-468090-41102

Set within two Beaux Arts townhouses (once home to a Rockefeller family member), the restaurant is an understated sprawl of ivory walls contrasting dark-stained floors and smoky mirrors. The smartly attired staff attends to a buttoned-up crowd digging into pricey but pleasing fare like shaved artichoke salad with organic frisée, lemon, olive oil, and bottarga di muggine. Here, veal scaloppini is a pounded filet layered with grilled eggplant and smoked provolone, alongside braised escarole studded with black olives. Like everything else at Il Gattopardo, the cassata Siciliana-with its candied fruit and bright green almond paste-is a dressed-up take on the classic.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Il_Gattopardo-468091-41102

Bring your appetite to the pretty, narrow space, which features whitewashed brick and taupe walls lined with mirrors and brown leather banquettes, and attempt to choose a version (there are many) of the milky cheese. Can't decide? Our favorites saw it rolled with grilled sweet peppers hinting of anchovies and presented sliced over arugula; as well as diced and stuffed into a trio of golden-brown, crumb-coated arancini filled with sweet pea-studded creamy rice. A salad of avocado and shaved fennel with citrus segments and fresh mint is a refreshing starter, and the short list of entrées indulges with a hearty, oven-baked pasta of the day.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Mozzarella_Vino-441659-41102

Small plates are big here, while medium plates feature tasty sandwiches (crunchy muffulettas stuffed with fontina and cured meats) and shrimp tacos splashed with salsa verde. Pity the lactose intolerant, as cheese (and lots of it) followed by dessert (maybe a pumpkin ice cream ""sandwich"" pecked with brown butter caramel?) are part and parcel of the special experience at this petite place.

Very good standard.","No playful pun, no name-check for grandma, no oblique reference to a geographical landmark-whoever christened this restaurant clearly wanted to attract a certain type of customer. This is not the place when you should order by pointing vaguely at the menu-that way lies trouble because you may find yourself having to re-mortgage your apartment to pay for the 250 grams of Oscetra caviar you've just inadvertently requested. Best leave that section of the carte to the oligarchs and retired dictators and concentrate on the main menu. Here you will find contemporary dishes of surprising delicacy and precision, with a pleasing bias towards wonderful seafood and shellfish, such as scallops with ricotta gnudi, or delicious bluefin tuna with uni and asparagus. You get buzzed in at street level, which adds a bit of mystery to proceedings. Up the stairs and you'll find yourself in a lavish little jewel box, with colorful murals on the wall, Murano chandeliers hanging from an ornate ceiling, and semi-circular booths.

Tasso ham lends a smoky hint of the South to chewy mounds of hand-rolled linguini and tender coins of braised octopus tossed with a chunky puttanesca sauce of tomato, olives, capers, and garlic. Silky, organic chicken liver mousse is served alongside a stack of toasted baguette slices and fennel-apple salad.

So too is the kitchen, whose talented team sends out ambitious preparations like the locally sourced scallop composition pairing carpaccio zested by pink grapefruit and yuzu with seared specimens swiped by sunchoke foam.

A silky, saffron-scented fish soup, accompanied by grated Gruyère, a few croûtes, and pot of rouille is deliciously classic and incredibly sumptuous. But before filling up, be sure to sample the sole meuniere-a delicate fish seared perfectly and served with sautéed spinach leaves.

Contemporary small plates begin with notable cheese offerings like ricotta Ginepro, cold-smoked sheep's milk, and pale yellow Ossau Iraty accompanied by a walnut covered in date-coconut jam and thick, crusty bread from Amy's.

The ""eight jewels with hot paste"" is a mouthwateringly spiced stir-fry of mushrooms, bamboo shoots, wheat gluten, scallops, chicken, and shrimp. Green beans with tofu sheets is a gorgeously simple combo of soybeans and paper-thin ribbons of bean curd skin judiciously bathed in a light, broth-based sauce.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Tang_Pavilion-360772-41102

Expect the room to be packed with a chic, Italian-accented clientele who flock here for blissfully authentic Neapolitan-style pizzas. These are baked to perfect pliability with a bit of char, topped with impeccable ingredients like creamy mozzarella di bufala, broccoli rabe, and sausage.

Evening tasting menus and a wonderful three-course prix-fixe with overlapping options mean that an array of appetites and budgets can be readily accommodated. The dinner hour is when the chef's true style shines most brightly, through clean and unfussy cooking that is a lovely blend of European techniques and Scandinavian flavors. Klädesholmen Matjes herring is reinvented for the modern palate, encrusted in seeds and rye cubes served on a piece of slate, alongside soft-boiled quail eggs, Västerbotten cheese, and a swipe of horseradish. Follow this with a springtime composition of crisp-skinned Arctic char over pea purée, nettles, sweet and snap peas, and a few halved shrimp. Desserts that feature a textural composition of chocolates are a contemporary highlight. Lunch is a low-key, business-like gathering of Swedish meatballs and skagen, but the service is thankfully far less uptight.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10022-Aquavit-68584-41102

Its discreet signage and second floor location feels more Tokyo than Manhattan, J-pop dominates the playlist, and the crowd is a reassuring mix of Japanese-speakers and in-the-know foodies. Best of all is the aroma of sizzling skewers that are deftly prepared over a charcoal fire. It's all about grilled meats here, like buta karashi-pork loin with sweet onion and spicy mustard-but that doesn't mean you should skip yakumi zaru tofu, soft cubes dressed with slivered green onion, bonito flakes, ginger, and ume salt.

Whatever the hype, Mr Chow still has it and Sutton suits along with their wealthy wives party here like it's 1999. Attentive service and flowing drinks keep everything moving as fans nibble away on the well-priced Beijing duck prix-fixe with four starters along with entrées.

When one surveys this luxurious backdrop and the impeccably manicured clientele, it is perhaps something of a surprise to find that the food is adventurous and creative. Chef Bryce Shuman and his kitchen team know all the latest cooking techniques and are not afraid to use them. Ravioli with smoked potato shows off their delicate touch but the grilled short rib demonstrates that they also know how to create layers of flavor. The menu comes in four sections and one is gently encouraged to have all four, although the hors d'oeuvres are meant more for sharing with a drink.

607,Loi Estiatorio,Cuisine Greek,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Chef, cookbook authority, and restaurateur Marisa Loi has moved her refined take on traditional Greek cuisine to this new address, formerly the home of Seäsonal. The room is minimally revamped, with dark leather furnishings and panoramic photos of sun-bleached coastline that hang on the pale walls. Lovers of Greek cuisine will revel in the cooking's familiar scents and flavors, while marveling at the kitchen's unique, inspired spin. It's possible to feast on starters alone like ladolemono-dressed grilled octopus with fava bean purée, or papoutsakia (stuffed eggplant topped with caramelized béchamel sauce). But, don't overlook the entrées-rooster, braised in red wine as well as spiced tomato sauce and served over Greek pasta, is especially decadent.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Loi_Estiatorio-472173-41102
608,Felidia,Cuisine Italian,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Very good standard.,"Cookbook author, television series host, and restaurateur Lidia Bastianich has been behind this flagship restaurant and greeting customers since 1981. Service could use a little finesse and some of Bastianich's charm, but the elegant décor inspires dressing up for dinner and the exceptional wine list offers a vast collection of Italian choices. Signature paste sparkle here, such as cacio e pere ravioli stuffed with delicate pear and bathed in black pepper and pecorino. Massive portions of scallops, squid, a split langoustine, and lobster star in the grigliata drizzled with lemon vinaigrette. Rely on Lidia to deliver a cannoli that lives up to its true potential-envision narrow tubes filled with lemony ricotta cream spilling into the center of the plate.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10022-Felidia-69117-41102
609,Bistro Vendôme,Cuisine French,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"The nearby residents of Sutton Place fit Bistro Vendôme, a classic sort of spot where three cozy dining rooms, top-notch service, and excellent food come together seamlessly. Often glimpsed gliding across the restaurant, the husband-and-wife owners warmly cater to locals during pleasant but humming dinner hours. The space makes everyone feel lucky-such solid dining options don't typically exist this far east. Familiar and well-done classics may include an enjoyably but never over-whelmingly flavorful fish soup sided with Gruyère cheese, rouille, and croûtes. The well-executed striped bass arrives with a bed of zucchini cooked in a fragrant tomato-saffron broth; while an ile flottante with caramel sauce is like an ode to a Parisian bistro.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10022-Bistro_Vendome-324012-41102
610,Bottega del Vino,Cuisine Italian,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Good standard.,"For true Northern Italian elegance, Bottega del Vino is divine, no matter the time of day. In front, casual Bar Quadronno caters to local business people looking to meet for a European-style breakfast, light lunch, or unbeatable cappuccino. Head to the more formal, rear dining room with tables dressed in white to savor a very authentic Italian meal. Veronese influence is clear from the start, with dishes like whole grilled calamari served simply over a bed of arugula drizzled in excellent olive oil with a splash of lemon. The pillowy spinach and potato gnocchi swimming in a creamy sauce with crisp prosciutto and pecorino outdoes most other plates like it in the city. Finish with warm Nutella-filled crêpes served with vanilla ice cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10022-Bottega_del_Vino-113836-41102

Very good standard. Our best addresses.","There are some restaurants that have a discernible pulse that makes you immediately aware you've arrived somewhere a little special. At this elegant and refined Italian restaurant you aren't so much as welcomed in as taken in hand and enveloped in a sort of benevolent bubble of care. It's a grown up establishment with a suitably urbane clientele who all look at home in this part of town. Sit in the main dining room where all the action happens, rather than in the alcove off the bar-which is undoubtedly-Siberia. As the name suggests, seafood and shellfish lie at the heart of the menu. And needless to say, the ingredients are not only of irreproachable quality but are also treated with respect and deftness by the kitchen, whether it's the brilliant white halibut or the salt-baked wild bass. Start with the crudo, and then head for a generous bowl of homemade pasta such as tagliolini with clams and calamari, followed by a whole fish or a classic entrée. It's not of course compulsory to stick to fish-the lamb chops make a worthy alternative. The wine list is a deserving tome and along with the big names are some lesser known growers who merit investigation.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Marea-259127-41102
612,Anassa Taverna,Cuisine Greek,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Two floors of whitewashed brick walls and large windows dressed with sheer drapery provide a respite for weary shoppers and a sociable clientele at this contemporary taverna. The upstairs dining room is sedate, but remains your best bet when crowds pack the ground-level bar area. Anassa's menu is an honest presentation of Greek specialties, including a platter of spreads, sushi-quality charcoal-broiled octopus, and a selection of Mediterranean and North Atlantic fish to be grilled and dressed with extra virgin olive oil, fresh lemon, and capers. Nightly specials add further variety to the extensive menu. Don't miss Wednesday's luscious slow-roasted pork shoulder served fork-tender in a parchment bundle with fresh herbs and wedges of lemon potatoes.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10022-Anassa_Taverna-468089-41102

Exceptional standard. Our best addresses.","There is no more dramatic departure from the soulless Time Warner Center than entering through the iconic blue doors to Per Se. An upscale sense of calm-the kind that only money can buy-instantly soaks the atmosphere. The words posh and exclusive come to mind when admiring the spacious tables, corner banquettes, and stunning views. Chef Thomas Keller continues to raise the bar with meals that express artistry and seasonality right down to the moment. A classic since day one, the ""oysters and pearls"" still swim in that bath of luxurious caviar. Summery flavors reach their peak in the beautiful roulade of veal breast en persillade. The extraordinary vegetable tasting menu will threaten to convert the most die-hard omnivore with chestnut- and mascarpone-filled agnolotti dressed with julienned Tuscan kale and pickled Swiss chard stems. Flavors and textures may temporarily veer off into strange (and slow) territory during cheese and dessert courses. While this innovative and creative vision may delight some, it will confound others. No matter. The celebrated ""coffee and doughnuts"" is a grand finale. Those without reservations can stop at the opulent Salon, where much of the menu is available à la carte.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Per_Se-69452-41102

Good standard. Our best addresses.","To taste what may be the continent's best sushi, experience the quiet, contemplative, and very exclusive ceremony of Chef Masa Takayama's omakase. Through the heavy wooden door, discover a room that is as unchanging and calming as a river stone, set amid blonde hinoki wood and a gargantuan forsythia tree. Yes, you'll forget it's on the fourth floor of a mall. Attention to detail is unsurpassed; that bespoke Japanese porcelain seems designed specifically for the sweet shrimp it holds. Service displays the same smooth grace, unobtrusive yet at-the-ready with their hot towels, fingerbowls, tea, and touches of pedagogy or insight. Don't let their tendency to upsell extra courses mar your pleasure. A seaweed salad of vinegar-seasoned jellyfish awakens the palate to the subtle progression of courses that follow. Masterful proportion and elemental balance is unparalleled in the mind-melting toro tartare with salty grains of Californian osetra caviar and toasted bread for crunch. Yet Masa truly distinguishes itself with its parade of sushi showcasing the best of Tokyo's Tsukiji market. Expect phenomenal aji mackerel with grated yuzu, traditional unagi, and an indelible finish of toro temaki.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Masa-69756-41102
615,Bar Masa,Cuisine Japanese,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"Make no mistake: Masa's adjacent lounge is by no means a bargain substitute for the stunner next door. Bar Masa remains as hopping as when it first opened, and on any given night every tightly packed seat is perpetually filled-thanks in part to a no-reservations policy. Despite the crowds, softly lit Japanese limestone walls give the room an air of serenity. The long list of creative sips are excellent, so lay your lips on a cucumber mint gimlet while eagerly awaiting selections off the extensive menu. Serious effort is blatantly apparent: raw petals of sakura trout are tantalizingly dressed; pudding-soft tofu and perfectly ripe avocado are a heavenly pairing for an uramaki; and fluffy wild mushroom fried rice is sprinkled with wasabi salt.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Bar_Masa-113345-41102
616,Porter House,Cuisine Steakhouse,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,Very good standard.,"Michael Lomonaco's flagship steakhouse offers unparalleled views of Central Park from its Time Warner Center perch. Here, tables are well-spaced and allow for fine dining, but look for those few intimate booths located in the front bar area-they make for a great escape on busy nights. The views certainly distinguish this handsome retreat from the pack, as do its carefully selected aged meats, quality fish, and expert sides. The kitchen puts out a tasty helping of sweet and spicy onion rings, buttermilk-battered and deep-fried in portions designed for linebackers. The beautifully marbled ribeye is aged for more than 45 days and would be delicious simply seared, though a chili rub adds an aggressive spice. Cool down with a lightly dressed purslane salad.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Porter_House-184984-41102
617,The Regency Bar & Grill,Cuisine Contemporary,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"The Loews Regency now serves up a contemporary vision of hotel dining that can stand entirely on its own. Fully-stocked glass-and-metal shelves at the bar invites passersby to ditch Park Avenue for a cocktail before sinking into the plush dining room, where ivory leather and sky-blue velvet seating is laid out over carpeting inspired by Italian mosaic tiles. The setting's fresh face is a fitting home for Chef Dan Silverman's au courant cuisine in which shaved radishes and julienned snow peas are combined with pickled shiitake mushrooms and sesame dressing for an inspired salad. Grilled double-cut lamb loin chop, cooked perfectly to spec and plated with a stack of panisse- and mint-infused béarnaise sauce, is a sweet dream in the making.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10065-The_Regency_Bar_Grill-441662-41102

This railcar-sized space is set along a traffic-clogged stretch, but once inside, the ambience is sweet with espresso-tinted wood furnishings set against cream walls and exposed brick. Petite pizzas baked in the wood-fired oven arrive bearing fresh mozzarella, spicy 'nduja, and fava beans, among other tasty combinations. Starters include gallette, chickpea flour fritters stacked with stracciatella and shaved prosciutto, drizzled with fig syrup, and stuck with a sprig of rosemary. Enjoyable primi include risotto studded with diced artichokes, pancetta, and showered with shaved black truffle. Desserts like the lemon-soaked delizia al limone are homespun delights.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10065-Tiella-324029-41102
619,Nougatine,Cuisine Contemporary,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard. Our best addresses.,"Nougatine is a bright, stylish, and contemporary space on the ground floor of the Trump International Hotel bookended by an open kitchen at one end and a huge picture window the other. What really sets it apart, however, is the service: the restaurant is run with lots of flair and no little professionalism by a vast army of servers-this is not one of the places where you need to use semaphore to get noticed by your waiter. The food is light and current and the lunch menu, with dishes taken from the main à la carte, is a positive steal-although the immaculately coiffured clientele did not seem the sort to be overly concerned by the concept of a bargain. Dishes like veal Milanese are confidently executed and it's worth leaving room for desserts, like apple tart.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10023-Nougatine-336509-41102
620,Jean-Georges,Cuisine Contemporary,From 75 USD    to 150 USD,"Three MICHELIN stars: unique cuisine. Worth a special trip! 





Excellent standard. Our best addresses.","The crown-jewel restaurant of a crown-jewel Trump hotel, Jean-Georges reigns supreme over the Central Park dining scene. Facing its lush grounds and mighty Columbus himself, the restaurant's separate entrance can be something of a whirlwind as guests must pass through buzzing Nougatine to arrive at this silver-gray dining room. Still, those immense windows, columns, and twinkling skyline views make this a very special place. On weekdays, the feel is formal and business-driven, while weekends hum with affluent tourists, local socialites, and an easier vibe. The highly professional service staff is one well-oiled and smooth machine. While the contemporary menu is fixed, options are numerous and particularly appealing. Let the fascinating interplay of flavors begin with sea trout and oyster tartare merged with horseradish cream, lemon, and chive oil. Simple but lavish elegance underscores a perfectly cooked Maine lobster accompanied by roasted chili paste. Composed with Asian flavors and French technique, this is a standout worthy of a special occasion. And in place of a single, haunting finale, desserts are served as a ""sampler"" focused on one ingredient-say caramel-in all its outrageous glory.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10023-Jean_Georges-70381-41102
621,El Porrón,Cuisine Spanish,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Black-and-white portraits of people pouring streams of wine into their mouths directly from porróns-blown glass wine vessels with long, tapered spouts-give you the idea of what this spot is all about. Dark colors give a cloistered feel to the intimate space, which is a pleasant contrast to its traffic-clogged location. The kitchen churns out a graceful, all-encompassing array of tapas, large plates, and even paellas worth their 40-minute wait. Sample bites like canned esparragos blancos Navarro-their thick, tender stalks are served cool and dressed with Chardonnay vinaigrette-or bacalao a la Vizcaina, Basque-style salt cod with a sauce melding the flavors of roasted peppers, garlic, olives, and potatoes served in a bubbling hot cazuela.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10065-El_Porron-290215-41102
622,The Nuaa,Cuisine Thai,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"The Nuaa offers a certain sultry vibe to this rather blah, trafficky stretch-it's dim and moody even in the middle of the day. Shimmering gold accents pop against the room's brown leather seating, carved woodwork, and dark palette. Fans of Thai cuisine will enjoy the pleasantly pungent notes throughout the selection of salads and noodle dishes. Crunchy curried rice salad features deep-fried nuggets strewn with Thai sausage and lemongrass served with plenty of shallots, long beans, and lettuce, and a drizzle of Kaffir lime-mint vinaigrette. The kanom jeen features thin rice noodles soaked in a mildly spiced coconut-rich yellow curry that is generously stocked with huge lumps of crab meat, chopped pickled mustard greens, and caper berries.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10065-The_Nuaa-399650-41102
623,Fishtail by David Burke,Cuisine Seafood,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"First-rate seafood served in a ritzy, residential townhouse makes Fishtail a perennial hot spot. The first floor is an oyster bar and lounge swamped by after-work crowds devouring iced shellfish towers. Upstairs, find a deep-red dining room with touches that colorfully convey the ocean theme. Fresh-off-the-boat seafood is prepared with the eponymous chef's trademark stamp of creativity, resulting in dishes like pastrami-spiced smoked salmon. These gossamer slices are drizzled with horseradish crème fraîche and mustard oil, topped with fried capers, and accompanied by chewy slices of toasted pretzel. Entrées include an Asian-themed steamed black cod brushed with tamarind glaze and plated with turnip-lap cheong (Chinese sausage) cake.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10065-Fishtail_by_David_Burke-258395-41102
624,Fig & Olive,Cuisine Mediterranean,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"This reliable, Mediterranean-inspired retreat is a popular post-museum (or post-shopping) pick. The sleek long bar glows beneath dangling light fixtures, while the shelf-lined walls are stocked with olive oils in verdant hues of green. Candles flicker over stone tables near plates of glistening olives. An olive oil tasting showcases the stark nuances of different regions and makes an ideal start to a meal, served with fluffy rosemary fougasse. Then, move on to buttery, round tartlets of Gorgonzola dolce, caramelized figs, and chopped walnuts with a pile of arugula lending peppery spark. Nutty, truffle-infused risotto with meaty mushrooms is a high note. A shot glass of luscious chocolate mousse compensates for its paltry size with absolute decadence.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10021-Fig_Olive-70372-41102

Bay Area food enthusiasts might recognize Chef/owner Henry Trieu from his days cooking at the popular Slanted Door; here at Falansai, a pretty little nook that feels miles from the gritty streets surrounding it, Trieu elevates the already complex Vietnamese cuisine to the next level. The results will knock your socks off-honestly, you might never look at a bánh mì the same way again. Don't miss the tender shrimp fritters, enveloped in mashed cassava and chilies; fresh papaya salad laced with mint leaves, sweet poached shrimp, and crushed toasted peanuts; or a surprisingly complex and special coconut curry bobbing with sweet kabocha squash, Thai eggplant, and tender carrots.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11237-Falansai-406584-41102

Our best addresses.,"Paying homage to the UK with a distinctly edgy spirit, Dear Bushwick is a slim, snug favorite for deliciously hearty cooking that is mingled with contemporary inflections. A handsome curving copper bar is beloved by solo diners, while hanging birdcages, a pressed-tin ceiling, and vintage portraits of sheep, kings, and churches keep the overall vibe groovy. The English-inspired menu features such devourable delights as braised ox tongue set atop navy beans and a beet green salad, but vegetarian dishes like cauliflower hash with silky potatoes, crisp granny smith apples, and a spiced curry yogurt are equally robust. Finish, of course, with a perfect Yorkshire pudding, topped with chocolate sauce, crumbled walnuts, and candied orange peel.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11237-Dear_Bushwick-399657-41102

Larger than its previous digs, Park Avenue is a sprawling canvas on which design firm AvroKO works its magic. The restaurant remains a family affair, with father and son Alan and Michael Stillman steadily steering the concept alongside Chef/partner Craig Koketsu. Just like the décor, the menu fully celebrates the seasons. Hearty wintertime flavors have featured mustard seed vinaigrette, Manchego, and chestnut honey-drizzled kale-and-chorizo salad. The whimsical ""everything"" crusted branzino is set on a smear of smoked cream cheese; while sticky toffee pudding is graced with brûléed bananas.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10010-Park_Avenue-468074-41102

It may seem like a simple restaurant for a very good spicy tuna roll, but their excellent and unique omakase is what put it on the map as a worthy favorite. The quality and creativity of each bite shows the chef's training at Sushi of Gari, with added twists. Sample excellent toro chopped with ginger that is at once tender, fatty, and crunchy over rice; or a slice of fatty salmon with avocado sauce. Don't miss the signature hand roll of toasted nori surrounding juicy chopped scallop with crunchy tempura flakes, tobiko, and spicy mayo.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10021-Sushi_Seki-68299-41102

Back issues of Paris Match (and other French-language titles) double as menu covers. Speaking of which, be sure to peruse the Alsatian tarte flambée offerings. Cette cousine of pizza features a thin, flaky crust presented with an array of toppings. Traditionalists should go for the l'authentique loaded with crème fraîche, lardons, onions, and Gruyère. The remainder of the menu also offers enjoyable specials like sienna-hued soupe de poisson, a lush coalescence of seafood, saffron, orange peel, tomato, and herbs.

Good standard. Our best addresses.","At this ultra-hip gastropub in Long Island City, first impressions can be wildly deceiving. At first, you'll wonder if you got the right address: from the outside, M. Wells Steakhouse looks like the old auto body garage it's housed in, but step inside and wow-the interior is all gloss and swagger, from its gold-and-black wallpapered ceiling and dripping crystal chandeliers, to its sexy red walls, stunning bar area, and open, wood-burning kitchen. Service is friendly and just as polished and charming as the design; though mercifully more earnest than hip. They seem refreshingly invested in your experience, dropping dishes with explanations; checking in regularly; and genuinely thanking you for your patronage. Don't miss the opportunity to drill them on wine pairing ideas. Their answers are thoughtful and spot-on. M. Wells may bill itself as a steakhouse, but the excellent raw bar, fresh fish entrées, and unique appetizers are up for some serious best supporting nods.

Here in NYC, Moti Mahal Delux offers two distinct seating areas: an earth-toned dining room and windowed sidewalk atrium. Their Northern dominated cuisine traces back to the kitchens of the Mughal Empire, which brought Muslim influences to the Indo subcontinent. Tasty tandoori preparations factor heavily, like anardana tikka-grilled white meat chicken infused with a pomegranate and black pepper marinade. Delightful flavors abound through the home-style mutton curry showcasing a brick-red sauce of spiced tomato, onion, and ginger; hot paratha dusted with dried mint; and mustard seed- and curry leaf-infused lemon rice.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10065-Moti_Mahal_Delux-399649-41102

Within Jojo's snug townhouse quarters, ritzy locals and well-heeled tourists dine at elegantly dressed tables-think starched linens and polished silver-amid terra-cotta tile floors, plum velvet banquettes, and toile drapery. The look isn't fresh or exciting, but the cuisine makes up for it.

Exceptional standard. Our best addresses.","The elegant façade, the revolving door, the sound of clinking glasses-even before you reach the dining room you feel a part of something special. This bastion of classical French cooking epitomises the ""special occasion,"" yet even those unencumbered by fiscal considerations treat it with respect. The dining room is dominated by the striking porcelain-tiled chandeliers hanging from the soaring ceiling. If you're on one of the raised tables you get to look down-literally rather than patronizingly-onto your fellow diners through the neo-classical arches. Yet thanks to the personable service, the grandeur of the room never stifles the animated atmosphere. The cooking is as sophisticated as the surroundings and the ingredients come from the top drawer. The kitchen has had an obvious classical education yet you never feel it is tied by the tyranny of tradition. Just order the succulent Niman Ranch lamb chops and you'll find them accompanied with quinoa mixed with avocado. Occasionally, over-enthusiastic garnishing can overawe the dish's main ingredient but there's no doubting this is a very capable kitchen.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10065-Daniel-68178-41102

The cozy space is on the ground floor of a brownstone, so the setting is understandably narrow. East Pole's front bar is hopping, while black leather booths in the back allow parties to sit and enjoy an eclectic menu in relative peace. The stimulating cooking here begins with a salad of roasted heirloom carrots with hijiki, diced avocado, and an Asian-inspired soy-and-sesame oil vinaigrette. Then move on to explore Kiev-style chicken, stuffed with garlic butter-enriched broccoli purée, or creamy fish pie stocked with cod, lobster, and fennel.

Good standard.","When the city's best yakitori decided to up and relocate, its Upper East Side neighborhood suffered a crushing culinary loss-one that would soon become midtown's gain. And after a long construction, Tori Shin is finally welcoming both fresh and familiar faces to its brand-new Hell's Kitchen home. A small bar pouring sake, shochu, and Japanese whiskey welcomes patrons into a multi-level dining room where table seating is now offered in abundance-including a clutch of options in a mezzanine room with gorgeous gold leaf walls. Boasting 500-year old hinoki and a serene palette of sand and stone, this is an upscale, sophisticated spin on the original location. What hasn't changed, however, is the quality of the organically raised chicken parts and the expert skill in which they are sizzled over the binchotan-fired grill. Skewers of crisped wing, seared heart, and creamy liver need nothing more than a few grains of salt to express true flavor. Ordering à la carte is a fun way to explore the menu, which offers grilled vegetables and items like chicken cha-shu in addition to omakase-a succulent onslaught of kara-age, chicken and duck tsukune, blistered shisito peppers, and soboro don.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10019-Tori_Shin-195773-41102
638,Bar Boulud,Cuisine French,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Good standard.,"The restaurant that launched Chef Daniel Boulud's Upper West Side trifecta, Bar Boulud's first-class charcuterie and stellar wine list make it an idyllic prelude to any Lincoln Center show. Sit at the communal table with a hefty pour of a rare wine (ask about specials), and gaze at the tunnel-like dining room, crafted to mimic a barrel and clothed with Vik Muniz photographs of abstract wine spills. The wine-centric motif is as clear as the glassware. While their array of sips are winning, meat and cheese boards are equally worthy, thanks to the genius of Gilles Verot. He's responsible for the award-winning fromage de tête (bright and clean in flavor). The rest of the menu is as infallible and includes everything from Provençal rabbit to the Île flottante.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10023-Bar_Boulud-208829-41102
639,Maya,Cuisine Mexican,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Upscale Mexican dining thrives at Chef Richard Sandoval's muy popular Maya. Slick with polished dark wood furnishings, vibrant tiled flooring, and accent walls the color of a ripe mango, this is always a fun scene. Adding to the revelry is the Tequileria, Maya's bar with a serious focus on agave spirits. Antojitos, such as squash blossom quesadillas and their trio of salsas, headline as starters. Tasty tacos are stuffed with smoked brisket and creamy chili slaw. Heartier dishes feature huitlacoche and wild mushroom enchiladas swathed in a creamy, fire-roasted poblano chile sauce. Especialidades like achiote-marinated carne asada with cactus-green bean salad and bacon-wrapped jalapeños display the kitchen's contemporary flair.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10021-Maya-122842-41102
640,Boulud Sud,Cuisine Mediterranean,From 50 USD    to 74 USD,Very good standard.,"Far from a chichi French affair, Chef Daniel Boulud uses this ode to Mediterranean cuisine to explore all sides of the sea-from Morocco to Italy to Turkey and back again. Packed and lively, the dining room is airy with vaulted ceilings, natural lighting, and long striped banquettes. A semi-open kitchen allows a glimpse into the creation of deftly prepared delicacies. The menu here is light yet dense with bright flavor, from the crudo du jour (perhaps cubes of hamachi with gently braised cauliflower, pignoli, white raisins, and herbs) to a tender octopus salad with Marcona almonds, arugula, and Jerez vinegar. Huge morsels of chicken with cous cous, wilted greens, and preserved lemons make a hearty dish, attractively served in a classic tagine vessel.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10023-Boulud_Sud-336508-41102

It's downright adorable. But, it's the delicious food that fills the seats. Still best known for their irresistible pizzas, blistered to puffy perfection, the menu offers all kinds of heavenly dishes not to miss, like the fried calamari and shrimp, served with tangy lemon and aïoli; or a wood-fire roasted side of cauliflower mixed with creamy mascarpone, tart labneh cheese, and Marcona almonds. Just around the corner, at 433 Halsey, a sister bakery serves up fresh pastries and a mean espresso all day.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11233-Saraghina-336868-41102
642,El Mio Cid,Cuisine Spanish,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"In contrast to popular tapas spots sweeping the city, this is an old-guard Iberian stalwart, deep in the heart of Bushwick. The interior bears a Mediterranean sensibility, with idyllic murals of the Spanish countryside, dark wood tables, and huge vessels of refreshing sangria. It has the feel of a relic from another time, when attentive service and a polished dining room were standard. Familiar flavors abound, as in sardinas a la plancha, two fat Portuguese sardines simply grilled and served with a wedge of lemon. The hearty paella Valenciana sees lobster claws, mussels, smoky chicken, chorizo, clams, and roasted peppers folded into a mound of sultry rice. For dessert, opt for torrejas, bread soaked in spiced red wine and served with vanilla ice cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11221-El_Mio_Cid-336864-41102

Add to that a familial staff and fantastic food...et voilà...a fun, energetic, instant favorite! There is a reason why each newcomer becomes a regular: the food is surprisingly delicious and very authentic.

Our best addresses.,"Beside the Lincoln Center's reflecting pool, with its Henry Moore ""Reclining figure"" sculpture, is a space dedicated to art of the culinary variety. With its striking glass frame, swooping turf-topped roof, and sophisticated Italian fare, it provides the ideal spot for pre- and post-show sustenance. The chefs perform in their display kitchen behind a glass screen, but instead of offering a generic menu they choose a different region each month and then showcase its specialities and best known ingredients. So come in, say, May and it could be Sardinia when you can have malloreddus as a pasta course or some mosciame with your linguine. The cooking is robust and generously proportioned, although the care and craftsmanship of previous years is no longer evident.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10023-Lincoln-324033-41102

Good standard.","The dining scene along this industrial corridor where East Williamsburg meets Bushwick is on fire-possibly spurred by the talented chefs who now call this area home. The husband-and-wife behind Faro have years of restaurant experience between them, so it's not surprising that this casual, dependable restaurant serves dishes carefully crafted from well-sourced ingredients. If the goal at Faro is comfort food with integrity, they more than succeed in this mission by pushing out dishes like sweet pea porridge studded with fresh morel mushrooms; and light, chewy gnocchi Sardi dotted with sweet ricotta, braised goat, artichokes, and tomatoes. Round out the repast with an ebony tangle of squid ink chitarra tossed with olive oil, roasted garlic, clams, and mussels.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11237-Faro-472176-41102

Vintage chairs surround bare tables beneath a wood planked ceiling in the pleasantly simple but tight dining room-still popular after all these years. The downstairs area has been transformed into a wine and cocktail bar. Parsnip, carrots, and tender chickpeas feature in a restorative bone soup of clear and beefy broth sprinkled with fresh herbs. A focus on rich, meaty flavors continues in the NEK burger, made with properly seasoned and grilled beef topped with onions, mushroom duxelles, and Vermont cheddar with a side of duck fat fries and tots. Chewy cavatelli is beautifully dressed with a lamb ragù enlivened by shiitakes and kale.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11237-Northeast_Kingdom-336866-41102

Simple standard.","Located along an industrial stretch of Ridgewood, this charismatic Vietnamese restaurant doesn't offer much in the way of location-which is even more reason to suspect the throngs of people clamoring for it to open on a Saturday are here for something special. It's the food, of course, though the funky hipster surf shack interior and warm staff certainly add to the appeal. You really can't miss on bún-ker's menu, a whirlwind of Vietnamese dishes sporting a California-like freshness. But, highlights include the bang-on bánh xèo, a crispy crêpe featuring tender shrimp, bacon, bean sprouts, and fresh herbs; the excellent pho ga bobbing with tender poached chicken, chewy rice noodles, sprouts, lime, and jalapeño; or any of the mouthwatering daily specials.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Ridgewood-11385-bun_ker-404318-41102

The fact that it's surrounded by bodegas and a fast food joint simply adds to the overall intrigue. Owner Amadeus Broger also co-owns the popular Nolita restaurant, Le Philosophe, and here he relies on the same formula that made the latter such a hit: serious food in a fun, casual setting. Don't miss the soufflé au fromage, rendered light and frothy with nutty Comté; the tournedos Rossini, tender filet mignon over a potato pancake, topped with foie gras medallions and finished with Madeira; or the perfectly executed duck a l'orange.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Brooklyn-11221-L_Antagoniste-472179-41102

Very good standard.","There is a reason why we all wish that a Telepan would appear in our own neighborhood-this is among the city's most solid restaurants. With its brownstone charm firmly in place, the impeccable interior has an equally New York feel with cozy rooms, brick, and food-centric artwork decorating the light walls. Every element feels as though it is in smart proportion and lends an airy feel to the space, from the contemporary plates to the petite wood tables. The waitstaff is professional, not overly formal, and genuinely interested in each guest. Classic American elegance shines in a menu that effortlessly balances technique, ingredients, and flavor in perfect measure, while remaining creative and never predictable. Don't miss signature dishes like the lobster Bolognese, served as a whole tail or claws over a massive twirl of beautifully cooked spaghetti with finely chopped lobster meat in a light shallot-garlic-tomato broth that ensures the sauce melds with each bite. A gorgeous fillet of butter-poached turbot, which arrives alongside roasted winter squash made fragrant and sweet with allspice, is then finished with a decadent touch of caviar.

Good standard. Our best addresses.","The ambience of this unselfconscious Spanish dynamo is vibrant and notably personable. Located just below street-level, Andanada is laid-back but still formal, with professional, customer-driven servers attending to your every whim. The crowd is lively yet sophisticated-whether seated at the date-friendly bar, pleasant glass atrium, or brick dining room decorated with memorable bullfighting scenes. Like its surrounds, this noteworthy cuisine arrives much more beautiful than expected-clearly there is modern talent in Chef Manuel Berganza's kitchen. While the chef's creative expression has been met with mixed results of late, each dish can at its best be composed with an eye on innovative cooking as well as classic flavors. Here, Catalan pork sausage is interestingly composed with shaved fennel and a fava bean casserole to elevate each bite. Then, pristine sardines are wrapped around pan con tomate and set over a bed of picada-style sauce for good flavor. Likewise, berenjenas asada is appealingly complex, served as cubed and puréed eggplant, balanced by a honey- and red wine-vinegar reduction. Simple-sounding mushroom croquettes combined with barely pickled mushrooms are gloriously earthy.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10023-Andanada-399651-41102

An all-consuming U-shaped marble bar makes it easy-stay long enough and you're reaching for the menu. Beyond excellent cheese and charcuterie, dishes feature flavorful herbs that perfume a grilled chicken, which comes on a bed of sautéed spinach with white bean ragout and sweet-sour caponata. Basil-scented North Atlantic cod soup swarming with creamy, thinly sliced potatoes hits the spot, as does dessert-maybe a fanned-out poached pear served with a scoop of gianduja-hazelnut gelato?",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10023-Bin_71-257536-41102

Start with a plate of that paper-thin salumi before moving on to enjoyable cooking that includes melanzane roasted until silky soft, capped by grated parmesan turned golden under the broiler, and plated with diced tomatoes and chickpea purée.

653,Café Mingala,Cuisine Burmese,From 13 USD    to 24 USD,Simple standard.,"Café Mingala is a special destination-not simply because this is the only Burmese restaurant in all five boroughs. The cuisine itself is downright addictive and undeniably unique. This cross-cultural cuisine distills the flavors of Myanmar's neighbors-China, India, Thailand, and Malaysia-into its own luscious specialties. The pickled green tea leaf salad combines chopped lettuce, bean sprouts, peanuts, sesame seeds, and bits of tea leaf all dressed with spiced oil and fresh lime. Follow this with mo-goke pork, from the ""land of rubies"" made with tender chunks of meat braised in a salty and sweet dark sauce. Café Mingala's signature dish is a flaky ""thousand-layer"" pancake, or keema, topped with ground beef and potatoes in a turmeric-rich curry.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10021-Cafe_Mingala-360780-41102

Linen-draped tables, spacious banquettes, and big windows facing Second Avenue fashion a look that inspires dressing up (or not). Service is always gracious, if at times earnest. The kitchen shines with its eggplant halim, a creamy, steaming roasted eggplant and onion dip with tender lentils and a dollop of yogurt on top.

This demure space feels tidy and neutral beneath colorful ceiling pendants and wine shelves. A polite staff attends to the familiar coterie of neighborhood patrons. The menu specializes in regional dishes that are spiced to your desired level. Sample rich bowls of keema matar, a thick and meaty stew of minced lamb and sweet peas in a spicy curry paste of dried red chilies, ginger, coriander, and cloves.

Items can be as simple as a piece of deep ocean sea bream brushed with soy sauce and touched with sea salt, or as dressed up as a salt- and vinegar-cured branzini topped with sweet pickled white kelp and marinated cherry leaf.

Salads paired with freshly baked bread comprise their fine lighter fare; while heartier appetites will enjoy a choice of croque monsieur, or perhaps foie gras- and mushroom duxelles-stuffed chicken breast dressed with an intense mushroom jus.

If you want to swap the chaos of the city and its cacophony of car horns for a couple of tranquil hours, then here's where to come.

The front bar is a choice spot to sip and savor from the selection of drafts. The space then opens up to a seating area of marble-topped tables, handsome button-tufted brown leather banquettes, and plush red velvet chairs. Beer-battered haddock and chips with tartar sauce, hearty meat pie of the day, and coronation chicken sandwich-the classic mid-century chicken salad dressed with intensely yellow, curry-tinged mayonnaise on toasted baguette-are a few of the true-blue hits. The vibe is charming, but dinner offers much more ambience than midday service.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10021-Jones_Wood_Foundry-335730-41102

Starr certainly knows how to please a crowd with marvelous salads and Italian-inspired dishes alongside unique wines from some of the country's emerging regions. Though frittata del giorno pocked with red peppers, tomato, and mozzarella, as well as panzanella with creamy burrata are eye-poppingly good, save room for a berry crostata whose flaky crust is perfectly accompanied by a smidge of vanilla ice cream.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10024-Caffe_Storico-366507-41102

A night indulging in his omakase might include delicately seared kanpachi, topped with a lightly poached quail egg; wildly fresh Japanese red snapper paired with pine nuts, bright greens, and fried lotus root; tender, seared toro with garlic and ginger sauce; or perfectly poached yellowtail, laced with sesame sauce and a sprinkle of chives.

Turkish salad is actually a bright red tomato spread shot with harissa and dressed with bits of diced cucumber and a drizzle of excellent olive oil.

It's easy to plow through all the fresh shellfish dishes with a chilled beer and sweet rice, but try to leave room for the clam casserole: a spicy broth full of Cantonese flavors, loads of onions, and small, briny clams, finished with a sprinkling of crisp coriander stems.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Flushing-11354-Imperial_Palace-270960-41102
836,Mario's,Cuisine Italian,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"Does Staten Island really need another Italian-American restaurant? A fair question, but Chef/owner Mario Gentile confirms the answer is a yes. And, after a bite or two of his delicious red sauce food, you might be inclined to agree. Sprawled on a stretch of Richmond Road dotted with florists and bridal shops, Mario's offers big windows for people watching, leather banquettes, and oversized artwork. It's practically law in this borough to start your meal with calamari, and this respite doesn't disappoint-it's refreshingly light and served with a scrumptious, herby lemon sauce. Move on to a tender poached pear salad with crushed walnuts, creamy Gorgonzola, and crispy prosciutto; or fall-off-the-bone osso buco plated with a soft pile of saffron risotto.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Staten_Island-10304-Mario_s-472188-41102
837,Joe's Shanghai,Cuisine Chinese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Simple standard.,"Patience is a virtue at Joe's Shanghai, where a hectic rush to snag a table precedes a visit for the soup dumplings. As with most Flushing restaurants, flavor outdoes the interior decoration, with walls in need of fresh paint and dated furnishings. What the atmosphere lacks, the food fulfills as the kitchen swiftly prepares delicate xiao long bao, that despite stiff competition, still stand a head above the rest. The chefs have perfected the art of wrapping hot liquid into these soft, thin pouches, complete with spiraled shoulders. To bite into a soup dumpling is so sensual that diners don't even bother to glance at the flat-screens hanging in the dining room. While the menu offers fried bean curd and smoked fish, nothing sticks like the dumplings.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Flushing-11354-Joe_s_Shanghai-253772-41102

Simple standard.","Located along quiet Northern Boulevard in Flushing, Hunan House offers a delicious reprieve from the street. The interior is crisp and sophisticated, with dark, ornately carved wood and thick linen tablecloths. But, the real draw here is the wonderfully authentic Hunanese fare, with its myriad fresh river fish; flavorful preserved meats; complex profiles; and mouth-puckering spice. Hunan House's menu is filled with exotic delights, but don't miss the wonderful starter of sautéed sour string beans featuring minced pork, chilies, ginger, and garlic; smoky dried bean curd with the same preserved meat; or spicy sliced fish-Hunan style, perfectly cooked and served in a delicious pool of fiery red sauce and plated with tender bulbs of bok choy.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Flushing-11354-Hunan_House-259884-41102
839,O Lavrador,Cuisine Portuguese,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"This throwback pleases with rib-sticking Portuguese fare and an attention to hospitality. Choose between two experiences: the long, well-worn bar (which may be rowdy with soccer fans) or the spacious dining room, reached through lovely arches. Seasoned servers know how to charm and keep customers patient, as dishes are made to order and can take time. Zoom in on anything with bacalhau here, a superior air-dried fish (not salt-cured) with excellent flavor and texture. The bacalhau à pescador sates with a stew of clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, and potatoes. Another appealing soup is caldo verde full of meaty collards and smoky chorizo. Round out this elaborate feast with feijoada de mariscos, a slurry of white beans, seafood, and of course, more chorizo.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Jamaica-11435-O_Lavrador-468351-41102

On any given night, its cozy booths are packed with islanders slinging back colorful cocktails and digging into architecturally designed sushi and sashimi from the Asian-fusion menu. Presentations are a knockout here, and the creativity and precision extends to the quality and combination of ingredients as well. Case in point: the aptly named Staten Island, a shrimp tempura roll topped with thin slices of seared filet mignon and dollops of mint-honey mustard and spicy aïoli. Sink your teeth into the long-braised short ribs, which are fall-off-the-bone tender and served with Korean galbi sauce and ""pee wee"" potato chips made from those adorably tiny tubers.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Staten_Island-10306-Fushimi-208895-41102

Good standard.","This beloved Queens institution enjoys fine digs where they serve popular and praise-worthy Korean food. The contemporary dining room is spacious and airy, with the warm, always informative, staff buzzing from table to table. It's not uncommon for the manager to roll up her own sleeves when the pace elevates-and elevate it does, for this is not your average Korean barbecue. It's hard to go wrong on Hahm Ji Bach's delightful menu, but don't miss the samgyeopsal, tender slabs of well-marinated pork belly sizzled to crispy perfection tableside for you to swaddle in crisp lettuce with paper-thin daikon radish, spicy kimchi, and bright scallions; or the mit bachan, a hot clay pot with soft steamed eggs, kimchi, tofu, pickled cucumbers, and spicy mackerel.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Flushing-11355-Hahm_Ji_Bach-258086-41102

It's worth the trek to this far-out Jamaica restaurant, full of hip-hop music, brightly colored murals of palm trees, and an unbridled enthusiasm for heat and colliding Sri Lankan flavors. The biryani is steamed for hours in a bubbling blend of cardamom, nutmeg, paprika, bay leaves, and star anise, then tossed with garlic- and ginger-marinated chicken and okra-a blast of flavor on the palate. Further rock your world with the string hopper kothu, mutton curry filled with noodles and a fistful of herbs and spices-think cardamom, cloves, and turmeric. To cool off, treat your tongue to the watalappam coconut custard, spiked with bits of buttery cashew.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Jamaica-11432-Spicy_Lanka-443152-41102
843,Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong,Cuisine Korean,From 25 USD    to 49 USD,Good standard.,"The Korean barbecue of the moment is a short LIRR trip away, and well worth the ride. This was the first East Coast branch of (Korean wrestler and TV personality) Kang Ho Dong's growing empire-and it is already among the best in the city. A younger sib now resides in midtown. The menu is focused, the space is enormous, the air is clean, and the service is friendly. Start your grill off with steamed egg, corn, cheese, and more to cook along the sides while marbled pork belly or deeply flavorful marinated skirt steak strips sizzle at the center. Bibimbap is a classic rendition, mixing beef seasoned with gochujang, vegetables, sesame, nori, and crisp sprouts in a hot stone bowl-so hot that it sears the bottom rice to golden while cooking the raw egg on top.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Flushing-11354-Kang_Ho_Dong_Baekjeong-436446-41102

The inside feels like a large cottage with stone walls and arched windows. Alfresco lunch on the flagstone terrace showcases this high, hilly setting with unparalleled views of the Palisades (squint to find the George Washington Bridge). The American menu features a fried risotto cake with gooey mozzarella over Tokyo turnips and sweet pea coulis; or a hunk of seared tuna with tiny mushroom-filled ravioli. Profiteroles are a particular treat, filled with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with luscious chocolate sauce. The gorgeous surrounds and jazz concerts make this a sought-after spot for private events after sun down.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10040-New_Leaf_Cafe-113439-41102

Beloved by the local Puerto Rican community, the front room is minimally adorned and often filled with lines of those waiting for to-go orders. Snag a seat in the back-where bright walls are flooded with photos-for friendly table service. Begin with morcilla, a thick blood sausage bright with chili peppers, cilantro, and garlic before moving on to the succulent pernil, pork shoulder roasted to a luxuriously crisp exterior and served with stinging garlic sauce, rice and beans, and plantains.

A glance at the wall of politicos and celebrities who have dined here proves how well-loved it truly is. The space is divided into two very different areas: a classic lunch counter also serving takeout, and a dark wood dining room. A wonderful Nuyerican accent can be heard at gathering family tables and tasted in classic dishes like mofongo al pilon de bistec (savory shredded beef over mashed plantains) or pernil con arroz y gandules (roasted pork with pigeon peas and rice). Prices become even more reasonable when you realize that dishes are big enough to be split three ways. Daily sopa specials are a highlight, but end meals with hot and flaky cheese-filled pastelito.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Bronx-10472-Joe_s_Place-335733-41102

Dressed in silly costumes, the staff is always having a blast in this seasonally decorated shack-like dining room featuring corrugated metal roofs, street lights, buckets for shells, and walls papered in dollar bills. Booths along the edge are filled with noisy regulars. The kitchen serves the ocean's bounty, starting with a deliciously crisp and gargantuan pancake, pajeon, studded with seafood and kimchi begging to be dipped in enticingly salty soy-sesame sauce. A cloudy soup bobbing with tofu arrives piping hot, boasting that sharp, nutty, telltale flavor of fermented bean curd, and seems to have its own restorative powers.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Flushing-11358-Sik_Gaek-270964-41102

Simple standard.","Murray Hill is no stranger to Korean food, but this prized, pig-loving barbecue destination is always packed. Inside, the bright room's décor forgoes all frills to focus on regional specialties. Smiling servers are earnest and hospitable. Begin with the usual but very exquisite banchan like pickled turnips, fermented bean paste soup, and specially aged house kimchi-funky, garlicky, and a total pleasure. Bowls of glassy naengmyun noodles dancing in a chilled broth with kimchi are just as popular. Yet what makes this place unique is that barbecue grill on each table, used for sizzling slices of flavorful duck with miso, garlic cloves, and bean sprouts; spicy, tender bits of octopus; and sweet, fatty pork with soy sauce, red chili paste, and scallions.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Flushing-11358-Tong_Sam_Gyup_Goo_Yi-435421-41102

The small interior is brightened with gold walls, a fuchsia ceiling, and three stars set in the fuchsia coffered ceiling. Exposed brick and a semi-open kitchen complete the comfortable scene. Conversation is common between the pleasant servers and other diners, as searing hot sopa with shredded chicken and a nest of fideos, is placed on an immaculate table. The bistec Estrellita is served with a fiery habanero sauce, topped with pico de gallo, and flanked by a side of rice and beans. Flan is a lovely finish-though that generous steak may fulfill even the heartiest appetite.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Bronx-10458-Estrellita_Poblana_III-208889-41102

One of the most highly regarded restaurants in the borough, this storied Italian-American is the kind of charmer that makes groups feel right at home. It's also the kind of place that piles on the pasta and takes espresso seriously, whether it's the fettuccine special that features fresh shaved truffle, the soft-shell crabs finished in a butter-white wine sauce, or the ricotta cream that fills an insanely good cannoli. For a real taste of what makes Roberto's shine, let the hearty tubettini con polipo e fave, folded with grilled octopus, fava beans, and baby clams speak for itself.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/New_York-10458-Roberto_s-113430-41102

The popular bar invites local business owners and faculty from nearby Fordham University for casual conversation, while the kitchen churns out steaming plates of glistening clams oreganata and rich pastas delivered by a careful service team. The nostalgic Sunday special-pillow-soft gnocchi topped with tomato gravy and slow-braised pork braciola tucked with garlic, parsley, and cheese-is worth an end-of-weekend quest.

Brick and cement archways, high ceilings, and a second-floor dining terrace strive to keep that oven-and its wares-within each table's line of vision. The menu showcases Salerno-style cooking with pizzas, baked pastas, and wood-fired entrées. In fact any dish that is ""al cartoccio"" (in parchment) is sure to please. Open up this pouch to try the pitch-perfect al dente radiatori baked with porcini, cherry tomatoes, breadcrumbs, and loads of deliciously spicy sausage.

Responsible for the success behind this tiny spot is Chef/owner Marco Coletta, who directs the front and back of house with the precision of an air traffic controller and the passion of an Italian nonno. This sincerity shines through in the cooking, from the ethereally light gnocchi di patate in a rich lamb ragù to the quickly pan-fried fillet of sole francese nestled in a creamy lemon sauce with shrimp, parsley, and white wine. Only a few desserts are on offer, and all are made in house. For a classic finale, go with the ricotta cheesecake.",https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/Bronx-10458-Tra_Di_Noi-186021-41102

Shingara, vegetable pakoras, and samosas are always available. This is in addition to a parade of daily specials: chandal, yellow lentils, is seasoned with garlic, ginger, and cumin; jumbo prawns or golda chingri are simmered in a thick sauce of spiced coconut milk; and gura mas, pan-fried small fish, swim in a tangy purée of greens and mustard oil.

Daily specials could include anything from a complex mole to slow-braised goat with broth, though the menu is rife with options. Begin with a torta, stuffed with steak, layers of beans, avocado, onions, lettuce, and a bright chipotle mayo.

White leather chairs, cotton panels, and rustic tables lend a breezy feel. Italian and Italian-American classics span the wide menu, from grilled calamari with a mild tomato sauce topped with peppers and black olives, to ridged tubes of manicotti stuffed with ricotta and pecorino, cooked in a meaty Bolognese and finished with a rich béchamel.

Spaghetti Frank Sinatra is a stain-making bowl of slippery pasta loaded with shrimp, clams, olives, and capers in chunky tomato sauce. A light touch is seen in the grilled vegetables, topped with paper-thin cremini mushrooms.

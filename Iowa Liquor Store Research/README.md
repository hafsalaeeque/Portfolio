# Hello All!!!

Given my Marketing background I thought it would be fun to see how I can combined what data science skills I have learned with my 
marketing knowledge in somewhat of a 'Market Research' problem.

Iowa has a Liquor problem! Not the 'AA' type, but that there are not enough stores to handle the statewide alcohol demand. 
Using the statewide sales data from 2015 and some of 2016 I'm going to identify some ideal county locations for opening some new stores.

The 'TL;DR' of my research show that Dickinson would be the best county for further investigations as far as opening up a new Liquor Score.

I did some of the visual analysis using Tableau.  The link to that viz is below.

In the near future I plan on coming back to this data with additional information about political offiliations within Iowa and trying to see if there are any relations between Politics and Drinking Habbits.  It should be fun!
